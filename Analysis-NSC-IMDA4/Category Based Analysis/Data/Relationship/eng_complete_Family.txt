eh Nads</P2 I haven't seen you in a long time ah
me too ah like as usual ah you know
so like okay ah so I know you recently came back from Australia ah how was it ah Nads</P2
mm
mm right right
then like
what what you study over there ah like in Australia
uh uh
mm
ya ya alright
me what school
now I in ah
Singapore Poly ah that's
mm
so like okay so
err for like my third year kan
need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job ah
so like
ya that's why ah cannot ah you know
for me I don't know ah we usually we like homesick ah you know so I go
on overseas
ah
uh I haven't pick yet ah any yet
club activities kan so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
mm
ya
mm
okay ah I find floorball quite interesting ah like
but like honestly it's not something I like ah as a sport ah you know if
uh sports ah I will definitely choose something else ah
maybe like okay so for they got clubs ah
okay so you know got different schools right
then you got my school lah called the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs ah
so my one is uh club
uh interview eh um when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply kan then I went for the interview
ah that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like walao eh
ah
ya that's why
ah that's why mm
ya ya true ah it's okay lah
sports
clubs ah I think clubs can ah but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can ah so possible
kay
so like for you kan Nads</P2
your school what what course you take ah for you I know you are in year one but what course ah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
then what are the modules you will like learn
mmhmm
mmhmm okay
ah
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me lah cause I got experience in secondary school kan
ah like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is uh about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A ah you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun ah for me
really enjoy ah cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun lah
ya
ya
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three ah is where like the interesting part lah
cause no no no before the internship kan
what ah the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine uh fuel system you know so like for us uh students right before we go for internship right you must understand ah all these kind of uh machinery how it works
cause if we just go for uh what ah
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills ah before our internship
oh what also ah
oh ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this mm
eh they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
uh
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like uh as the water level rises so it's about five minutes ah it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the okay eventually the water level will rise lah but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast ah ya
ya
ya that's why
that test ah honestly I haven't experienced yet ah cause I only year two now ah but something I look forward to ah
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or err what you call the inspector lah so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into lah like that ah ya
ya hopefully ah mmhmm
not bad ah not bad ah
spend a lot of time playing game ah
oo shiok ah I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
mm so something ah
something to kill time also ah in secondary school you know
then for you eh your free time what you normally do ah
mmhmm
mm ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what got any I join right then for you eh cause like you know you are like
uh year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any for your poly have or not
legit ah
mm
mmhmm
oo
mm
so okay ah based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first ah cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a like promoting for you to join right so you go see lah which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
so maybe you can make it to what uh Temasek poly uh floor ball team ah who knows ah
ya who knows who knows but I know the floor ball team very competitive ah
know
see which one you like the most y'know
oh
today ah I just finished my
last paper you know today
uh got a lot of content you know like one module can have like what eighteen chapters crammed into one one two hour paper
oh my goodness legit
so much to study
okay ah hopefully hopefully ah hopefully hopefully can pass ah
but then ah after the paper like
for what ah
it's for like
for my
infection ah or it's like how to say it's like a pimple lah you know in a sense and it bleeds ah so I have to go for appointment ah

advising on the surgery
like okay ah
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery ah cause like I'm only eighteen kan

cause this surgery is it's like
quite risk ah quite high risk ah
have to like what cut open that one put me on anaesthesia
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya
uh pull a skin
so I cannot imagine ah a'ah
ah confirm painful sia legit

three doctors in the room ah then they wanted to inspect the you know you know
the wound
then I like quite scared ah then they start pinching pinching the wound then a lot of like the

you know when you're like kay now

then there is like you must start studying right you know do you ever like procrastinate when you want to study
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
for me ah I also procrastinate lah like you know I prioritize my err playing games over doing work ah my assignments ah
very close right then I'll start doing ah
like I would set a timetable
for me to plan out my time ah you know because if
kan like if I submit late then the lecturers will penalize me what so I obviously have to start on doing ah
but there are some points where like know procrastination like took over ah then I miss out some of my tutorial I have to submit
you know but I do blame myself for it ah you know
but it's something that I have to you know
tackle ah this issue of procrastination cause like
always ah since secondary school ah
always prioritise my games over the
mm wah
damn
ya it is hard lah but you know we must lah you know
it's very hard lah then okay like okay
through I believe that there are like some modules that involves in like group projects or like
ya group projects like that
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
wah
mm
mm
okay
me ah okay I have ah okay recently
social innovation project ah uh ya
I think combined with
uh different types of uh people from different courses ah so like
uh
to do a project together so basically this like
what is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry ah
so equips you with this kind of skill lah but let me tell you something ah I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you ah
cause like err it's damn rabak I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like walao eh why why got so much workload ah ah I don't want do ah like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
ah
like this
ya
ah then okay okay this one ah it happen like
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal ah for our presentation slides
then these guys right
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate ah
then
oh then they say eh why like that we you the only malay just come lah then I say how can like that I holiday what hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
oh my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining ah keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school designs right
or like do some drawing design kan
ah alamak legit I tell you I don't want ah but it's okay lah
ya but overall I think it's a good experience lah
cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together ah
and also ya it's good lah so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made uh okay you know for our project our aim right
to help people with depression integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely kan
ah they are like damn lonely right
alamak why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use ah then we decided to come up with something interesting for them lah cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
uh our the depression app ah counter
Pikachu ah Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
kay so what's so special about this tab right
uh when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app kan they can uh what ah uh
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual controls right so when they talk then they type right say uh how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
mm it's it's quite cool lah honestly
and also err
you can also prompt for
uh real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one uh what uh questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool lah ya
ya um and also for our app right uh we also put what ah
uh since like most of us like like to game ah like we
most um people like to game like they download apps for what
uh games right
for most people right then
ah our app introduces like some mini short games ah so you got heard of uh what kind of games ah err like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
ah Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
some mini games ah like also we put uh animal crossing ah concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
um
games for the user to play with ah which makes our app interesting ah
ya a lot of people ah
mm
ya so our app
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
ah
what ramen or some like cookie eh
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon ah which is I think quite cool ah so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to ah ya
forward to ya
so that's about it ah for my module interesting ah
mmhmm
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong uh
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two ah
ya semester two ah
it's called err
ah communicative I can't remember ah what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
uh improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach ah like one of them is ah time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance ah it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right kan do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what ah
what's that ah
oh your interview skills ah
for interview
he teach us uh the basic questionnaire ah like how to prep ourselves for interview
err what should we ask during an interview you know how to properly answer an interview
so I think is quite that one ah manageable
ah
ya
ya
so I respect ah for doing that
y'know
like I always stutter you know but like how in the future how are you gonna present yourself like why why would the company want to pick you over other people kan
so you have to present yourself better
so which is what this module is teaching ah
how to how to out
outstand ah among the other other interviewees ah
ya
so it's quite good lah since
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm then okay

and my course right the worst thing right is that people of my age right don't have you know like there was only one or two most of them were like two or three years older than me you know

it's kind of like a more singaporean Reddit kind of thing
have you still been using Reddit lately
vikings

thinking of buying what assassin's creed or
but
eh
but do you play the first few assassin's creed series
brotherhood I don't really remember playing eh no I don't think I finished brotherhood I played two
I think I was the one who told you to play two right was it

I don't know actually I don't know what around bugis is ah
ya never mind ah
I not interested anymore
I don't know
I think I need to translate this page ah

I don't think they were pirates or something lah I think you I think you
anyhow only ah
are you googling
are you googling uh malay pirates or something
uh huh
are you on the must share news dot com that one the seven facts about bugis people
why
ya ya ya there's something about pirates ah okay lah this page is in english so its a bit easier to
the boogeyman is out to get you
the the bugis man uh
that your ancestors were pirates ah
I don't know sia
uh huh
eh so you actually contemplating on putting a tattoo of a pirate ship on your thigh
orh but like of all the things a pirate ship ah that's like
that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something uh
ya
sure sure
the spur of the moment that kind of thing eh
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through lah huh
but you would think
huh
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of angmohs
but the angmohs were like you're you're so cool
ya lah he working at some burger
on the arm
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
uh huh
orh I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people ah
brand tattoos for her friends that kind ah
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first lah
ha
actually
ah like cupping
you know what's cupping
ya ya the one that they put the suction cup on your on your back
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part lah
I think like this is what tattooing feels like ah
you see how it feels ah
like getting injections over and over again
okay lah I guess
maybe
but he was doing it quite fast ah
like really rapid
uh huh
uh huh
was that on impulse also or what
uh huh
uh huh
that your sisters what
oh ya ya
uh huh
uh huh
oh
okay lah so anyway it's kind of like fated ah that you
weren't supposed to get that tattoo ah
or do you like keep it all from her
then her friend is like the party kind ah
oh
orh so they know what you are up to lah
are you gonna go mexico do you have any plans to go mexico soon

ah
uh huh
but you don't remember ah
ah
not like the hit up other girls kind of satan ah
mm
uh huh
dude you remember or you don't remember
okay lah I guess it turn out for the better lah huh
well I just I just finished my reservist today also ah
never sia
then
it was to make up for the last duties mistakes ah more like it
ah
half was that half was
half was like
so they were
that was the other half lah the other half was
but ya other than that
err what time ah
like
uh ya
ya
orh
ah
sia
oh then my medical call
not bad ah
quite interesting ah
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill lah yes ah okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
then we reached the lift lobby
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
err are you the one who called just now then the guy was like ah ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he oh his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is uh pretty rare ah to to to see like shocks getting given by the ah
ya but the guy
uh huh
oh
orh but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping ah
I I think so
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
oh
compulsory to what
oh serious ah
ah
uh huh
okay lah I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay lah that guy quite nice the the community responder
cause he was at home ah he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
uh huh
ah
ah
so from from no breathing no pulse ah
oh ya that guy
uh huh
uh huh
confirm gone ah is it
uh huh
got the what again
ah the the one and two and three and four and that kind ah
ah
wait that was a doctor ah
it isn't you know
sian sia
who gets to do as in nobody want to do oh nobody wanna do
why sia
uh
huh
but uh
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also lah so he was saying that
cause
orh
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is lah but like
no point
oh
so can what
huh
ah ya ya the ugly one lah
oh
ya ya
oh ya I ding was telling us lah
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the lah recall
ah
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
oh
mm mm
okay ah
cause I came also like
then go up
but okay lah fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress lah cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no lah but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya lah definitely sia
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge lah but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the ah take charge
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
but now makes sense ah
ya
and fire bike
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
oh
uh huh
eight people
wah
oh
but wonder how often it's actually being used lah in
ah
ah
eh my friend from paya lebar also the madam told them don't turn out sia
they said they want to minimise
ah they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
ah fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I suay ah my
ya sia
don't know ah apparently it's the first time ah that
only the
they said because of the or something ah
but I don't know ah not really buying it
okay ah bo pian ah just go ah
then they also all the all the people were like
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
ya so it's called double meaning ah
so like
ya lah so must just be extra alert
okay lah but as in bishan usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
not bad lah at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay lah interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
ya
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different sia
what didn't you download the app
ah
uh huh
I think for you all different lah cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay ah
download what
oh no lah I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
oh the card ah
oh for a as a reservist ah
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
uh huh
uh huh
what did I what did I teach you
oh
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
uh huh
oh I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected ah
oh ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know ah
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
uh huh
uh huh
that one they are not choking already ah

to for the bridging oh no you cannot then you have to go this
ah
ah
it's exam-based also lah I mean written written exam
how many choices she have
but
line kan must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses eh
ya I mean with this combination diploma
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam lah kan
no choice
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
now is december
mm
orh

her

is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside

uh the fee ah to go to go inside

uh can watch lah old people cannot watch lah
why why why not they um
uh what was that revive uh superman's life eh
if a old time uh superman eh I think I will watch ah
I I I I prefer superman other than any other Marvel
ah heroes ah
uh what was that uh superman uh
powerful character ah compared to other marvel heroes ah
mm
hulk also
eh
ah right
ah ah
so last time when I watch hulk eh last time eh uh series eh they no no no nothing
ah there was actual visual
I like uh I like the the series very much ah those days ah
superman uh hulk

and ah for me I like adventurous and not so violence ah
I like adventurous ah and then also
I like to watch fairy tales movie
uh as well like cinderella
snow white
uh I think
uh I I prefer to watch this this kind of fairy tales ah
uh
ah should be no problem ah kan
uh I I think uh
ah we can go there what
ah
I can try baby pool first ah
or you can try deep pool also what
ah I I I think I think we can try ah swimming
you can try your skills
no it's it's quite uh no uh wasted tau
if you you know how to swim you better use use your skills
correct not so this time round you can use the deep pool don't worry lah maybe can we we we we can try slowly
alright then after that you can uh sharpen up your your your your swimming your swimming skills
then after that we can go east coast
ah
so east coast you were to go deeper or you want to go to the shallow
uh and then how how uh and then how you get how you got the way how you run away
he carried you ah okay lah so so
oh but then
uh you sounded not okay lah but then end end up okay ah
okay lah should be no problem lah
so so so hopefully so uh you what's that in sec one sec two you you had
uh several
uh practices kan ah I think should be should be okay
ah
practice
ah
ah
so if you go to east coast maybe we can take a shallow one ah
ah slowly
ah so gradually we can we can really do lah correct or not
I mean it's a waste ah
you can uh we will just we we we we send you to go swimming
uh swimming courses and then after that end up
you cannot swim I mean you are afraid to swim ah
ah
bedok swimming pool
ah pity ya actually actually I want to try also
how to swim also

it's not I'm scary it's not I I'm I'm too scared ah actually I also can practise also
ah
so so so I I I think I can I can practise if I practise I can better become better than you ah
ah
so be beside swimming what's your what's your other fear ah height height is it
oh okay
okay okay
even though it took uh long longer time for you to to complete the course
did someone help you along

mmhmm
mm
I don't think that's going to work in fact
mm
mmhmm
ya
good luck to you eh
uh uh I'm like
at this point I don't know whether he's trying to make it funny ah
if I can if I can make you smile by making this funny why not
ya that little spark of happiness you know

eh then you pass by so fast eh
don't you think so like with COVID like wow where did all the time go
ya
miss travelling eh do you miss travelling
ya but if mm you could pick a destination where do you think you will travel to uh
um like before COVID lah
new
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van wah love those time seh
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way lah you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van wah that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places lah
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya eh you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
eh but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience eh
oh my god
serious eh
okay okay okay
eh but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
mm
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match ah so my cousin and I didn't keep up
ah K
oh okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K lah at least you were sort of prepared for it lah to happen
I don't know what's nice over there
err melbourne was quite nice right eh or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it ah
like it was like an um
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
ah my god super super shiok
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
wow like that's an experience you won't get here seh
ya lah ya lah that's true lah
ya
ya yes
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also lah
ya more more expensive places err like
those I don't lame places lah like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
eh but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless what
that's true
eh but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know selangor pass selangor
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun eh but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that ah to get to thailand by car
yes yes definitely need to stop in lah like I need my dose of man
ah
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
oh ya never thought of that ah
ya ya ya ya correct correct
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling lah
we drove that camper van right and then we got through err got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice what
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck ah to explore the ferry kan
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it lah
ya correct
ya correct
ya eh you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
I don't know if you do lah but that's just me
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh wow I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know ah oh it's just damn different ah or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
ya
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had err more like
ya but if I had to pick
amorino K amorino is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and messina for the range
ya I think
ya because but wow messina has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
ya
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything ah
gelato messina ah hands down ya
ah what what do you call it mm what was it like yuzu and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya mm
eh and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce wah best seh
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
ya best donuts seh
ya
mm
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
oh ya that's eh so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
uh I think it's the donut itself ah
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like wow oozing out ah
correct correct ya
like honeycomb custard or something wow
wow like mind blowing seh
ya that was interesting ah ya
eh what what was that like curry curry eh
ah thai green curry eh
I I remember I remember there was something like um
ah plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice lah
oh to like caramelized the whole thing ah is it
that was also like a random find right
ya
oh K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually um in dragon's den as in
ah okay okay okay
ya
like you know when we were craving for
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant prata over there lah
ya but ya lah I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there lah
mm
what what what what do you miss
okay okay
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like um things on the menu
a pie pie face
ya that was nice also
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember ah
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess ah I guess
ya
of course lah we had to what
ya
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there ah even though it's in a thousands
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot ah
and because those factory outlets kan have everything under one roof tau
bicester kan bicester
bicester
we were so noob man
oh and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain kan yes yes yes
eh it's a once in a lifetime chance seh we never know if we are going to pass by that place again lor
trying to recall lah
err
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
enchanted garden or something
no no no it's not luge
fifty eh
fifty sing ah
ah okay eh what what else was it that we did over there
ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then um
ya I just remember that that thingy ah what is it called ah
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to lah eh but the beaches there were nice eh
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
ya at did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
mm we really miss the nature ah
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya eh but malaysia nature not bad leh actually
ya
mm
no lah you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya but okay lah I mean like okay langkawi has nice beaches
okay lah it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can ah while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have uh know two thousand maybe
wait what did you go to spain for
oh
eh but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
and then
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare ah
huh
so basically you were trying to catch your train err trying to catch your flight you mean
serious
oh my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
mm
okay okay and like the timing wise
okay no cash on hand lah you mean
okay
mm mm
uh huh
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
oh I see like how much it's supposed to cost ah
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
oh wah were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him lah
mm
start of an adventure eh
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
eh wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
ya ya like uh
mm mm
mm
oh I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
mm
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
mm
okay
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the prata was huge
then
oh
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
ah okay okay okay
I see I see
yup
oh
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me lah I've never I've never encountered this before so
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees ah it's just the shoppers will probably be like ah what are we going to do now at such an early time like uh we still want to shop
oh K K eh what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
mm
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay lah not a lifelong dream but
ya lah ya lah that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy kan
ya ya that's why lah
mm
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
wow okay
mm
mm
um circles and stuff
active eh ah okay
oh right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas ah

oh last night my friend
video called me until until so late
my two guy friends one of them
uh no the the guy the one in the girlfriend
called with us ah but he himself is not there
so the three of us
video called without him for the surprise
uh yeah
ya lah
it's a surprise it's called a surprise
so uh we we got plan A and plan B
I mean I mean
of course have to come up with a solid plan right
no plan A uh plan A we go we go Sentosa
the beach lah
come as a surprise
yes I think it'll be fine
why ah
why sia
so weird
no so go Sentosa uh we come with a cake and some light snack I think like Pezzo eh
then ya
then uh we get this combo
you know that now they are promoting tourist stuff for Singaporeans right
yeah so there's packages that you can visit different places
yeah so we we are we are going we are going for this package which which is like uh forty two dollars
or go
uh the wax museum
Tussauds
ya I think it's that one
uh the wax museum some Marvel
some Marvel
dah that's one for one you know means we can split into two lah
ya so split into two uh
one for one so two lah
yes
yeah
then uh that that wax museum uh
uh later ah but basically
basically uh those are our activities lah for the day
yeah then
after that uh they want to eat at satay by the bay is it
I've never been there my entire life
yeah
uh
no I know where it is I know
I know where it is but I've never been there to eat
no it's like a hawker centre
but very
the ambience the ambience is no it doesn't it's outdoor
night it's dinner
mm
ya so that's our dinner plan then second
uh plan B is
me and the not birthday guy
we go there and set uh we go Marina Barrage
yes we go Marina Barrage uh
we set up like a small
glamping something like that
ya but this one we
ya but now we do our own
this is Marina Barrage got anyone do tentage meh I never see before
no people just sit down and hang around there
ya
because there were other people lah that's the best we could find actually
obviously lah everyone will aim for that spot got shade what
it's two onwards
I would think we'll reach there three plus ah this is our plan B
um
but I say that will be very suspicious
he always park there then like
it's like it's like we might be meeting someone
I told them that
ya lah like caught them off guard kind so
yes
yeah can
ya
you must you must give the poker face like nothing is happening
no
he will definitely follow
uh on your birthday I already have something planned so you know
almost two years
eh or is it more than two I don't know lah but
long enough lah
ya
anyway
ya then that's sort of like the deciding factor ah then I said okay then another if if let's say
then we go Marina Barrage because it's easier
what was the deciding factor again I forgot ah
no okay wait no if we have a car we go to Marina Barrage
I don't like to waste time
yes yes
but
then I'm like he cannot lah
yeah
yeah
I honestly think Marina Barrage is a good idea
but but
okay I'm okay no okay oh wait wait wait
no we all like the activity we all can agree on that it's just that we know that we are starting late oh yes I remember the deciding factor
yeah
weekday cannot lah he what
then
so you see three plus
we can enjoy the activity the package got five different place you know
where got time to
no no we didn't choose that there there is a package with cable car but we didn't choose that
no
it's not really
I know got Shah Rukh Khan
you've been with me at Hong Kong
what I say just now
no then like oh yeah that's the deciding factor because sometimes
say he don't want to go for class ah he skip that week's class
yeah
then I but I told her lah uh whatever it is we don't be the one to tell him
we don't be the one to tell him not to go for the class lah it's wrong
yeah
yeah I mean if he wants to let him decide on his own
if he
Tampines ah
I think ah
no actually don't know
I think he usually come back Tampines he don't like to go back that house
no lah but he he always bring motor he will always pick up her first and she stay near Tampines hub there
so
no
near Tampines hub
yeah
yeah but ya lah he he likes
yeah
ya ya that's the deciding factor now I remember
attraction in Sentosa
yeah
six last eh entry eh something like that
ya lah which which means that there is five activities so if from three o'clock you wanna cut cake eat first that will be four plus already
cause we bring a small cake
err it's very he
yeah well they all want it that way
I okay jer
yeah
I give my opinions but you know uh eventually I feel that the one that has more say is the girlfriend lah cause
she would know how to get him there or
I like surprising people
I'm pretty good at it
but yeah I mean there will be a time where I'll be like you also right
so let me enjoy my youth
let me enjoy my youth okay
yeah but I really I really hope that we go Marina Barrage
yeah it's simpler
then like
food lah estimate
he said last time he went he paid three hundred plus
but but with eleven people
then like I got a shock ah I'm like what in the world three hundred plus
all guys yes I must add that all guys
so it's like
and it was during the time so they are probably really hungry
and I was telling them ah
I was telling them uh I'm a very picky eater you know and like I don't know what's there so
I was saying that to the girlfriend
yeah
then
I don't I told her I don't eat satay
I really don't
yeah
eh but the place looks nice they wanna go DuitSg actually
I don't know but I know it's a famous place right now people are always going there
Canberra Canberra
DuitSg
uh they sell their specialty is what ah
I don't I don't eat this kind of thing lah okay
I hate that question because like I really don't know where to go
you just make up your mind and then I follow
it's okay lah just go with the flow if cannot then cannot lah
we can just like
but like
very light food lah
cannot eat cannot eat I okay jer
um
hmm
uh eh mm
that that that that's a
that's a good
then I'm like
then I'm like okay guys anywhere I don't know much you all decide about food
ya about food I really don't care
all I need is drink
I okay as long as I have water bottle with me
yeah
it was super hot bro
ya ya they did mention that
ya
anyway ya so that's the plan lah
um
then we talk about like other things lah
she you you can tell that she really put in effort to
yeah
that's what she say ah
I do a lot of things so
I'm like uh I think FaceTime better ah but like ten thirty onwards
ya so ten thirty onwards yesterday they call me until one plus
ya then
who the two guy friends and me that is our clique we have other friends but
Arshad
one big group
yes yes yes that's right
so he is in that big group
okay in that big group there's the three of us
inside got that circle three of us then inside this big group got another
slightly bigger circle the one that come over to eat
yeah lah you know
those people
no those people lah
those people are like the other group
overlap meaning
oh the thing is uh out of the three of us that two guy friend and me
yeah so so
so he he said what for attend such thing
like so he likes to be within this three of us
yeah
ya bubt it's easy for him to do that because he wasn't he's not one of the girls right he wasn't even close to her to begin with
yeah
yeah so he don't like
yeah
yeah yeah
then
ya then ya lah
so but then we
they know
they know how close I am with the other two
they I told you right they are going this weekend
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when I I said in the group I was busy you guys
no then then
then I'm like no ah don't let me be the deciding factor ah
mm ya true so
now now I'm just like okay go ahead lah
it's okay
then I say lah anyway
and I'm always used to be the odd one out so
if we go in odd numbers
I've been out with three people to and it sucked
ya
ya ya
and it really sucked
because every ride of course she would wanna go together with the other girl
uh I mean huh I don't mind
I don't mind I'm not
I enjoy lah but you must go with the right group of friends
so far the best experience I had was probably with Humaira and marissa
yeah I realised that uh I enjoy going out with
I enjoy just one more person don't need like a group
yeah
ya that's how I feel with the two guy friends lah I mean
other than the fact that they are two guys
I okay
yeah
I don't also what
ya you see like like Ria
like I just go with another person anyway that one no
that one
that one no choice
only the two of us
mm
it's okay lah
I mean yeah they go see they are going they are asking about the price haven't buy the ticket
sunday
yeah
yeah I know ah
so sad leh is
is because I recognise their faces so it
because they don't look they are not Singaporeans it's easy to tell what
no it's because I went there prominent lah
like
every weekend with different group of friends
during I think that one poly right
during my break
then I get the pass
err towards the end towards the end ya lah third year
okay lah uh
I sorry ah but ya lah that's the difference between you and me lah I enjoy pe
I enjoy all the ride now the rides that I used to be scared of is no longer scary for me
yeah
uh red one not blue
dangling I want to tho
hhmm
waste money sia go in take photo
ya lah the vintage car
oh yes
oh ya I remember eating that with Humaira
I remember you were pregnant lah last time when you go with me
crazy
I know
no it wasn't
it clearly stated no pregnant lady should be on this ride
that was early early part lah
yes you are right
crazy crazy woman
yeah you're crazy
it was a thirty second ride lah so
some kids are scared
there is the moment that thing drop what
do you even remember what you took I don't think you remember because you were just having fun
yeah I went with Marissa she was she was screaming her heads off
uh
I got somemore drawing to do
oh ya ya ya ya
ya ya cannot
what was her email ah
need to find her email
mm
ya
ya lah anyway
that's the thing I feel like she's not shy to speak to ask about
stuff also
yeah
she talked she talked about uh how
we were saying lah we know we know the process of how he met her right
so found her Instagram
and then
ya you know the nonsense
nonsense kind of
line lah I mean it's not even true he wasn't even there that's the funny part
so she replied and then they started talking
ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya he knows what he wants ah that kind
ya
that's right
yes
ya err also because he knows himself better lah learnt from mistakes
he will take action
huh
I think a bit lah he's not that bad
it's just that teenager angst you know
back then
ya ya ya whatever you call it
whatever you call it lah
but he changed for the better seriously he changed a lot
ya it's it's that kind of feeling lah
he's only what four right calm down
he's not even going to primary school yet then you will freak out
he will grow up because he meet
a lot of people he would learn how to do things on his own
suddenly you don't even hear him screaming mama anymore he will just mind his own business
mm
I think that's me
I think I share a lot of things happened in school or whatever to
I do that I do that just so she won't feel worried
that's my main objective not really because I want her to know what eh what's happening
no no no
now now as a mother do you think that is right
no right if you see your daughter or son
very quiet you don't know what's happening
I tell you already I don't know I you didn't
yeah yes definitely because I didn't even remember talking to you
you were
ya I feel like you were in your own world
you uh it's like I don't even talk to you I don't even know what's happening in your life
yeah
now now that you mentioned it just now right you got married when I was in sec one
so it sounds a bit funny
teenage ah
yeah but you already bloomed dah
some someone lah
yes
ya
really
oh my god you all nerds
and the teacher never react meh
mm
it's okay what you late but you still study well what
this is what eh
secondary school I very busy with my ah that's all I can say
seriously ah
oh my god even
even without O levels in your way
that is sad
crash landing on you
I do that but at home
yeah but well
seriously so sad no exam also you study very hard
okay lah good good for you lah
some people can do it
what in the world
I don't understand why you cry
oh my god I didn't know you were such a geek
you know you know when it was me in school when there's a surprise test
then I just look at my friends did you did you study no okay
then just do the test lah
I don't I mean
I learned halfway through in my life when I was in school
I learned not to put so much pressure on myself and some things I cannot control
what I mean
school's supposed to be fun don't have to cry over surprise test
I'm talking to you right now
yeah maybe when he's big enough like me next time you can story
yes of course
yeah
but in secondary school I think I was just busy with my and upper sec is my
until seven plus eight
until the
ya lah
it's okay A for effort
crazy
they never see ah I remember my friend
uh doing the practical right so at the back with the
drilling drilling machine it's called drilling what is it called I think so
but it's for acrylic right
she didn't tighten the acrylic properly and she on the drill
so the thing starting spinning so all the
chips flew out then cut cut cut cut cut cut her hand everywhere
and then I was just behind her and then I'm like
off the damn switch lah why are you like you know letting the thing keep on spinning
because she was shocked herself
then then I just
you know acrylic like plastic sharp sharp
cut cut cut cut
the sharp edges
yes
so I just went to the side and pull out the plug
and then my teacher come
you know teachers are usually supposed to be strict right
he just
he laughed he was like what in the world are you guys doing
the drill is nothing wrong it's just where the the the the holder where she put the acrylic she never tighten it properly
yes kiap the thing whatever you call it
but
workshop
can ah
I don't even remember what I did lower sec
see lah what is it
oh you you have those type of days too
oh my god
imagine is Bahril knew this oh my god
nonsense
this is what primary school
eh
you know but truthfully right in secondary school days right
I rarely copy homework
truthfully I do but it's only those where I genuinely forgot to do or those where
it's not really I leave it on purpose I've never done that
crazy
mm
yeah
I also
I do dance performance I do uh
I am a sports coach
and
it's not wrong what
sure sure
sure
if you say so
maths club there's a club for maths
that should be banned
that should be banned
yes
mm
mm
you know what was my brain when I was younger
it was just dancing
drawing colouring I don't remember asking why the ball bounce like that
what is two plus two I don't care
you know
then
I I would be those type of prefect because every single day you're gonna be that late
you deserve it
hmm
wait wait wait wait
ran out of the school
mm
mm
I like those type of people
and then you walked back
why
mm
nice
ya just one detention is nothing lah
there was I think you you you know this story
I
cause I was late right
um but my
my favourite teacher saved me
he stand so the discipline master stand here so all the latecomers right
so um my teacher came then pretend to talk to her then when she turn around
then he look at me then he point run run back to class because my class first floor what
then
the other students is just like
confused
no only me ya
uh then he said run run to class like he pointed to our class
so
no lah cause I'm a good kid of course she wouldn't know me
hmm
my class is not but I am so
I've never made any teacher cry okay
it's not me
three
and my primary school I was in a class that made a teacher cry also
I think my class all very
huh
yeah
my primary school
my my primary school one time only ah
that teacher I think maybe she having a bad day or she's like damn tired already
she's probably just damn tired sick of our attitude
it's not attitude it's just um
you know lah primary school right like to talk talk talk talk talk talk a lot
yeah
who say
then
you can ask her later personally
you you have to have a strong mental strength you have to have mental strength lah
period
I would rather I would rather teach like secondary school
can just off is it

so basically um
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and err so err
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything lah about his life so
true enough lah he is a very uh forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an uh up point for him lah you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
changi airport
um
and that changi airport is what we thought it was lah to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it lah
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then um so now he is uh working at uh novena and he is there because uh he wants to do office work and rightfully so lah because he wants to uh spend more time lah with your family
uh and
since he has going to move towards
getting married uh he thought this the right step ah as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound lah in why he's doing it okay then he talk about um
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay ah this one ah oh every time I do as in ah like
was it so difficult to ah get this out
the mirror the mirror side
ah middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so ah what else um okay so I I
ah okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
ah that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
ah
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact uh do you have connect plan that's he look at me like uh what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years oh we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said lah ya ah six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and ah okay
that's why exactly that's why I say
ya lah but I don't know why they want that place lah anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
ah he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
correct ya
so um ya so that that part they understood lah you know what it's it's spilt milk ready lah kan like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
and then
that's why lah
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk zina whenever zina butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then err
ah revise plan ah ah correct
ah I also don't want to embarrass lah zina cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing zina session but no point lah the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
for zina to actually ah secure a job
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows lah that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working lah and you zena needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience zena hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for zina to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children ah then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
ah that one okay lah they bring about the halal thing lah so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya zina needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
you
grow up
grew up together
ashraf you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
and then
ah come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
ah then they say
okay for me I uh I feel that
so it's like if he lah in the sense that ah so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
then after the whole session also I told zina and even just now I texted saying that
so
of course lah
mmhmm
anyway I
so mm ya then I told him okay ashraf after all that's been said ah I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya lah I said you have
mm
then
um so basically that's it lah and then
at least it's it's clear lah that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
no he will just use
mm like
mm ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage lah
ya
so
ya
sister is working as a librarian but at changi
ya so it's was very easy lah then after when he left also I was telling lah see how easy and simple ashraf
was
by just being upfront
no zina you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
ya lah so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
ya so
like my ah that's why it was very simple lah because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that lah kan
so and he also can recognize lah the value in it and can recognise why you know zina needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that zina needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time zina would be the one taking care of it
ashraf ah because uh
someone needs to be there at home lah he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or zina's parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working lah and then I then I ask him so uh are you exploring the possibility of zina working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
um
okay lor then after then the
in the dining
uh
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear lah clear and upfront
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
for example
um
okay
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
huh
zina is receiving dayah is not there yet
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working ah ah
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
dayah at is at this stage of her life
mm
mm so we don't know that lah huh
basically this this guy ya
that's why
so oh anyway going back to zina I I told zina like
you need to sit down and you really need to uh
figure out the plan on how you gonna
plan it out
fair enough lah if he uh considered um
cause he then I say uh I
uh
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how ashraf is
I told her lah did you see or not what ashraf did
ya
that's why lah she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as oh
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
zina that is not easy-going
mm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going what
you are not um having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
mm
that's why during the
that's why ashraf
if
the way
ya lah of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent lah
I don't think he would lah if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
err
push zina right
pull
pull
ya
consume
step up
mm
so ya basically concludes the whole thing lah with
zina and ashraf then
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya dayah and me then ya I understand that you and dayah are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what hidayah is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
ah
huh
you lah ah then
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
I had the same kind of argument with me and izat I bet you ah you and dayah would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least ah you see ah it me and izat
I'm doubting you know whether you and dayah would apologise to each other
ya ya
that's why lah that's why it seems it's
ya lah
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
what the
like have to see it as steps lah
so
that I mean like
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
so okay lah I think
I can tell that me and izat even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
uh huh
that family comes first
that you need to see that
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya lah so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
we will make it happen
yes so I
and then
mama wah at one okay at one point
mm
nevermind just mm
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like um there was one point where um
then I said zina since when you are that close to izat then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to izat then I say rubbish lah
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
so that's why I told her ya zina you are close to izat because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to izat
izat is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct ah but I say you are close to the boys just because of uh
uh you are close to izat just because the boys uh with izat you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to izat
then I say since when you been talking to izat since when
all all the
you are that close to izat then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys kan
further studies
ah then I then I also
need this person the person ah to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what izat can do this job ah
ah then izat do you think then she's like smile ah aiya lah cannot lah
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
mm that's why
hmm
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward one really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
you know comfortable
ya of course

I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days ah like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and err the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so given that nowadays phones they uh they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me ah I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about oh no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about johor do you remember going to johor
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old johor house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old johor house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
mmhmm now the closest to johor we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there ah
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at uh pulau ubin what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so um what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
mmhmm
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to bugis like literally a five minute walk to bugis if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to bintan
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said oh we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like ah we're choosing to go to hong-kong oh why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so
talk to you another time relay ya oh what time you know
it's a colleague so ya
okay we should uh and our session ya it was nice talking to you poor
okay bye

well if I have
three wishes kan
um the firstly lah I
I would like to become a millionaire
oh ya sorry my last wish is that
I got a lot of friends who from all walks of life I can just um
okay how many options just ah one or two or three
not that good
meal eh
oh overseas okay I got one that I remember
whale meat when I go to japan
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
the taste is really unique lah
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best eh
to that extreme yes
ah
no the wagyu beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
a special kind of breed only for
ya
itaewon the itaewon actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain ah it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up err that hill
then after that if you go down
they are malaysians but the way they cook the bulgogi is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the bulgogi
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
cause I go it's actually
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal lah I I actually go down
nearest park then that's where all the snow is lah
very interesting
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
cause why for I mean for own
and wah I tell you the
okay in japan kan in a middle of
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of lah
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive lah but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
school lah cause err frankly speaking in asia right
really far kan
ah so that is the gist lah actually
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
hundred percent halal they won't accept err alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting kan that's what I when if you go around the world then you see lah
mm
correct correct correct is like that one
uh so they have the alcoholic
for them to to you know to do their things
ah so that is the gist lah
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy ah but again lah like
into youtube kan
ah yes cause garlic is very good lah basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy eh I
healthy
fruits lah I eat fruits lah but uh if you want it
okay ah usually fruits lah I just eat fruits
oh almost everyday is egg lah by right egg is is considered healthy food mah
skills eh meaning what
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code lah code very very well so that I can build
err games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
and that is your business product ah after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
uh one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
all
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause uh again ah
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again uh it's all about the skill set ah if we got
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food ah
just say food
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
goes very deep lah and also very err
they have very rich history uh their okinawan
karate-do aikido
if you're late for one minute eh they totally banned you from the class at all
tense your body means you have more strength but by right okinawa the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
realistic more relax and more
kata it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
to charge at the long distance
to fight the short distance
ah that's why when they have the any competitions
they do not know about okinawan the original one
they are trained not to use any weapons
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use uh a weapon to fight
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really ah do research on it
sorry again
was free
err
yes of course healthcare
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this err
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
I mean that is the realistic view lah but if like you say you ask me again
humans no longer
oh
oh
okay ah
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
mm
everything
so most likely will
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
go to mars maybe go to venus
ah cause I think that is the way to go lah you just want to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
activity eh
meaning what ah
hmm ah eight hours eh
activity eh activity
activity
eight hours eh
wah
no no no is working out
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight eh I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
karma
ya
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke lah if a comical joke easy ah double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause err my life how to say ah
it's a pretty boring lah
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya lah
actor eh err
okay ah actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
um he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one ah also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like err
what troy that
trojan war troy
between this ah
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
that cannot be killed uh then after that
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
ah orh even beyond that um you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that eh
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male ah character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this ah characters also this achilles
uh his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya lah and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used um can really
make if you really into this ah like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful lah I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
ya that's the gist
oh how I keep ah I don't know leh
actually I just went through life ah
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that um
after I read a book for half an hour
all these uh youtube lah especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it lah
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read one
I don't like I would
pictures and of course obviously the videos lah I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right err I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something ah err you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist ah
seventeen years old eh
seventeen years
old self
ah
seventeen
need to know ah you need to give me a time period
seventeen
oh poly eh
err
advice
I don't truthfully ah I don't regret anything
advice eh okay the best thing is
ah
ah actually frankly speaking eh at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago ah and actually
ah if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
even for those like you imagine ah
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
err
things in life yet
your character back then when you
uh
so my character when I was only
that kind of thing so just live life lah
just a live my life that's all lah mm
where do I see myself eh
in five years' time eh okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same ah as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married lah so usually is you do like that
actually
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge
of everything that I'm learning business especially uh
money making invention business so basically is
the coding lah hopefully in a five years' time right the technology that will come out in five years' time which is maybe
a a new youtube or a new facebook
I'll be the one who invent it or who create it wah then I'll be woo
ten years
for houses they say lease ninety nine years

eh hi
ya
okay which plan
okay
ya
per month
okay
so every month you pay how much
okay
so
mm
ya
ya
the same
have you checked
oh okay
ten gigabyte kan per month okay
oh
ya ya
uh
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years eh but I think you just bought kan iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade eh
oh still iphone lah
oh but I think recently you bought kan a new phone
oh
ya
unless you have wifi lah at home you already have wifi kan or
ya
ya
iphone the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
there's about four point seven inch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition ah I don't think so
let me check
there's no more ah sorry they don't sell anymore ah iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven lah so I think for camera wise if you love the camera kan take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough ah iphone eleven uh
not too sure ah cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven ah
ya alamak
who
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off ah
I'm not really looking to job search yet ah cause I'm doing freelance ah so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year lah I try to finish this projects and without expecting much lah I think I think the most important thing is experience ah and the skills that I will acquire ya
once I start working ah I'm more prepared ah prepared than ever
I think it's a bit hard ah because once you already
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test ah they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills ah you have the knowledge
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
ah ya
and they will ask you like on the spot lah like how do you solve this ah ah this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem lah I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is uh that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them lah
ya
it's more mostly interview skills lah that
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
ah monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast ah mm
the expected
oh
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you lah
oh
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
oh okay okay
ya
ya
ya
oh
ya
ya
mmhmm
oh
oh okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
ah the
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm
mmhmm
microsoft office ah
okay okay
oh ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed ah
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is uh I think
oh
mm
ya over work ah
ya
ya
yup understood
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding kan they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable lah you can still read the code ah like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
oh okay okay eh never heard before eh
even though I am a computer science
C hash eh
I think it's called C sharp ah
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before lah during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know lah this kind of
mostly low level lah like C sharp python eh sorry C sharp uh what is it called ah ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable ah than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing ah more structured
ya
mm
how do you spell logs
oh log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error eh
ya
mm
ya ya
ya
ya
ya
I think
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
ya nobody use eh
oh
mm
ya
mm
oh
oh okay
like
ya lah ya lah
clementi house
ya because they are
oh
ya true true
but you never never contact them
but you haven't contact them eh like never contact them
yup true true
uh the rice and
I think I need to start learn I need to start to learn cooking ah
but it's a bit hard ya it's a bit hard
I prefer to cook alone ah
ya
nearby lah
throw the like it's just
ya not much
ya it's not in the fridge ah it's like dried ah dried ikan bilis
ya
ya you you need to get the fish ya fried first ah
ya
it's homemade ah homemade ya
ya
ya capsicum
I think the
ya
but also maid also it's not that cheap ah
cannot cannot like that ah I think most women nowadays is they prefer to work ah kan but depends ah eh
ya
mm
ya
mm
so take turn ah
oh
ya
okay
ya for weekend ah
ya usually once a week kan like sunday
like
ya sunday off
ya
ya of course
mm
ya it's similar ah same as when you go to grocery
ya
then you are like it's like shopping ah
ah it's a virtual ah everything is virtual
ya you cannot be real ah I mean impossible ah but its similar lah it's almost similar like
ya it's like it's like someone
it's the same as you are shopping ah it's like you you are really shopping
ya virtually lah
ya very interesting
ya I think like imagine like walking ah
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab kan
why
access to shopping mall eh is it
mmhmm
oh ya
but I'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally ah I'm not too sure ah there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but I never try before ah I never try using like I I don't think so I tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
mm
ya
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home
ya
the manager will ask ah like what have you done today like it's it's the same it's like the sprint ah sprint adjust chrome
where you go everyday task
ya standard meeting ya
ah you also need to be involved in like zoom zoom meeting
for presentation
ya of course ah I think they are going to make one in singapore kan
ya
ah but I not too sure ah like I heard from the news ya and they were hiring ah mm I think a lot foreigner ah
oh ikea ah I don't I don't think so actually I don't buy like
so maybe I might go with him lah I'm not sure when maybe next week
which one the restaurant ah
of course ah open lah
but they limit ah they limit like
ya they make
one one table kan like ya seat of four or seat of two
ya couple family kan
ya
ya
oh counter table ya
oh
mm
ya yup understand
not too sure ah
oh
shopping mall eh is it like shopping mall
oh okay
ya ya
open concept ah
it's like open concept ah
mm
ya
oh ya ya
mm
mm
ya
mm truth
mm
ya
ya
restaurant or bar kan they they have a lot of
ya
ya lah
of course ah
ya
mmhmm
ambassador
ya
ah true ah
I think just make sure like everyone just follow ah cause now nowadays people like
but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya
to keep track
auto check out
I think possible lah just that location wise is a bit some ah some ya ya true ah some some ah some might be insecure a bit ah like
to be in track kan
trace I think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya I think it's battery I think a lot complain
ya definitely ah bluetooth ya
through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running ah it will still run ya because it need to keep checking kan
I'm not too sure ah I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise ah so I think they need like support of
I think so ah I think it's just the bluetooth ah like because bluetooth will detect the nearby device kan
ya this is not this is not easy ah because because I think they still updates ah they're still updating they are still improving
for apple kan and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone kan
Google
oh
android
mm
oh google home ya
ya
ya
who
google home okay
ya
mmhmm
yup correct
ya
ah ya ya
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
I think so ah
the microphone is how far
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ah there's something
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
like
ya amazon products
ya
oh
mmhmm
I I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
I think not too sure ah like they have their own ya they have their own brand ah I'm not not sure what brand is that ah
maybe maybe they collaborate hmm
I think there might be lah not too sure like
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house ah like or what like
ya
ya because
they use leg
ah pedal pedal ya so they have to use
uh our hand lah our hand to press the button
ya
paya lebar ya I saw I went to paya lebar
oh
ya ya
mm
oh ya ya ya

K
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one lah
so I think you can start first ah
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
ah kinaesthetic
ah kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility ah
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective lah
batman
can help others
but like for me is basically
oh so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
mm ah
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
harry potter there's this
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot lah what's the the magic spell
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing err port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish err irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
robert pattinson
ya that one
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers ah wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
ah if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
K but maybe
ah specifically to children ah because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard ah
like
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
I think also works for ah
adults ah
um but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
ya lah but
teleportation ah
but it saves time it's very quick
mm
ya ah but the thing is
you are saving time
teleportation
please lah don't cut me off lah the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this lah but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it lah ah
ya okay
so that's teleportation
err
um if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
ya
but money to me do it is not everything ah
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
ah your energy your smile and your
sorry occupational hazard K ah teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son aydin
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
wah you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
mm
mm
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited ah okay
orh
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective eh
work hard themselves
okay
mm
okay
err but I okay lah maybe for you kan
K
but I oh something came across my mind lah
ya I know it's just
a superpower
ya
mm
showing
the other side of ya
mm
okay
that's you were saying superpower
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
mm
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome lah
yes no the thing because I was thinking
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
ah
ah the bull's eye of medicine ah ah
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
but also
subsidised
subsidised
then that one you have to talk to the experts ah
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
ah not everyone
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
okay so
eh so that's about superpower lah
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
ah
or because I can
that is just lah
mm wonder woman eh
is okay wonder
okay can I I I will start with wonder woman woman wonder woman is
ya
ya lah
so but she can do oh she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
about wonder
orh
okay
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
oh it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why I do not know
so the villain made the clone
eh then that's boring man
eh but they are supposed to
people view online lah
ya there's ah people be ya video on demand
people view
no not apple lah then only apple people
only iMac
mm something like Netflix ah
extra lah then technology is already so fast pace
but is it

movie korean ya alive and zombie though
like
wah
how
as in like they don't
oh I know okay
maybe
mm
mm
aiya
mm
okay
like ridiculous ah
mm
ya lah but
ah
because of time
mm
but you must understand my my feel
okay the thing is I told you already kan
runs very fast
no the thing is the details
if I want to know
I will read about it
ya or I will go back
like you know I have a lot of things to do
like
ya lah
and
uh
so that is my stand on why I'd like to fast forward
superpower okay
oh now what's what superhero is it
what superhero
burdensome

mm
mm batman eh

ya lah
ya but that is like a whole other universe a whole other topic
ah
mm
okay
and
huh no
as in like
this is like life's basic
ya lah
ah
ya
superheroes everyone is a superhero in their own way

okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap eh
the first one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
to eat
then I'm like huh
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
it depends ah maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
mee goreng but you know me and mee goreng
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that mee goreng taste
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not lah
which I don't think it is
this is actually konjac jelly konjac you know C O N J A C
ah have you tried mala before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of mala cause actually I I went to hai di lao we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to hai di lao and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all lah
uh because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try mala they so bad you know like you have to try mala I was like what this this this big deal about mala sia everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too kaw
you know kaw
yes
like too strong like that
uh
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil lah
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you ah
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K nah
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
ya err okay K ya ya uh it so it's konjac jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this mala taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious eh
you think the conversation is good
like
mm
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets ah the other two is for my other friend
so I brought it home first
uh uh
you can just throw it away
because
stingy ah
mm
mmhmm
um
ah okay okay so
was it yesterday that I was working
so the day before yesterday
bump into this one man ah he we were walking
or like whatever lah I I don't think that was like the specific
and then
um he give you his card
and that card is a black card
okay is it his link card is black colour so no no no no no
credit card
like he bump into you so you ask for for compensation I think and then what will you do with the money
so what would you do with the money
if you were to have ah
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
babe
license doesn't
equal to one hour
mmhmm
mm
mm
okay now I
nevermind
oh I was thinking
because I want to get rich
so I was thinking I got the black card then I'm like I'm going to buy
the whole of ion building including residences
like each and every one of the residences and the whole ion
shopping centre itself
mmhmm everything
and then done ah for one hour I just like
just buy the whole building
cause from there you can circulate your money what so you can collect rent from like
cause this whole building is mine what
I can just like okay you all can fuck off
and this is the prime area oh
you all can F oh no no no no no you all can leave
and then I'll just like ya
eh you you see
see so clean
is it still stinging
like you are sleeping then you burp like oh my god I don't know why but lately
yes as ya it's super bad
I don't why it's getting worse now eh
I think it's cause I'm getting fatter
mm
ya that's why you can just buy one building only what
and then the money will rill on from there it's not cheap hello
rental can cost up like like thousands of dollars
and then from there then I can like what
I just be like one time buy the whole building ah
then I can buy off other stuff already what like from the money that I get from there
I buy another building or whatever lah from the money I can get then I can like what buy car

do you want me to spoil for you
do you want it you're asking for it you dying for it
get off my back ya
uh actually
the series makes the thing much more alive
ya I think every idea
from now onwards like if you make it into a book it's fantastic it's good the idea is there the layout the foundation is there
but then to make it live that's like better
it is of of course it's like believable lah ya the whole fantasy is believable
because it's like you can see yes exactly it's a very visual
but it's a lot of work actually
ya he's just playing it out
he's the original zigzagoon
he's the original raccoon that's why the sister like that
mmhmm
ya like a bunch of people right like gossip girl is everyone
but that's what happened in the end what oh

love island
err
there is this show about
I just watch actually the other day um
the other lady
mm
they adopt adopt children
did you watch that
no you have to watch it I think
it's like too fast
but towards the ends ah very very actually very sweet
I don't know why I force myself to watch that
I'm like literally sitting down waiting to go to work then in the end I went to work late plus I was watching this
I don't know
oh eh when is your exams ah
mm how is school
what do you mean by normal
eh speaking of which
actually I have school sorry if I'm like cutting you off
I know I'm like a tricksy
I'm just going to take you out ah
K I have a diploma in mass comm
degree in business marketing
in building drafting which is architecture
so I'm like
one thing to the other to the other
and then now I was thinking
about psychology a lot lately because initially I wanted to take that but
it wasn't safe lah but like now lately with all the mental stress
diploma in psychology and
ya I don't know lah I was just thinking a lot about it ah I don't uh it's been about two months already
why do you feel like certain way
at a certain time
um
more of a selfish thing I want to know about myself not only that
but I want to
I want to know why people react in a way ah
because I see people change and I see
like
like after a while you be like eh a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID
mm everyone is so wary dodgy now
sus yes sus
sus suspicions
what do you think what should I
err ya
ya have to really think about it ya cause you invest in time as well
mm
ya no no because the thing is because of this whole economic downturn
K yes I was in exhibition line
K it's getting a bit too personal already
I thought of like changing
changing the career line lah
changing the career and instead of
this whole cause the whole of uh the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it lah
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm of course ah but I'm just thinking like
it's more of a personal thing to be to be honest it's more of a personal I want to know why people act such way and
not only people but myself also lah
mmhmm
no like just diploma first
of course
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
because if you are talking about money yes I'm I have the job base
it's paying okay
just okay
and plus I can always pay pay installment yes malay people like installment
this is going to be
but no no uh of course obviously it's like school fees you pay installment what so
not that I don't want to move back with you guys but I'm so comfortable staying alone
mmhmm
mmhmm
yes on top of that you have add the the fact that you have to spare your time
yes I get that what the hell is this
wet tissue face mask
ah listen you are already what
nineteen bitch
I said bitch
why
won't it be exciting
treat it as a hobby lah instead
can
ya I know I know yes I like to be driven as well I don't like to drive people but the whole idea of like getting a license is like interesting
which will have to carry on
to the next topic
which I think would be fantastic
holidays

after this whole shi bang bang
what about the
mmhmm

mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya okay that one is a bit too touchy already but anyways
if given a choice
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
no because I've
I have travel all across europe not all across lah like maybe the western eh no eastern side of europe I remember it cheaper
like above
what was that the
the know not not not not not I won't said poor lah but that ya ya the eastern side of europe we should have a poor countries of europe everything there is cheaper right above france
ya not in france itself but ya the it is uh ya eastern side of europe
things are cheaper there
cause I was speaking to someone just now and then he was like
ya it's cheaper there but I haven't been there so I took the euro rail
ish ya
ya
mmhmm after conversion ah
so you like you hop on hop off like anytime you want that kind of thing
so I went from all the way from
a train ride all the way down to sicily france everywhere ah basically almost everywhere
mmhmm
mmhmm

no I was thinking like you go europe straight because I've been to europe then I want now I feel like
I need you to experience this with me I want to experience it again but I need someone which is like you to experience it with me
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
you know sya right

I didn't realize that about her but anyways
that's I envy her lah
I love her whole approach to life
exactly exactly which we can't I mean
it's ya
yes
inshallah
exactly like I read that post on the instagram they were like the grass isn't always greener on the other side
the grass is always green when you water it
I was actually thinking about doing uh restart no
gardening oh no speaking of hobby K nevermind

um I started playing stocks again
I thought of
I I followed this one guy he is american
so um muslim
but very americanized ah so is I don't know whether is how halal is it ah which is apparently is uh
everyone muslim is following him ah
so everyone muslim is doing the stock then I was like eh this whole stock is not really halal you know
but anyway so I'm just going to see how it goes
ah ya speaking of which um hobby yes
sewing I thought of getting a sewing machine
like soon
I actually plan to go down to gain or like gain city or challenger
I want to start stitching my own clothes
ya
ya lah this deconstruct lah like you exactly like that shirt
so maybe I can have like I this deconstruct one shirt
then I take tear off all the seams and then just cut off a pattern
you know pattern you can just uh oh paper pattern
ah that that brown paper kan
ah
just draw over or I don't even need to deconstruct I can just paper pattern
then I just ya trace trace trace
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya ya I I I'll start with oversize ah everything oversize so whatever I'm wearing suppose to be it's going not suppose is going to be oversized I want to do pants

it's a course
ya lah I mean like you can always note it out
mmhmm mmhmm
wait you have to use tools
like hitting tools
plier
uh huh uh huh
eh you know what I can incorporate you know why cause I was actually thinking of you know
um okay I saw that fashion show where they were doing like
those headpieces
with those beads pearls laces
I was actually thinking of incorporating that
into making a mask
you know the face mask that we are wearing
cause like everyone's wearing a normal
normal mask the most fanciest one is they buy from like
carousell whatever
uh ya very lame and cheap and always the same design
I thought of creating something that is like stand out
yes with beads lace
and then maybe can incorporate your methodology
or like earring whatever not not really earring lah but like maybe like some
metal pieces that you can stick you saw raja
the one the mouthpiece that raja wore the
that cover the whole face but leave out the eyes like catwoman like that kan cool kan
uh ya I thought of doing that
shall we
okay yes you and your exams when's your exam ending
mmhmm
are you the only december baby

no I was thinking about greens no no nope no no no no no
it doesn't it doesn't make sense to fight a lot
or like you can ride it like a horse

I was like ya allah ya rabbi
I know but I was like brother
I know that I am yes I am sassy
but
the patience is really wearing thin
I think it's because of the numbers ah
how
mmhmm
ya
any hotel lah with a good bathtub
a really good bathtub
no lah not okay ya now I'm thinking of it I should actually just go to a spa right
no ya actually thinking of it ya actually should just take the spa
ya I want to ya as much as I want to be pampered but I don't like
I was like screaming ah ah ah ah then he was like oi I haven't even touch you yet
ya exactly
you know what I think it's because
I think it's because of
childhood
over the smallest thing is it feels like torture right
ee
serious serious serious serious
then you know how my size is so big that everyone thinks that I'm cuddly
like oh I want to hug I say you better get away I will smack you then you know
no I just want to get in a bathtub that's all
okay I have a pool upstairs

new year's new york
this year how it really change eh
mm
ya next year should
come my friend is sell trying to sell me something
some E commerce thing
really right like it feels like yesterday but it's actually a long time ago it's actually
know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
no not twenty twenty is really slow walk ah but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location ah in the end we loved it ah
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop ah
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like um sya was
that's why a lot of things happened
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three people start queuing already
ya which is
too far they were cordoned off already
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
so I went down at about
ten no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten I was like eh the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like oh shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like huh
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
and it costs five hundred I thought I told you before
mm
it costs five hundred so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
carpet eh seriously I need to change this carpet
mmhmm
see
alhamdulillah
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity
yes manifestation of positivity and who pushed you
who went around
excuse me he died a long time ago
ya he did what
exactly a long time ago what
yes samled
mister samled
he passed away he's a good boy
codeswitching
like towards the end I never expected eh
ya
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
he's been forever kan
since you were like four or five
ya four or five ah
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain orh
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during
remember
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
or like walk around and do my work here or like
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
everyone needs the money
but
seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
mmhmm
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
mmhmm
uh huh
shouldn't be that expensive what to entice people to buy what or like rent
downgrade
decrease
mmhmm
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small lah
a false wall
then like I'm like huh
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this ah
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like oh I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like ah okay no way
but it's costly lah
it's nice sia it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all kan with the window
oh ya speaking of which just now I pass by uh river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like oh my god I really miss that place
I really miss that place
huh I miss the outside I was like walking through the whole thing
ah that
I love the outside I hated my room
it's like porter room so small
river valley
wait where you which one you talking about
potong pasir
no
potong pasir yes
potong pasir I love the room because it was an upgrade
they clean once in a while it was nice
the room is nonsense but the hall is huge and I'll always sleep slept at the hall
yes
hmm
huh when
she cook curry
mm
huh then where was I
oh interesting
exactly exactly plus the hall was already so huge
so the windows made it look huger
look bigger huger you know make it look
bigger
ya if only the rent there is cheap
yes it's considerably expensive ya of course for myself
no no no no no no no no no rent a proper room this uh this time round lah but it's still expensive now is too expensive
it's like almost two thousand dollars
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like uh
eh no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
mm
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right

okay can
oh serious
okay lah then tell mama cannot lah if she want then can go to sentosa or something
that will be nice ah
ah
the laser tag thingy right
ya coming into december then my parents think about renovation for their house and the renovation is a little bit of a nightmare
not because of the tau but because of the house itself you want me tell you the story

okay lah some aeroplane food is nice
qatar flight food is quite shiok
right so like when the flight come like the flight to singapore come so only those who are from that island be at the airport cause to okay lah then the singaporeans can go to that island then it helps their economy it sustained from also

I don't have qatar membership I only have a brother
he was in adelaide brisbane then singapore indonesia it's like eh I thought COVID period you still flying around

the err primary school
I don't know I don't keep track also err too confusing the kid is at primary four or primary five I think
actually I don't ah I don't join teaching because I don't want to be under also
that's why I do adjunct
ya the stress I think my friends you know in teaching career okay lah actually the the reason why I don't join teaching is because I want my holidays lah
no I want my holidays during off peak period
mm
kindergarten
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours one also
ya
yes last resort mm
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment kan so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing lah but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
mm
oh maybe I just don't handle stress well
ah like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second one so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that one I you know lah
they have been trained
ya amazing

the world of the marriage
ya I did but I watched halfway only
cause so draggy so boring
I feel like they could have just settled it within like the first five episodes but they drag it all the way
no lah I watched until the end lah eh no I watched until almost the end
but I think I stopped like
I've got like three episodes to go I think
why
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya lah like draggy right
ya ya the new wife also psycho
so that's why I only watch I skip until the last episode then I saw the last episode
the new wife left the husband right
ya lah because she fell for the psychiatrist right
she fell for the psychiatrist right the colleague
I I think the guy like her that's quite obvious what
uh huh
oh is it
mm
oh is it I didn't see that part though I think that's where I skip
mmhmm
I feel like they could have finished in ten episodes
because it's so draggy
ya
the what they ask for is system set the standard ah the standard ya no the standard lah because like if you see
on average most of the dramas are sixty episodes what
locked can you please lock the door
like the story line lah
ya ya I got bored I didn't even want to finish it
ya I still prefer the old dramas like what I'm re-watching the princess hours
did you put that
no I watched there's a few versions right
I think I watched the nineteen ninety seven eh
ya I don't know ah that one also I never finish
it's very rare for me to actually finish a drama I get I get easily bored
no I'm not it's not about being busy it's I just
no I will like I tend to switch over very often
ya but I keep re-watching like
I don't know I find comfort in watching old drama that I've like watched a thousand times before
ya full house also remember
the rain rain right the actor
that was good
mmhmm
ya the other day right I went to the clinic at choa chu kang
but then at the same time because the doctor was very nice so I ask him lah like if he deal with
which contains like vitamin A or something ah I forgot what he said current sixty plus
but then the thing is I googled right website they handle err severe cases
mmhmm cystic acne
oh that one I don't know
ya
so they referred her
but how's the payment like ah I'm on I'm on tight budget seh
but they they only accept cash ah they don't accept like medicine or what
ya but but you don't
you should
you should wash you should use Cetaphil
the exfoliator
why
ya
but this one also is because
of last weekend
cause I didn't hydrate myself after drinking
is this one is cystic acne then after that it exploded but the ones on my forehead it didn't
ya lah
but I also but it's because of period
but my forehead I really don't know
then
then you want me to get married to fix this

and I also like the event was like fun I just had like I had a really good time that day that day ya I mean there's like three places I've went one is like oma spoon

ya and also like
I thought it will be like twenty dollars or fifteen dollar for just a waffle like waffle like sometimes
no but like I went to like haji lane before then

no it's not it's near
I forgot what is it called farrer road farrer park is like near the blue line there I don't know what but you have to walk for seven minutes

around there is like factory something like that ah like it's not like

they won't they might cut off by then
cause like my intern company we had like err like two different banks or insurance then
okay lah at least like big big companies big big clients means good good for the company we are
kind stable but like my other friends who were interning they had their pay cuts so that was quite sad
it I mean it was honestly it was like lower than that was so sad ya five hundred
but why okay I I shall not comment why
eight hundred I
I don't get it

ya like I never heard that name before so unique ya lah ya
what if
eh what ah
ya means can give full bottle already lah
I don't know because because only until six months you can give milk then after six months you can give food already
ya
ya but the thing is that then like this one is I don't know
ya how eh when to increase milk
too much I don't know
you see when should I increase my baby ounce ounce is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can eh as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty ah
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can ah
ya
huh

so
ya lah
punggol punggol
I don't know like how many like
you know quota something like that lah but apparently
he
I'm not so sure I think what I I have a feeling probably it's an english school or what lah I never I heard lah I forget to ask what's the
the name of the school
ya
uh huh
yup
oh
okay wait for the place okay
okay okay okay I just now this err today lunch I ate at jurong point do you know that jurong point there is like a japanese kind of like halal place do you know
ya ya ya no no no no it was at err along this err
the swensen's all that lah that was that
I don't know
probably I think so ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
we we finished already we finished eating so we just pass by there
err
ya he just she's not into that kind of food lah I I think so lah
eh three daughters
like the the eldest one is like what twenty three twenty four like that
so ya lah
that's that
tomorrow err tomorrow tomorrow
uh
oh then after that the ya
then no after that no more already lah right
ya
okay okay okay
okay we see how aiya ilan madrasah
slippers you mean
mm
mm ya
oh okay
ah okay lah
okay
oo ya
oh
ya talking about her ah
oo that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story ah because err
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing lah but the timing is also like err odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish ah
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early lah but sometimes
ah they go off or sometimes
when you work late ah you have to finish late lah you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back ah
not that bad ah
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back lah right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off ah something like that or
something like that lah alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is err I think
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish ah
err I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know lah and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early lah to finish
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
then she oh then this one ah I will ask sani to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear ah kan
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out ah then after that she like go out ah then she like alamak aiya I like I also don't want ah to be leader you know
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything lah kan
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this one because they are like contract ah
ya contract not staff
you can you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this lah you put in extra hours lah you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing lah it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like err worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
ah ya
ya
ya ya ya
so the thing is like she's not supposed to know
like like like for example ya I want to quit ah and then if like okay you quit okay then who want to take over you ah hani ah hani can and
ah ya I know I know ya
so weird right probably
then like err
probably ya
ya ya ya
that's why so it's ya that's what the thing is
mm mm mm
yup maybe we should go there
art ground also ya
oh then you better check lah
mm hmm
eh
mm is it
ya ya ya ya
who who who just said ah I remember one of the maid does that
where is it ya
yulis do that can't remember lah that maid do that
so anyhow ya
oh I don't know no no ya okay wait
uh ya ya ya
kan
oh
you you you
know he has been sleeping late because ya every ya every night I come back
uh the light will be on not how
so I just
okay
okay
eh
so ya so probably what the art ground so think lunch at home lah ya probably lunch at home
I don't know that
oo okay
discovered ah
so I no no more already ah I did I did buy something like for myself some potato chips I think potato chips yes
then there is chocolate also we got chocolate right
snickers at the end I never I haven't tried
um
no
mm hmm
need to book what where where where where's that
where's the place ah jurong west ah
jurong west where
I don't know I don't know
I don't know lah seriously
group ah
like you call yourself like oh what from the ex black hole
if if I'm black hole I will sue them man
oh is it but I just I just find it weird lah
because it's it's like my brands lah
okay you you want to advertise ya I I I think I have to be upfront about it lah
like you don't use my brand ah
like say eh I'm from err Adidas like that one Nike you know
ex Adidas err it just logo right basis like shoes right
ya but but I think it's just because our context like singapore is too small I say it's like ah
I say like I'm I'm ex you know
I don't know I just I think like he
I just feel it like it
come from like you you leave me and you you open up the same thing as me you get what I mean not
so it's like I I leave
my
agency and I set up another agency but I still leverage on err that agency's name I think it's just
if you open up something else probably lah but I don't know
ya but you took to advertise I don't know
advertisement ah like you know right it's ah
if I if you are like the owner how how do you feel
ya ya where were you from oh I used to work here okay lah
it feel like advertise herself as that is the header lah
I'm from like ex ah
okay
I I think it's it's maybe not right lah
ya
ya so so many things err
ya
okay
okay
okay
oh
ya
oh
oh
the
okay
then his shoes his black shoes how ah
this one this shoes also quite new ah I don't know whether want to sell whether want to
then you sell and buy another shoes the one that the friend gave you know
right
never use lah that shoes
ask him to use but I think that that his black shoes still can use eh
but I I ask him to eh never wear this shoes what he says what
ya according to him lah I don't know
ya
oh that day got one somebody enquire about the
the japanese shoes you say you want twenty bucks then I say thirty bucks
then I say like thirty bucks lah you want I say oh I need to try I say come lah you come and try lor
then no answer already
so ya
mm
ya but I've been keeping it and not wearing it also so it's
no because the thing is to be honest the shoe is quiet big for me ah
I think bought err like
so I'm wearing err a nine point five but that one was a ten
eh
big big because different ah I think the cutting different certain shoes like like my Jordan I'm wearing nine but certain shoes I wear nine and a half
but
what I do right now buy shoes online right I would like go and try first
try first and after that
ya try
so this is my first time lah
okay
yes
still recording
oh okay so it's like
oh okay so it's like half an hour ah

next time I'll
proper goods then you can
yup
no no giveaway giveaway

one I got two soccer boots ah why I want to keep it like
ya
so ya lah
see how
the sandal also there's a sandal at the two kids err
ya see whether can
soccer boots soccer boots
actually can
can but I don't know that one is it's
right
what ten dollars
ya the soccer boots you should lah
err
ya because the thing is when I buy it's also second hand
so I don't know better
ya but I bought it second hand
that one I bought in so I don't know whether this one
authentic or not authentic so I really don't know really
because I went to the cobbler bukit maju right
then he say eh eh actually I got another shop at just wanna try it on
then I say eh okay try
I have two boots
I fix one boot then I buy another boot why ah
so I don't know why ah

ya so that's that's the thing
so ya lor
then um ya
okay so how how how is ilya the that you ask him to write

we're having task here and there I I don't know I'm just I'm going to put aside first lah
no he he ya lah he meant that way but I don't know if he wants me to sell it he got the profit of it or he just giving it to me
uh
the
email right
not yet
nope no emails yet
not yet
it's not yet lah I think sooner probably I think maybe waiting for teachers
no they asking about you but okay lah
you all go and make your own plans lah we make plans
and after that we still need dessert and we still need coffee is they got so many things to talk about
you lah
what's yours
must be the crumbs lah don't know how many time we must wipe the table
kids
it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time
is it end of the year thing is it
I I expect you to go to the one at bugis the bigger one
ah that's
hospital
then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
oo that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government
eh
you have to wait equipment first ah
oo I thought they pay for you
who
huh you know you have a friend but you don't know who
oo
oo
you saw him or he told you are
oo
what you mean they have different different team eh
err
okay lah think can you can make it lah
ya lah
lah whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first lah while waiting for something that you used to do
lah
later the zoom
you do alone eh I I don't need to join you okay
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
the first to teach err tasha
get the malay students to love
malay
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
so that's why I think it's a great loss err and she's there I think according to tasha it's like what she's only there for three years
so tasha was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one lah
uh
tasha is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
tasha is the first batch she teach three years lah
three years eh five years
ya initially tasha doesn't like her what
but in the end
a'ah see
her class what
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is nadia she pick and choose
it will affect her this what I notice ah
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around lah
because I think
tasha tasha also what
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
which now you don't expect her to dance lah she's got no interest already
nadia my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that oo tag rugby
oo touch rugby tag rugby
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego ah the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active lah she is like she is active since young so
she's daring lah she she has the confidence
can lah let her try lah
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store lah tasha tasha hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs lah
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set what knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay lah
it belongs to tasha or belongs to her
then it should be able to lah and tasha use
should be lah it's kids size what
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
eh she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
err going bishan on friday
I need to pass my sister all her stuff
going bedok saturday eh
I know that's why she said come on saturday because she's not going to jurong so everybody's there
sunday is a brothers in law second marriage
eh
they detect eh this saturday wow it's handy
so fast
oh ah
I need to do my report soon
no you soon
you get better
eh today's is what
nineteen
today is nineteen see
I'm not working I still can get the dates right
I buy something lah
later you get tasha to I think we have nuggets hashbrown finish
fries finish
nuggets only then maybe if you want desperate lah
the boys yesterday refuse they took only coco crunch I think they finished up the whole batch ah
the whole box
try try not to give so much ah they're coughing
haris haris haris coughing
so I'm not worried they drink a lot of plain water and when they cough they look for water which is good
very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you lah see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast lah
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway lah but she haven't message me
peck seah P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start err preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time lah the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind ah if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
but they have they have tuition what
amirah's err siblings they have tuition
ah
I thought amirah go for err oo visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
uh but math class
my only worry is nadia's math I mean ya now she's average ah but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is tasha cannot help much also with maths
at least science
err english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind lah
at least if we start her early because we started tasha like only in P five
right started tasha with five
hmm
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as tasha
ya she did
okay lah
together
oo
K
um
yup can
god
received the message eh the email tau
ah
because I only have class dojo
class dojo is like only
apa
find it weird
duchess soon I think double lah when they send you parents gateway then I also got it on class dojo
mister po everytime I receive message we said oh
so that's why I ask her wait your your teacher never eh set one set two same so I don't know where set three is
other classes because of subject bending
mm
they try to natasha nadia also don't have any changes
eh but I don't know lah eh
hmm
three and four together correct sorry

right
can
oh okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
your wedding date will be available then um you can
choose
eh I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically err when you
what's that called where he lives is also err stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just um
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance lah ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
oh then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is ah amendment there is ah basically um when you choose err your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things ah
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to lina everything kan send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire um all the details so that err being a typical singaporean ah we kiasu one so err once err once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
ya is it ten is it oh okay
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller lah basically
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay ah
that's one thing also but
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that lah but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
cause okay
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like err like they're they're very busy lah so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
so included me and alina
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different lah
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday ah you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you oh close the window
ya things like that lah but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
um
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot lah ya but for me it was I chose the eh no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
um ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different ah mm different ah
wah I don't remember whether there's any charges eh
okay okay
don't need one not necessary ah they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
like what is um it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
ya so I told them err I I've got work lah they will they will still will pressure you then oh but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
ya so then you have
you can ask the mother
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
but that word everybody thinks that oh it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end what ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch oh now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point kan
mm dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say err like
it it defeat to me lah it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it lah like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends lah ya so
all weddings there will be time time time delay
really
ceremony there will start at one thirty
then she's like I think we should move off now
kan then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing lah cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding eh eleven thirty she said we should move off now
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location what how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully lah it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live err a chendol station ah everything like in the mosque everything lah quite quite nice lah he paid for everything
then ya lor then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is um itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
for me lah is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible lah in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
yes transportation is is the problem to me ah that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
how no no no no yes they their eh they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way lah you know that they want to save your money and
different person different lor ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing ah they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
err I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at bedok reservoir
ya
ya
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to dewi
like for me I leave it to alina like for me I leave it to alina on how you want to to but the thing is like alina also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research mah
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like eh I cannot be splitting it right down the middle ah right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like eh our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like eh I want fifty dollar my problem lah
I pay myself what that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have err chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that lah ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
mm salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
um
mm
mm
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding err expo and everything kan so it's a bit different ah
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography ah ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing lah ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
mmhmm can do that also
err I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place lah if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled lah I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
mm can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us lah
ya it is quite nice also over there um on the wedding day itself lah ya
as in your wedding day lah I want to book the indigo room over there oh no need lah ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points oh no need lah no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel mm no need no need no need
um
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well lah I would say err okay so basically
you have to see
mm yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and alina did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
wah she the that that that girl is amazing ah ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
but
ya it's all it's all my cousins lor all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early kan ya
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues lah basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about err the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important lah
we didn't walk in
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
ya
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
I was like
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
things like that lah
okay
mmhmm I would say you don't need to worry about the activity ah people will just take picture with you lah
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing eh no one no one cares lah
my the recent one with my with my err sister in law's brother we did at err malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
ya no problem lah
no need lah okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know oh but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
no but the two weddings I been to also
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's wah you got a lot money
to me lah personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me lah personally
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements what
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
yes
yup we we make our own lah um cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early lah cause it's it's not fast job mah
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like wow
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
err my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
mm but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know one when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very kiasu game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like alina throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be what then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes ah and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks lah the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important lor
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right um
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff lah I would say but I like him because err he listens to what I say
ah then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional lah he listens to me lah ya
yup ya so I just walk around ah I told him to follow me ya no lah I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked lina to go inside then she like
I don't know wedding then she okay no need ah ya

okay
err
thank you so much okay so um
uh are you studying now are you working tell us more
okay anything else
okay
okay that's great ah okay
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
okay
it's it's not a definite shape I can say ah it's not a definite shape it's not a it's not a a shape that is
is precise or ah specific is
it could either be a it it could be it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
unique
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
a few types of mango
and yeah
I agree like I don't know I've never tried the red one but
if given the chance I would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite my favourite fruit
so ya moving on err
nah when like I don't know supermarket
err
err hangs around the station
like late at night
so
okay thank you so much
uh ya exactly like I mean uh
in singapore it's it's a very common fruit to find
um
and as products they they come in varieties a variety of products
what do you think
mmhmm mmhmm
err
beauty products so
okay in other forms of food
like like my sister said it's err
for me it does makes me feel happy
err
mango tea kan
dessert
exactly cause
it's
yellow
and
it just draws
err mango bingsu
err
perfect
sunshine eh
um
it's like a brand
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a uh err a fruit name for a brand because
uh they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all lah because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
I guess
that's interesting
okay
I feel like
mango cake is something that you would find easily
hmm
exactly
exactly I feel that
sure I mean uh that whatever that she said was right because I feel that
we don't really think about
oh my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs ah we there's also
they sometimes have that and mango pudding
pudding kan
like
it's amazing how how much I love mango pudding
process
that's true
about having mango soda
do you have have you had any mango sodas
okay
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking kan um
actually durian I don't know if you guys know durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about um
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
okay
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
and
I think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
ya I don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
it's way before all of us
and there are a hundred types of mango
each with a unique taste shape
so
okay this fruit is not only delicious but boasts
it's actually quite true cause
that
okay the fact that it has it's sweet
eating snacks that is high in sugar you know like
it's
I don't know it's
it could be replaced with just eating mango which is amazing
mango and its nutrients to health benefits
uh it's a good news right because we love eating mango so much
that uh
we know that it has its health benefits
like ya uh such as improved immunity okay that's one of the benefits
wow that's really interesting
protein about
uh vitamin C sixty seven percent of
the reference daily intake
vitamin B six eleven point six percent of the
okay err vitamin A ten per cent of the vitamin E nine percent nine point seven percent of the
vitamin B five six point five percent of the
um honestly
I don't even know what all this means but I'm just reading it out as part of the conversation lah kan
err everyday we learn new things from this conversation
vitamin K okay err six percent of the I I don't know if I've already said that
niacin
five percent of the manganese four point five percent of the
calcium selenium and iron
wow interesting
okay
okay
err
when you
finally bought mangoes
just remember to keep them in a very cool place maybe
it's
mango ice cream
the higher two people gonna what do you also that's like our favourite ice cream flavour ever
that's like our favourite ice cream flavour ever
uh
food that you can have during
really really hot weather
like honestly
so because this is our first uh topic kan so
ya no high expectations I'm so sorry
but yes we're trying
okay
now that we uh we hit thirty two minutes let's err just
thank you for asking I know
so for my day I today I
for a month actually we have to be uh doing classes online
I mean
we're just talking we're just having a conversation just chilling
like
much as when you're outside
in school especially
I'm sure some of you would feel the same
quite decent for me
okay so
now that we've uh talked about our day
let's talk about okay before we going err we're going back to talking about the fruit lah eh cause
I don't know let's just talk about this it's more casual lah kan so okay err what eh what food did you have today
mm mm
so
then okay let's uh start talking about next thing shall we talk about fruits still or shall we move on to another topic
okay what uh which artist do you listen to the most
okay but
um I wouldn't say okay my favourite song
it
that's just what you feel about it
err I rarely talk about emotions so
it's weird that I'm talking about it now
okay so uh besides that err canon in D eh that's one genre that I don't listen all the time but that that's a song that I really really like above all the other songs that I hear
and okay
k-pop
they both have very distinct uh features they both have
ah I will never let you down by rita ora I think that song is very empowering
besides that okay I I also listen to spanish songs and
the the background music has this um hum
accordion and I don't know it's just it's just very
it's very cute like when you listen to the song you would think of being in the
feel and what not
okay because we're err recording at a very late time because my sister just got back from work so please
just
hold on we still have about twenty minutes left like less than twenty minutes left
everything is going great
err
I cannot name any of them I'm so sorry
we are actually from
or
that's very interesting uh
we'll have this uh genre thingy conversation in another recording lah eh
so ya
talk about it
sure sure sure but
it depends ah it doesn't have to be western but honestly my okay
that
the the one that tastes so good but you can only have that like once in a while as a treat
that's the that's the type of uh indonesian meatball soup that exist
in this region so we can find that easily in any parts of indonesia err
that's that's that's about it
I like to have that because I like my food to be hot
um if it's soupy I want something crunchy to go with it
so yeah
then my food that I would have once in a while as a treat would be
I would say err korean
and they really really
aww really nice friends shout out to them
ah interesting okay you go first
it's okay it's okay it's okay for talking too much oh great look we have ten more minutes okay so I'll just
uh share with you guys my celebrity err of my like whoever that I I idolize
err very quick uh it's getting hot because we cannot record with fan so let's
my favorite show
of all okay I have I have three of them
my favourite show I'm just going to name them
err first is err the good place
err starring kristen bell oh my god she's I just found out that she's also the voice actress for
err frozen I know it's really slow but
eh
yeah
honestly the ya that's the show that I always watch when I eat when I sleep when I shower
I'm kidding about the shower apart but sure if I can I'll do it
oh don't trust the ya don't trust the B
in apartment twenty three starring krysten ritter I think that's her name krysten ritter krysten ritter ya
that's her name she's really tall and she's really pretty
brooklyn nine nine oh my god my favourite actor is like all of them
okay but I adore specifically err stephanie beatriz
oh my god she is so strong
uh without her acting self eh
I know it's about bullies and what not and now now the situation with the police in the is actually quite sensitive lah it's actually very as if it's a sensitive issue to talk about
but uh this show is nothing like that
sure they have uh references based on true life events and what not but ya stephanie beatriz I love her so much
the fact that she can
because I I feel like the good show eh the sorry the good place is a show that is not easy to act in because
it's it involves okay ah
in general I think acting is just
a wonderful career okay I I cannot believe in singapore it's a non essential thing
people need their entertainment for all to live
yes that's really important this
it's not a hoax it's it's the truth mm
a lot of people are dying a lot of people have been dead from the virus so please be responsible and wear your masks people okay
and to wrap up err ya so
I think for every episode we'll just try to think of things to talk about
uh I'm sorry today like for the first trial video it's not
it's not the it's not the kind of topic that we get to talk about err eh sorry um what am I talking about I'm sorry that the first trial err recording is uh not
I don't know an idealistic
trial recording I have no idea what an idealistic trial recording is but ya I feel like we could have talked more about ourselves first
okay we have five minutes left I'm just going to talk about let's talk about ourselves lah okay
so err my full name is actually
err wahayu agustian but I have an english name it was given to me so
so err my my preferred
name that I always use is wesley agustian so people of a lot of people call me agus
and uh I study in NAFA I study in
diploma I I take I I'm taking diploma in arts management so I do a lot of uh
I do a lot of paperwork
I do a lot of research I do not much of a research yet but
I'm definitely going to do that soon
then yeah
uh I aspire to be actually I am very enthusiastic about languages I know about seven languages at least
no not at least
about seven languages so at least five I guess
indonesian actually like as my daily thing
but I'm also recently I think like in like I think four years five years back I've being trying to learn ah my regional languages which is
yeah
err okay the other languages will be mandarin
err but it's very basic conversational korean as well
so yeah
what about you
err introduce yourself uh anything we have three minutes huh
to use
okay so thank you so much for listening it's uh legit we're going to record for one hour like I mean we already record for one hour I don't know what I'm talking about
so ya err sorry that was a mumble err thank you so much err we hope that you don't cringe so much throughout the whole uh recording I mean it's fine if you do
so ya
err thank you so much we'll see you in the next recording do let us know if it's okay or not thank you so much

okay
so
hi
uh this is madir and this is my speaking partner zaini
um zaini say something
hi okay so let's look at the prompts um
ah
how are you today
okay
okay so let's
ah
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay lah that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
uh the
oh the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but uh it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow lah but
I suppose um ya
ya
okay
but
still at the back of my mind um
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect um you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult lah and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
uh
ha okay
ya
uh huh
uh huh
huh okay
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house ah
huh
ya ya what do think of the house ah
mmhmm
keep talking ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean for me ya lah I mean it's I do feel
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to kan like I mean like I've always been living in yishun
and then now moving to tampines so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me lah ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
mm
ya
ya lah
ya
uh okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions lah it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
uh huh
uh first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know uh really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand lah
and then the second
would be obviously
oh but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
hmm
mm
like would be health
um you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
uh and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
um
you know what I think I want to talk about our house
you know we started off from here
and it became like one
ya
ya
ya
not no what I'm saying is this is is is not that it is
if is small I mean it is
I would have imagined it to be slightly bigger but it is not
you know
no no no I just wanted to
the only lah but the buttons ge ge which is good lah
ya but it's okay it's not that bad
ya
ya honestly
I was kinda glad that the
me
I choose it
I wanted the the
are you sure
hmm
iran
yang paling digemari
you know it was an option that you know that I didn't even pick you picked it
you know and I thought it was just interesting you know because I've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like mm ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
ya ya ya ya ya that one was nice that was really really nice you know when we woke up in the morning and then
um we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
mm where they were that was really really very nice and then um
you know it was just interesting it's just that I think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went tehran
we didn't have a guide like what we had uh in isfahan and yazd
eh no no no we didn't have yazd it's shiraz sorry ya
but
ya lah we didn't have a guide lah
would have been nice lah if we had a guide ah but we didn't have a guide
ya
no the that point of time I was I wasn't I was freelancing so I had a lot of time
huh
ya ya he had a wedding to go to
okay so that was the most interesting trip
but what was the most memorable trip
but you went to bordeaux so many times
oh ya
mm
cranny
mmhmm
uh biarritz
no yes we did we went to biarritz we went to cannes
yes
then from bordeaux we went ya we went to uh dune du pilat
and then we went to biarritz
ya and then we went to arcachon ya
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
uh huh
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course lah it has to be attractive in my way lah
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
hmm and you know the person's kind of vibe ah not not not personality or character lah because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well ah
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
I'm about to really go deep
yes ya
yes
eh no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
soalan pertama fahamkan anda
no
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
mmhmm okay
why
uh huh
ah okay
uh huh
uh
um
design
uh
um
accounting
accounting
accounting ya
so that I can become an electrician so that I can fix my own things
you know
and I I think those three skills would be
most
uh would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question um
okay
uh
uh
uh talented
I have no idea what talented means uh is in in in malay um
uh
ya tom holland
mmhmm
ah
uh huh
actually
uh huh
okay um
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right um how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
um
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could um not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample um opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
um
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
um
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know uh make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree uh unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
and
ya
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
okay cleaning done wah
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
yes
ya
ah oh
we can go later we can go tomorrow
yup
okay so okay
ya
I kinda like it though
it kinda looks more like uh rustic to me
okay
actually kan
I was imagining the the counter top to be
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
eh thicker
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly ah
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
um
uh
I can eat that I think for every single meal
you know
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay
I love it so much in fact
ya
ya but back to our house I actually cannot believe that you know that this is going to be our place
just
you know the wall
actually I was thinking ah like dining area
or just this wall

on the floor lah of course lah with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that lah as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I were I I'm in that kind of mood
is it
mm
mm
mmhmm
that sounds fun
can consider
or the another one is this one also Ascott oh the price oh my god
actually the the last time I saw it is about five hundred plus
is a apartment also
mm
oh when are we receiving that ah
ya
because it's every tourist attraction place right
ya ya ya ya I think he will appreciate now at this age
oh ya hor
mm)(mm)(mm
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward lah but I think he
I think he don't mind
no eh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why ah why you don't like it
oh is it
what did you have
a a what
oh
mm okay lah I will decide
oh ya ya ya
mm
I also have it every month
on the itinerary
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that um indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
is like a bit weird lah so when I taste it eh I thought that it's going to be bad but then like oh my god it's so nice
err I ate the prawn green curry you the naan
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we uh we
mm it's too loud mm
because we we passed by and then after that we thought eh
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay lah
and then I don't really like udon
that's why maybe I don't mm
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
err okay lah I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like uh
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar tau for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
naan
okay lah it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay wow I I I don't ever have
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
mm mm mm
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm
ya
mm
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in bali remember the the Yoshinoya
the yakiniku beef
is it the same thing
ah
but then that one the one that I ate also called yakiniku beef why
oh wait
maybe maybe maybe
oh is it
mm
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose mee soto
oh okay
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know what
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like um
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it lah
of course right
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
oh but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity ah rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like oh my god oh my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the wayi can just like err can I
ya can I just like err take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
err helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room uh house is like seven million
err with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets err attached uh with uh indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
scary siol
I don't think I can
don't ah
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
ugh
mmhmm
and then they put there as a meme
okay oh ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
buy one get one free
oh you mean like okay okay I don't know
hmm
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
ah okay then that kind of deal like okay lah meh I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay lah maybe that one is a bit worse
like huh one for one
but I don't get to choose
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
standard lah
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body ah
ha
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like ugh
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like uh
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things lah maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
err
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients eh no no no uh like he or she is not wrong
and everything like that and then
ah I like like ya I like uh true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news oh I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are um
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
uh or like paranormal activity all these like
um uh cable uh ya
a good movie correct
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
err ya ya ya
ya
mm
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what ah
ah chris watts ah is it the chris watts
the one that she the one that the the
ya the one that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
um
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can uh on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay lah maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix one eh
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
uh I mean he's a narcissist what uh eventually he will just gonna act that oh no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
about two months prior prior to the wedding eh prior to the murder sorry
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
err the girlfriend lah but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious lah
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like um
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle lah like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like uh grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the one that
I had after I had
aryan after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
uh healthy okay lah healthy is subjective lah
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
this
take care of you when you are young kan so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
err they need I have to
do it
for them
ah and then my third wish actually
uh I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still uh I'm already pretty
oh I
err when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
err uh um lower secondary
then I think
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head kan I will actually really think like then I was like eh like quite sad lah like
they are somebody's
err
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya
ya and then after that you are at the risk also because maybe you know
so it's quite sad lah
ya
you have any wishes
ya man
ya man
because my my
you think what
that's why why is he even the president
oi
baby love
no more new K says
ya
at sembawang
mmhmm
so could you
huh
who
oh is it
wait your workplace got intern
like
and the community centre
ya they actually intern
what what do the intern do what what course is he from
why you met you gift
ha
okay ya
ya
ya I mean why you do you want to be there for your intership like what would you gain or
what could you possibly not learn from before that you know at school
that's weird
hmm
ah
there's there's
is it the same as our here is that how you all sit at
mm
mm
mm
to um
mm
mm
they just go there to like see whether like oh like everything like ah okay I go lah and ask
mm
they'll go
oh is it
mm mm mm mm
to
ya
then you turn around then you see that eh you know like
um
huh
ya
it's not at can I take it out
huh
you go ah
ya
then you call in then you should call in to first and ask what what what they can do
you know like say help aryan aryan
correct correct you can definitely uh look up
unless if you cannot find whatever that you're you you want to know online then no choice ah you need to go down what
and then if your mum
you know like cannot go down you go down first lah like check it out for her what's the problem
that some some people just think that we actually don't want to help them
you know because like we want to do the easy way out
but actually we really cannot help
don't want change colour
ah
oh okay
mm
huh
nothing to do with race what
eww aryan
but that time you say you want interview right
eh
Ministry of Manpower
for
wait what sorry for the that what position
oh
what what what what will you do if you get the job like what will you do
dormitory
ah okay okay
mm mm mm mm mm
why
oh is it
but then the pay is is the same ah
as
that one higher ah
november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
err actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation lor
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya lah I pass
so
you know that day I went for uh a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
and white lodge is um
it's a private uh institution
ya it's a private err it's a private school lah it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's uh it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge um
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in ah okay like the the one I went I went uh from eight thirty to one
I have to err assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates lah but they are they are like
one teacher err to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then um
after that the okay so what I did was like uh
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
um I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children lah um okay the first half the eight thirty to
um
for kids that uh the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
ang moh
and then mixed race like japanese and ang moh
like um japanese and japanese korean and uh sweden
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local one
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international uh so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
orh ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
eight thirty to five lah
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because uh if you go under government
saturday you're uh open half day
then you need to alternate working ah
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this one like saturday sunday you are closed and then what I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower lah
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see uh what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
colourful
colourful characters lah like
err and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the uh
they call me they call me miss
hu
because they don't my my name is very long right then like uh okay never mind uh just okay just call me miss hu
okay then after that they
oh got one kid say uh miss hu can I go to the toilet please
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
um can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like whoa eh
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
go to school on that day right
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so ah
a'ah
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this uh one um one
uh no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
uh one kid is err
ya
half german half japanese so
um
tell us like okay uh
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like uh and then the kids will like orh then they will uh
uh
attempt to attempt to say the language also lah
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because uh the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys lah girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their naptime uh they uh then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
mm
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already dah
feed breakfast lah
they have like a snack lah like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that uh doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one kan
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later lah
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
err when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring lah
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no uh you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like oh my god uh and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before

so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
uh it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
ah kids also starting school soon
um
when
march eh eh march april
I I think so
because uh now I think the cases in singapore is more or less quite stabilised
and uh we are in phase three
and I think some of the regulation and uh rules like uh have lax a bit lah
so I think they would allow us to do to uh the visiting this year what do you think
ya I think so too probably uh direct relative
and
ya
I don't know the the government haven't
ya issue any notice yet about
celebration
the thing you have been doing uh quite a bit of research these past few days and I've been
reviewing your proposal
so we can can consider some of uh the ideas that
we share in the WhatsApp
WhatsApp group
so I ya I think we should we should err you know
find some I uh
find the to get some quotation
what is err
what is your uh your your ideas for the renovation
uh minimalist
oh I
uh
I think open concept I I I'm okay with the open concept
uh
ah
you are my uh private
cook
ya uh I will buy all the ingredient
and then uh I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter um
you want a you want to put like a uh you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
uh the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because ah ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better lah because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and uh moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food lah
ya
and then
ya
uh
to to uh depends on uh
mm
kan ah
mm ya I I think you you think that concept
err I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack uh uh the what you call that the the wall there
err
and then you uh you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
oh okay lah
ya lah
you think because uh Facebook and have been
spying spying on your on your your search
so I think
what what you are searching
they they know what you are searching so they are trying to match what you are searching
right
ya ya I think
the uh ya ya can
can can be done can be done
so
mm
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
uh multiple attempt to
uh kill them
they uh they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
uh it uh spraying the the lizard repellents uh spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too lah the our our house here I think
uh the it's there's a lot of uh lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient ah even though I've tried to to to hit them ah is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
oh my god so uh I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
ah
err
ya
ya
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time lah it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners uh I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity lah it's a it's a need lah more of a need
necessity because everything has err you know
wears down you know
and uh our our kitchen looks quite dirty and uh rundown and uh
our our the uh you call it the flooring starts to uh wears down
ah ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and uh they feature a few uh lah but uh so far three D contractors uh in terms of
the the the outcome ah it it it suits our taste ah
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
eh very nice lah we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but uh ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that uh
not not not the sink ah kitchen tap
quite a few lah and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus oh one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
to finish off the ah
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
aiya
I don't know lah it's both it is both uh frustrating and funny at the same time eh
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then err
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
uh
self guilt lah I think so I don't know lah
ya
cement
oh
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship lah
ya
ya the was
uh ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him lah probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain oh ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery lah but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
mm ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare lah how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how lah
which one we we want to choose
ah
so
mm
ya
major major lah
mm
mm
kan
one uh so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package ah
oh
ya
kan might as well kan
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
do it
mm
mm mm
okay lah thousand five ah eh
so I think ya lah
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in uh uh in the future we have uh
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
ah
ya
send me the one
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring ah
I think that one is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that one the the more expensive one
mm
but have to
you have to ya lah everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
if we have the the budget can consider lah I think that one's quite expensive is around
wah but I find it like very good leh
and it's wireless
mm
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
uh brands uh
uh have that those type of uh two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that one very good ah uh I think
can can consider lah if we have the means
but now we aiya we see how for now we just use manually first ah
use the sucking mop ah
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
uh sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive ah
ya that one really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence ah because like I told you earlier on
err ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence lah
ya
mm
the specific uh ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
ah ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well lah
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
mm
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally lah ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya lah like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
mm
mm
uh I think this saturday we we settle uh akid's uh school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare akid uh school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
uh the the the the renovation ah
mm so actually we K we we need to ya lah we ours we we are the one who should
direct them oh we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration ah
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but ah ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want

mm just rerun of friends and big bang theory
mm not yet why is it good what is it about
sounds like a good show leh
maybe I give it a shot
what else do you think about often black
okay thanks
I see about that
okay ah thanks
uh by the way uh what do you think I should prepare now while waiting for a full time job
okay I guess I'll prepared that where do I find this kind of sample
okay sure then if I prepare interview outfit what do I need to wear blazer and tie
okay
maybe I'll try find
thanks but
ya lah hopefully something will turn up lah after the after all the application
o
okay lah okay I take note oh ya by the way then that time uh besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix uh what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a show
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
oh ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see uh who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated uh hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and raquel finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my ah two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or
okay maybe I check that out ah but are you buying anything
eh
oh serious ah are you buying
oh ya then uh alesya belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
huh but azam isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay lah if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase ah
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what oh
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it lah I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true lah degree is important I'll think about it lah
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just uh rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree uh sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in uh in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored lah
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company ah I mean
uh usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he uh when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with uh a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
uh he is under maintenance side and technician uh if I'm not wrong uh under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know lah
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know lah I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as uh prison warden ya uh he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
uh the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace uh at just besides changi prison so
in a way beneficial for him lah don't need to stress about you know buying bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place ah for him
if I'm not wrong ah
oh uh he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent uh not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they uh they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy flats but then uh they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the they they bought if I'm not wrong lah
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years ah that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then uh she told me about the benefit uh when she just join full time they even uh give you uh benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even uh
another friend of mine uh she works at adventure if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new khatib home ya she told me about it
they also provide err you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct lah but and all ya
err adventure no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of uh fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company eh not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that err
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya lah just help me out if I need
fourth december he
uh fourth december ha
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
uh she told me err what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because uh she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated oh she also she also has degree by the way
uh chemical chemical science meaning I think err
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya uh right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while lah ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like jurong island that kind of thing that share more of like
uh exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from if I'm not wrong
ya
okay lah anyway
my bike what what you mean
mm my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
ah that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
uh tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation oh my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two it became
up to four so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
his job is basically ah what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now ah ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
um maybe lah I guess see how
I mean first choice would be
second then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same lah but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small uh company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me lah
oh ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
uh engineer but ya lah I mean wouldn't uh wouldn't know if the company needs or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
uh if you want to you can so ya when I heard he
it's just another few more hours so okay what
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
mmhmm
oh ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
huh I thought it's under your name
uh there are demo too young because
oh
ha chain
chain adjust
oh
alamak
oh that time he ask me err he he asked me that uh how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
so I told him like roughly lah how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as uh much more than his monthly but I told him lah
I told him ah that time I I hit about uh four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked ah my pay
was higher than him then tell him lah but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him lah the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him lah to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him lah
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure lah because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
then I told him lah
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him ah I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it lah
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
err
then he was he was shocked lah I say no lah because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked lah he he he judge but whatever lah I mean
I mean you just want to try try only what then and then I told him lah
like it's all up to individual lah I mean all
I I tell him what all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
uh I told him uh
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face lah
uh was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
roo is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket uh add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable lah because
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
oh okay lah maybe I see about that
but okay lah I mean I wouldn't complain already lah I mean as long as the market is good already lah because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
uh now uh based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to hougang mall
plain clothes the act like they are but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I uh she she ride but she put under but err bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her lah ah they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me lah what's the logic behind this grab enforcers oh I mean I'm working what but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say lah like
oh is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair what I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly ah wah that sucks
okay I'll take note lah

start okay okay so
okay start from the
so he stuck at lookout for suspicious character lah
but why can't she the be so why can't she be clear
okay
so new sia
ah uh
mm
mm
mmhmm
clear about what he's getting
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
okay
mm because we haven't even consented to this relationship in the first place
cough up lah information
mm
mm
go into that yes
ya
okay
ya which you you might not but you might not agree ah
ah ah mmhmm
ya ya lah but I guess baby steps then after that
did you did you specifically say that
ya mm
hmm
ah
mm
a'ah seh
okay so
oh so just the informal ya
ah
ah
mm
you said
mm
mm
ah
okay
dayah's ah ah
mm mm
so fed up ah this type of thing
I don't think he even thinks like this lah
oh
foresight a'ah
did you say that did you say
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
are you sure or not salim I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
haiya
I mean I haiya I don't know what to feel about this
ya
send ya
must take this action
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether uh I
pushed or zina will be pulled down
err big personality how to say not big lah firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
your life will turn out well
ah
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to dayah
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with izat
huh you talk about marriage to izat like what
this was before lah
seriously
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
ya but zina can also ask you the same then why and why you and izat is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and izat are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya lah
ya lah because also also dayah always clamps her down
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya lah
ya ya
hidayah is clamping her down lah
ya ya
huh
ah ah ah where
you said that okay
okay
you said that ah then
ya
it's very hard and you will often require a certain mm
change of life events or certain

okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
oh was it with his girlfriend also
serious oh is it because of his surprise birthday party uh
so what have you decided
eh how do you get her number ah I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
wah your friend is so going to feel betrayed sia
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
so dah decide
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
orh
but you think he okay or not
serious ah
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza lah
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever lah
oh
okay
oh forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
oh that's good deal man
eh can you share the link with me
mm
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
alah
oh okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
oh and fly kite
oh
can you please buy a good kite
I don't know
oh but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter lah that had shade
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
what time you intend to go ah that's the point
mm
actually that day
mm
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know fuh
okay actually to me lah is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like Razi did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places ah then what happen ah
oh he will ah okay okay um because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
oh okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
gone
but ya that's very nice lah of the girlfriend
mm
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
Marina Bay uh Marina Marina Bay lah kan
Barrage if you got no car you go Sentosa
oh because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay lah
oh okay then Marina Barrage makes sense lah
yes yes yes
mm
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have meriahness if there is
I mean aiya for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
ya ya actually it's true lah I I mean no I personally don't like Sentosa
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for Sentosa
earlier lah
oh it's a weekend ah
ah
okay
oh ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
orh
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before lah in Singapore
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
ah okay
ah
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
the birthday boy is gonna be from
Tampines
not the other side of the Singapore right
ah
ah okay
wait where she stay again
near my house
ah near my friend's place okay okay okay
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
oh my god
anyway motor is convenient ah
but I think
oh really
so early ah it's indoor what
oh you mm okay lah I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay lah
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
uh I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow lah huh
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people lah so I always leave it to other people
oh ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like ah
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better ah
food
okay all growing boys
ya but to me mm okay lah for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
oh okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
mm then what she say
oh my god
uh then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
uh mee tom yum mm one of them
no because now
ah
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason lah eh let's say
um
yes
ya you can't be bothered not like you're gonna eat much anyway
but
which you will probably be bringing because if you are after our lesson of going to Marina Barrage that day I
regret not bring water bottle
yeah I didn't bring water bottle that time what
and still not enough
I think once we
yeah and you need to have wet weather programme ah
oh it's very sudden
like what
you guys are his world too
yeah
yeah so it's nice that as a girlfriend she put in effort to do that
for what
are you serious
ya lah
so that you can focus on your work ah
you don't have any other friends meh
you have right
yeah
oh you got further subset of your
mm
I know I know you know I know I know already lah
a'ah
but they don't
okay the subsets don't overlap ah
ya lah
orh
okay okay I know I know
and the same person I don't like too okay
wah I should make friends with this friend of yours lah
ah ya lah
no but I think he's like that because he sees what she do also lah
hypocrite he feels I think this is the long hair guy right that you don't like right ya ya ya
if I don't like you ah it will show on my face so you better don't see my face
yeah
it's okay lah no loss to him
yeah
yeah
so is no to him is no loss lah so that's why he's like that
do you do they know that you meet each other
oh they know ah so
ah okay
yeah and I know why you don't wanna go
yeah
oh confirm ah
it's confirmed
mm
did they did somebody you directly
alamak
uh huh
yeah you told me that
mm
now
it's okay
it's okay
orh
orh
you told me right is that the one
right the indian muslim one and the that one right ya
okay lah
hmm hmm
I don't know I don't I don't miss in any way
ya I definitely won't be one of them
oh Marissa Shu you never go before ah
I think if you go with Shu also it'll be fun
you enjoy or you don't enjoy
oh
ya lah
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say ah
oh but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant lah but okay lah I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
mm
but they make you feel included lah
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that Shiqah Ad Razi group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean Aidil they all but I rarely get to meet him lah but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends sia oh and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
ah
but I think two person is much more better leh I feel lah
don't know lah I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
aiya but they going week weekend ah
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
I don't know how you can recognise such faces seh
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
ah no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary ah
try ah
cannot ah
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
I went there share I went with who ah I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
early part eh
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
oh crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay what
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared sia
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
yes
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
how
what
oh my god okay
oh
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
oh so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
opinion
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
because if he doesn't hide
ah he will say
a bit meh
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be Aidil lah up till now
actually actually is true eh
and then his mum will be left
aww
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
oh I don't tell her so that uh she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who ah
ah I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
path you wanna take ah I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
I remember
Kartini will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then ah whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already lah this one
then uh I remember lah the one in my secondary school is this
um very strict indian discipline guy you know
we were like
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
oh ya we we I tell you we are nerds what we can spend in library from nine eh nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
um was I like that for secondary school
I don't think so eh
no I'm busy for but I think on weekends when I have no
weekends when I have
yeah that's why nobody see me
yeah
no every week I study okay wait this the thing about me okay
people people try to what they call it ah
crash study crash
crash lah they try to crash everything into their mind after that ya that's I was thinking
yeah
uh so so for me I cannot so every week I actually have a revision for myself
we will go for lunch break
and then go back to library study
and then after that you take a tea break
at five O'clock tea break or dinner and then after that the best part is
yeah consistency cause I cannot take stress
I cannot take stress
when I found out that last minute I had test right in primary school did I tell you
I called her because they got surprise test
yeah
so it was during I can't remember which level ah in primary school and then the funny thing is
I found out that later on after the uh after our recess got test right then I call
my mum ask uh hello then I say
then I keep quiet then my mum hello
I didn't study that's the part I'm super stressed
I cannot take surprises
ya I cannot
I
oh
surprise
cannot lah sia I will be stressed
okay lah
that's
yeah I only learn that at my later part of my age ah
I realised I
eh don't tell this to Farid ah cause
he will laugh his pants off if he hears his mum is such a
yeah yeah yeah it must be like after after school days lah
after
if not he will use it against me
you know I don't like it when people use it against me
ya man I remember you normally
oh my god
A for commitment
but apparently it wasn't A for your final results
ya ya ya
if only they grade effort ah
drill
bit
ah ya
oh shit
are you serious
switch
hospital
ya that I know even though I didn't do O level I took O level I take I took sec two O okay
shaved plastic shave
yes
oh my gosh
this one laughed
oh ya actually it's true ah a drill is quite safe ah
you ask her it it kiap the thing right it's supposed to be
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya I know I know I know
I did my in sec two
I did something it was something I can bring back but of course I threw it away already I guess
wah that's a nice phone is that Ada's phone
no no I think it's Samsung
ya so I was a geek lah we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay uh
oh in the morning when you come then you ask each other eh
geography lah geography maths science okay
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater huh
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level ah
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
ah
ah because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
uh yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
oh sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
uh arts uh sports and
uh I don't know geek lah I would categorise uh debate as geek lah I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood lah it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek lah okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool lah debater oh I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why eh I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game um minefield
eh that one is I tell you ah
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject lah
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch oh
like how curious a a kid is oh why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the oh so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I oh the only reason why I went for that course was because ah ah ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
uh who err so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late uh we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up lah basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
ah
eh come on lah I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
he hor we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say eh you know ah
actually the head prefect saw my face already ah just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl ah
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class lah
eh so and so so and so saw my face already know wah if he see that I disappear already ah sure he will mark me one
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school lah sia
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
walao eh this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention lah
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually uh supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself lah
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no lah of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
oh
a'ah
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
oh my god
oh but the discipline master doesn't know you personally ah
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so pai kia ah
all cannot make it sia
ah
huh
eh actually primary school classes are the worst to manage ah
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths ah okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that one especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun lah they are innocent ah so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can ah if ya

don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
um I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand ah most
fully because it was in a tour
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
there are shared memories together ah
oh berry van eh
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
and ya lah so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then lah my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya um and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
ah despite my aunts' protestations
and ya lah so he jump ah he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply lah kan you got there
and once you are done ya lah I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
ya
actually for new zealand um
the year that I went
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match ah so
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
err
eh did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
ah was that the first time I felt snow
err
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun lah
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine eh
ya
K lah how chocolate is the best lah
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
ah apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
woo shiok ah
wilsons promontory
dapat
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food ah kan
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
err
ya
um you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
um you can even decide on the spot that hey I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I just gonna shoot straight for
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
wanna drive all the way um
what they do is they drive
to penang
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border oh you see
so to me
then the other alternative is fly to
krabi or fly to phuket
ya
ya
true but then I felt that okay lah I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience lah of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship lah kan
cabin cabin
ya
it wasn't that bad
no lah I guess when it got
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm lah
ah
oh ya
ya I think supermarkets overseas ah
um there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
because they are the producers ah that's why
ah meat so fresh
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
true
even the ice cream is different
okay
because you have a variety to choose from ah
much more predictable in that sense
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
quite common
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
mm ya
and the best donuts in the world
eh do you notice
it could be ya
we ordered the the bombolinis lah the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
um
and
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique um overflowing
so they were oozing out and okay lah I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world lah
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya oh and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
plantains eh
did they grill that one grill kan
I think it was grilled and then they put um brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that ah
ya that one
eh there was something that I thought about um oh oh oh oh oh oh um london um
the devil brownies ah
ya that was a random find ah no we went to that
that weekend market
um I wouldn't say it's a random find lah because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
ah correct
where aspiring business owners visit this there err these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons ah so these dragons are
um so ya she pitch her brownies to them ah
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
err she used that as part of her advertisement lah
ah but I really good are really really good
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
ah noodle oodle um that's just
soup ah
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
K imagine nandos ah so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
ah the price the price is way cheaper than nandos ah
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab ah
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
ah yes
eh the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name ah a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice ah
ya what else ah
what else was nice that we have
oh buffet that that buffet was power
eh that was a nice chance upon ah
that was not in our initial plan lah because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
um ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay lah it's a saving grace lah
it's a saving grace because I think
um those ya that jacket potato was nice
ya it was milkshake and skittles ah
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian lah at least oh that was some nice jacket potato
ya
that's true
kan
ya cheaper lah ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands err on prada
understand ah it's still thousands eh
B I C E S T E R bicester
yes
somewhere near the south
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
okay lah
so far none so far the three of our major trips
we have there are this this three major lah the and the two australia
ah
oh
err
slide down the slope ya
best ah
fifty
mm
oh
ya
the beaches err jog my memory again where did we go
oh sydney ya bondi
I think we did
portsmouth
ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay lah I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
um
oh oh ya ya ya
ah
but it's hot ah
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have err
two thousand let me recall ah when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
um we went to travel around the areas lah so we went to spain um
specifically we went to madrid lah
so err I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
mm ya
um I think you really have to plan
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
so I remember there was one um
so when we reach belgium
um we thought that the bus station uh at that belgium to the airport was quite near lah
only for us to realise that actually
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely ah
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
um
ya
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour lah but sixty kilometres away ya kan so it's still quite a distance
forty five minutes to get there ah
this was the start lah almost the start I think ya
so we negotiated lah we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind ah he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind err I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros lah basically
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation kan
and then by the time we reach there he
uh maybe three quarters ah
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got lah and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed lah maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey ah
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight lah but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
ya and uh I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you lah
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid lah ah but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
err I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think ah
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
ah so dah happy happy
ya that was that was an
ya
oh I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
no
ya
so
no
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each ah
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it ah
ya
power ah
ya that's why
ya
ya
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ah like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
ya
ah yup
true
who came up to us
say assamualaikum and started to err to talk to us in malay
so we talk to him when quite further in he said oh actually yes he's bangladeshi
for
working ah so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then um you know went back went to spain to work lah
ya working overseas is something
okay lah not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months ah of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close ah but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome ah to the point that I felt that hey
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both ah
okay so um when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
um the or the muslim students association they were quite
um vibrant and there are very active lah
so um I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them lah
because when I were went there also um
it coincided with the fasting month
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short ah

um
ah so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
uh huh
so other than
when you
ah yes so is so now when you see for yourself eh actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
ah I enjoy eating it which is something good lah kan hopefully
you can cook ah more things lah
ah exercise more ah exercise more in the imagination lah in reality I won't exercise
ah yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
eh this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya lah ten years ago still can play lah but now I think it'd be better
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play ah maybe
ah if I play football with
ah I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become lah
doubt so lah I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it lah don't want to waste my energy ah
during the malaysia cup ah
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over lah first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
ah whom is like
and the passion is just not there lah I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities ah
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
ah football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
for the money for the fame kan then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
ah in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
ah I can just ah imagine myself to be ronaldo or messi
on the screen
kan if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers kan
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
you can basically
contact with the with the people
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things ah um
uh huh
yes
ya so that is the different lah people change
kan so maybe certain things will be left behind lah
ah
ah
ah
ah
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time lah kan cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
ah impossible ah kan ah
okay um
yes
ah behind kan then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
ah just nice for his ah
or his or her development
in the future lah even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
ah ah
yes correct
ah
um
ah
ya lah
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
ah
ah but in terms of travelling
ah malaysia kan
ah ah maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia ah
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
ah um
ah favourite place ah favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay lah our singapore dollar is strong lah then
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe kan
but it's a really complete
uh shopping lah
for the clothes only lah
ah
ah
ah
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay kan but of course there is there different lah when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new kan but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is ah is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
our kid also will enjoy it more also lah kan
uh but
yes ah
ah ya lah you will set the goal when you go ah
ah ah
ah I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part lah kan
I mean
ya lah I think certain things you are more
ah
comfortable in handling and
ah certain things I am more comfortable in handling lah I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
ah planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
ya lah ah when authoritative-ness then
people don't argue with you
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
ah then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
ah
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay lah
ah
we are realistic lah kan what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over lah I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small lah but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it kan so that is the difference
ah ah
ah ya
I think for the jakarta one
when we reach
there we were like eh
first thing is the airport lah
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
err shopping centres err in the eighties kan
so okay lah that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
uh
ah
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
ah something being kept for so long
it's not rotten ah it's like the carpet never wash for so long
ah lah
quite enjoyable lah in jakarta the
different way of life
ah
yes
yes our wedding
ah our wedding planner ah
ah ah
uh huh ah yes
yes correct ah ah
um ah
ah the third
ah
hotel
basically is ah it's all paid for
the tour is ah
the tour is all planned ah so the driver the vehicle all all is provided
basically we are just supposed to
be there
and everything is actually planned for us we just follow eh
ah
testing ah ah
tanah abang
yes
ah
have to buy clothes same pattern but different colours kan
just for the sake of
ah getting err
cheaper cheaper price ah kan
they don't sell by one piece one piece
they sell by oh you must buy at least three must buy at least four and
we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore
err
is money yes
ah ah ah
ah
ask for directions
open the door for us
just holding the door still will be expecting us to
ah
ya other than jakarta we went to ah
is a couple so called couple retreat ah two couples ah
raja and lina correct
um ah yes
ah
ah ah
ah
ah ah ah yes
ah
ah
ah attraction
and happened we went to
quite
okay lah because your friend is also like
looking out for us and
so we we feel safe ah then
ah the hotel it was ah harris hotel a'ah
ah so it's
in terms of the hotel is is nice lah not old not
over not so that impressive but
ah okay lah
basic necessities are there in terms of the the cleanliness of what you call it you know the cleanliness
ah we have a driver yes
a'ah
a'ah
yes ah
kuta beach ah
it it is the way they set up the kuta beach
is like trying to follow gold coast ah so it's like this one is gold coast
ah in indonesia lah gold coast bali
ah the way they set up but of course a bit different lah first the
the cleanliness of the beach
a'ah
ah ya motorcycle ah ah mm
a'ah
into the sea ah ya ah
yes ah
the water is not so
so blue lah in compared to gold coast
ah gold coast the water is blue but now got sharks
mm mm
a'ah
a'ah mm
yes a'ah ah
ah mm
we took almost ah half a day
ah guide
so we are staying in the vehicle to go up all the way to the
in all to reach there but ah
ah we enjoyed a lunch down there
ah not fully
fully build
ah kan because I sitting down I can still see the
metal metal part sticking out
not safe lah
I think he won't dare to go to go to the toilet ah
yes
a'ah mm
oh the guys
clearly lah which a good thing lah
uh huh uh huh
ah
ah
a'ah
yes
ah that's the first trip ah
that is the first time I met
raja and ah ah I think for you first time meet lina ah for me first time I meet both
ah can click kan a'ah
ah
ah mmhmm
ah
malaysia ah
a'ah
yes ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
older lah ah older
but the penang one could have been better cause if not raining
four families cut down to three ended up to two kan ah
ah
if there is a travel restriction
ministry of foreign affairs will be alert
and they will say
ah advise people not to go there ah a'ah
yes
I enjoy the food down there
ah
home of P ramlee
penang yes
ah ah
ah
ah like very interested to talk to to us eh ah
ah
ah yes that one is the the tower
ah ah ah eh they say what
they emphasise as the biggest
the biggest curve
in southeast asia
ah it's the biggest
ah
ah scared of heights ah
ah
but if I yes
ah
ah that time the new attraction they haven't finish doing yet ah the new attraction they
you can be you can I think you can do flying fox a short
flying fox lah then outside the building
that one they haven't finish yet ah I think if that one already have I think you can forget it about raja going on it lah ah
that one is the bukit bendera
ah ah yes
ah][ah um)(um
ah ah ah um
ah ah ya
but it was very bad remember that time even then malaysian chief
the prime minister then even though they are from opposition
when we are inside the van kan we can see the certain places which was
ah damaged lah due to the due to the flood
ah then one thing about penang ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
they conserve so they make it part of the building kan which is ah a bit
but
conserve for the sake of ah conserving ah sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them lah cause they did conserve their ah
upside down museum ah um
singapore rediscovery vouchers ah
hopefully it's worth it
life go back a bit more to normal ah then we can start our travelling plans at least travel plans doubt so lah other countries we cannot control kan
but hopefully in singapore we can can do it lah eh
at least meet up so we won't be so
ah no new cases ah
a'ah
ah ah shopping centre
ya lah ah
kan ah disposable shoes disposable clothes then
okay so other than travel
ah in year twenty twenty one lah kan lah what would be
your wish your hope in twenty twenty one
mm
ah primary two hopefully he will do better than in primary one
ah
mmhmm mmhmm yes
family members ah ah
so other than that for me is err ah
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
ah maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated lah trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
I will go with the majority lah and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue oh then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
ah
a'ah
ah
eh lah
a'ah
mm
ah
ah yes
ah
ah
ah yes
ah cousin ah
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best lah
I I submit document I submit application
ah
ah
the thing is is like that
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother lah kan
have to go through a lot of places lah
the future
you have to go through a certain
authorised by us to do the ah assessment so go through check up again
so um um
ah ah
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done kan
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then ah
I think now is
ah
involved ah uh huh
ah do the best that he can be ah
enjoy enjoy what
ah make try to make his life ah
meaningful lah that is what
ah
ah
ah ah
a'ah
a'ah
um um um
um um um ah
um um a'ah
eat lah ah
a'ah
poly ah
uh ah
a'ah
a'ah

mm
mm because
and having a lot of money
or like when I want to buy something that I like
then the second one I think I want my own transport
oh best part is
but I since I already
the travel you know
ya then the third one
I want to have like
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
so what about you
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
talking about family gathering
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
so
I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
mm
mm
mm
ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait lah for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
then
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like
no lah we put that aside first then we
chalet
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food lah
forever food and our transportation
like
share among us
book out already kan so okay lah
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
kan celebration also need more money
decoration need money also
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
party together like that
um you know that a
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ah
mm
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
ya lah marina is nice lah
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one uh one place where I know
outdoor pe
cause that time when I went uh to marina
uh I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there ah
so
we
parasol whatever lah
ah splash lah
like
but still like nice because
I think I think our cousin have I think ah I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still uh that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
oh
ya ya this one ah
mm nice we can go this kind
mm
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
they let us
mm
I not sure later after this we can google ah whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
mm
mm
mm
we confirm know we won't sleep what
oh nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle lah
mm
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate eh
no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad ah
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade lah no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
whoa okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before ah but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
mm
what about glove
for rental lah
mm
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want ah
what if people really got like
pee on it or what eww but ya still ee okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
you want to play with the animal
ya I don't know what what I mean okay maybe our interest like so different like
like
what's more that that you can do over there
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that
but I think they got to bring their children right
mm
that's why I say but okay ah okay ah it's a nice idea
then we can go for like normal outing also you know I feel like we should just
go out like normally
time to spend together you got like
you working they working
mm mm mm
nice ya but
then the rock climbing indoor
ah zip line I I I don't think so hello inside the mall have zip line
when I was interning at kallang
but I feel shy
ya ya you need to pay I mean like obvious lah you need to pay but it's like
munch munch on snack or what
mm
ah ya lah can but
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
ah ya lah since we already book right we don't need to personally book in with our own body pe
no lah I mean we can just say what sorry excuse me this is my place I already booked this place uh then you can just ask them to go out lah
mm
so ya
but I'm gonna stay at the side
can what
but it's nice what it's like when you at the seaside
nice what it's such a good
uh memories
serious lah then after that
you
ya
you cook one I cook one
okay lah whatever lah nice whatever lah okay
and then we ask then
while waiting they
ask them to buy or whatever buy all the stuff all that
ya
mm
so that
oh I I don't think so ya
I mean it's gonna be only the two of us
mmhmm
ah so that's what you meant
no lah we just put at the same place lah
like I mean like the same kind
so
mm all the same so that
ya
ah ya ya ya nice what like that we can just throw after that
mm
mmhmm
eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
mm
sushi
kimbap that kind of thing we can do
because
but if not whatever
mushroom
mm mmhmm
since okay so what I'm planning to do is
we
we from this side from west side we bring food
they from east side bring all the drinks and chips
so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
then we need one mineral water confirm
mm ah ya lah obvious
a'ah
mmhmm
ah ya lah
uh them to
as long as everyone can eat
mm
mmhmm
wait ah
mm
okay ah
ya okay lah not bad can
mmhmm
a'ah
orh
ah
what I mean is
mmhmm
so they will put everything inside only what
ah so I felt that it's more cleaner like that no
okay maybe for us ya but maybe not for them lah
mm
mm mmhmm
take out everything
open all the cans put inside one bowl
ya
so then after that
if we buy the one with the crust then we ask them to cut the crust
which is nice ah
then
sugar and butter together inside
melted butter
mushroom ball ah mushroom ball is nice
hmm
kan that's nice
mm
we going glamping yay
ya
ya like the normal picnic right ya
ya
mmhmm
but we tell them already what from from like
and before that we also need to talk about and about the gift right
so
uh if you want talk about the gift then I think everyone need to fork out about ten to twenty dollars
I don't know I don't know if it's better for us to fork out ten to twenty dollar each
for both of them or it's better to just buy whatever
we're gonna spend a lot of money there
mm
mm okay ah nice
mm mm mm
mm
oh and I think we should have a
colour code
then we
ah
mmhmm
blue
ah okay ah nice
hmm
so
green
but no lah I felt like
okay what blue and green
pink
pink pink
ya lah nice what
nice lah nice
I think our plan like nice already don't need to change
so later we make a whatsapp group right and then we talk about them we can just
uh tell all the plans from A to Z nice
but no black
huh
forbidden
okay ah nice nice

I'm planning to lik
two lah because the um the flat will only be ready in middle twenty not really middle lah early twenty twenty three so logically is the year before lah ah
err so like I mean if I were to move as in just yesterday we were discussing lik
err
so it doesn't make sense lah to travel from the west to the east the east to the west then after tha
ah the one definite lah
so that one will take time definitely don't know how long it take lah bu
definitely will have to stay at one place first lah it's either my side or his side lah
so that's why the the the budget is a concern lah
um
oh it's not like one whole thin
but but then if you do everything at once right it's save time righ
for the location if let's say you want to do for bridal then do photography videograph
chey
err they have catering they have decoration with including the err plumbing also and then err they include the door gift
and then err tables and chairs all set up all the basic everything is there except that the only thing that top up that one is just and
such old school you have to follow according to what happened last time so we must have everything must have a big wedding so my concern is that if I cannot afford I mean not he cannot afford lah if I cannot commit to tha
another fact is that I'm the first one I'm the first child so obviously as a father want to show off mah so like err very proud you know finally you know somebody err my my child is getting married or whatever but the
alah they don't know the the cost to get tha
err there's no need for any vehicle lah I mean there's only just need one way lah just to do the whatever photo shoot after the weddin
ah that's why at least everything will be there so for example if let's say you do at orchard at that hote
at least you know the night before stay one night after that ah want to get ready just go dow
burning hair to think of i
I suggested to my mum lah like come lah to meet me and give me advice lah
I don't know like nowadays people like I mean due to this pandemic kan
so people are starting to to get married now because due to limited in capacity kan because my own friend also she's getting married on end of the yea
but then because is they have to top up more s
uh manage to find at this particular location somewhere in the west lah so uh it's not a location that is suitable for wedding lah it's more to like education wis
ah so err they had to actually emerged certain rooms to become one big roo
something like you know those typical conference room meeting room right so um no not they had to make this type of compromise but at least its it does not affect in a way that they have to top up mor
they are is still within their budget but their problem is right because now you cannot have buffet you have to give bento bo
the balance of the money that supposed to be deposited for the wedding right she actually used to take out one more photographe
ah so at least you know you don't have to be stuck with just one so you just two so after that uh
became because of that also one good thing lah I mean not about travel so she splurge out her so called honeymoon in singapore err
ya lah the week after the wedding lah she will do that means like I think mayb
within december lah she'll she'll do honeymoo
it'll take about like a yea
so the next one will be second time already which has a lower chance of ballo
alternativ
ya that was the initial plan but you know lah as usual pay me but then
the groom side is giving a gift lah to the bride side is i
is it err oh
ya but some people still want to display the notes righ
ya ya true dare to it y
err so is there a magazine is through Facebook lah so this lady was cheated and um you know I jus
why you go and marry the guy if you know that you're not ready for it if you're not financially already s
that's the thing lah and when it comes to this thing as in wedding and marriage it all comes down back to mone
if you they will the basically right their terms like if you have more guests is cheaper so to avoid tha
as in basically kan you need to have okay ah for example like that that that particular location at orchard err it's for one thousand person is about twenty plus plus per perso
then another company is offering that oh if let's say you wanted maybe about five hundred people lah ya for both side that means two fifty each right then it'll cost about the same pric
or maybe slightly more but of course lah about thirty dollar plus plus and then leh I compared those tw
they only offering two then drinks also is like oh asia's err hot tea coffee and then like one cold drin
this this one is the one that another company lah not the one at orchard is another company so to me is that ya your food is nice your decoration is very nice we went to th
showcase and is all very nice very tempting and they even offered multiple locations but you offer your location but then you
package is so not good it's difficult you know and then uh there was one time err the package includes brida
you compared the price of each eh to a brida
stay we will just stay until until the end even until the end also nobody else will just stay right maybe about ten minutes or s
um we will only book one event for one da

so far I think they're okay just that the girl is going to primary one now

I'm actually looking for a tuition teacher now for her do you think I'm crazy
ya but singapore is so competitive I'm just worried about her
hais
what do you think
ya but last time you don't have this stress now everything is about good marks good school hais stress lah
mm but I still think like we need
a tuition teacher because my husband feel feel that we should start young eh you got any tuition friend or not
tuition teacher
ah but I think there are different rates for this
maybe about forty to fifty
I want them to come to my house lah I don't want to travel out already very tiring you know
good good thank you thank you
eh so uh you wanna sit down somewhere like coffeeshop or something
where got atas you lah you work in what museum don't know what I not working eh

ya lah my
wait lah

actually true lah because every time I fetch my kids ah then I see the maid like
just on their phone ah then never never even like take care of the kids some of them just allow the kids to run haiya crazy ah I don't know why this
these err their bosses ah never check on them
abuse
ya lah so
abuse what you mean by you abuse
so serious
orh you see lah I stay home so long ah never even read news hais I think I must start reading news to keep up myself
ya eh now COVID then how they want to engage maid
can or not ah
I think I rather stay home
keep my home clean
mm
mm
five days
so
oh
wah
hmm
mm
mm
uh huh
oh mm
stress at work
mm
ah
eh mm now got what exhibition over there
wow mm
but
mm
mm
mm
so a lot of people uh take leave
eh you redeem already
hmm
managed to book a few
attraction
so I don't know how it works
orh
mm
ya that's true
go johor
and then I can buy all my baking stuff
ya
but now COVID I don't have you know we we can't travel out and then everything over here is so expensive
so at least when I I get to go johor at least I make a bit more profit
mm
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya that's true lah eh you know about talking about government ah they give the free mask new one I haven't collect yet and then the the best thing is they have the
the mask for kids so just have to measure
how big is your face if I'm not wrong
ah then my friend tried it then
well
know
ya
mm
mm
mm
kan the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
mm
mm
mm
mm but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country lah but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go um
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
mm
ya that's true
mm
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have um
enough people it's about
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless lah
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
daily ah mm
mm
mm
wah eh you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
mm mm
okay
mm
ah
mm
hmm
oh
fifteen dollars per hour
mmhmm
hmm
expose lah
oh
mm
precautionary order at mm
housewife just like me
mm
mmhmm
they know better lah
mm
mm
mm
that's true
eh ah I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
mmhmm
huh
is
we'll see
uh huh
a few cartons
mm
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
hmm
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
can lah if not you can just order in
mm
ya that's true
mm but it's quite expensive lah but
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
eh
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
mm
mm
hmm ya
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle lah but lucky he is not using because he's uh on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
mm
ya that's true
hmm
ya that's true
mm
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched lah I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
hmm
some of them even went to uh try
wah it's really you have to work extra hard for this uh
mmhmm
mm
oh
oh
mm
that's long
mm maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying uh well
mm
oh
mmhmm
mm
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then um my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of um what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive lah on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
um having that symptom of COVID nineteen
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary kan
mmhmm

if your job is just that you you also would do it what like looking forward to it
if no money
if no money

fat

sia ah
so it's all about you
want to
disrupt other people's family or what then you know their plans
but still
then
eh then then okay then if example eh
then imagine if papa want to pass away then she then he have to pass down or whatever shit
if have to pass down to females we are the only two
I don't know
male female
then would you take it
if it if they have to pass down to female
then that means I have to take it
why
why can't you sacrifice for me
why can't you sacrifice for me
half half
no should take like
on
on even weeks
of the year follow me on odd weeks of the year follow you
ya
no but
I don't know
it's like we have to
that's what that's what my friend say also
because I like to go to these kind of places what
all the haunted places
then that time I I tell I thought I told you before
then I when um they say always go in even numbers right went in odd
then I was the only girl and I was having my menses
except for me
then after that
a veranda
out on level two or level three then we were just there sitting to smoke first ah before going down back because the place was like super horrible with a lot of broken glasses and such
then while sitting there a black figure was
like
you know I can feel all these right
and and the black figure
all of us saw
and it was like literally like just
hung uh
hanging like
around me cause we were when I was sitting there at the porch
it's me and another two friend
no eh they were asking me black figure then I was like no like it's you can't blame me there's two other
people beside me and
out of out of like
three of them can see things
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
mm what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
ah
then like eh
I don't know
sometimes I feel like I want to go and ask
I feel like I just want to know whether I have something with me or not
eh no he got nine wives so so I you be ten then I'll be eleven
no the lina's cafe is not his it's one of his wives
I don't want to
number eleven is more prettier than me
marriage
they can only stare at you
because I can't help you
why I don't know ah
mm
like so I still don't know whether I want to take picture or not sia I I don't feel like going
I feel you
I feel you because I see you
do do you want to build a snowman
pet pet shops don't sell

no lah the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before what just like the night safari
the four items ah the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
err
think eleven plus ah
oh uh wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge ah seven plus to nine
two you uh ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this one right
uh we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going what you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go lah
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also lah can
the three of them
but if affaf don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two lah
then it's two two each
Subway
mm ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough lah don't know ya
have to
is the camera uh waterproof
don't have ah
can
her studies finish already what her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
err
affif I think he doesn't want to go down
eh what
twentieth right
the following week lah after christmas
can eh no cannot
yes uh uh
cannot
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have ah not open yet ah okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups lah so the kids
all the children
add up uh
it's just nice
force lah
monday
that's why first person to check is aisyah
but if you I I don't know whether
err
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
then you ask her
then if she what he say lah you ask her for her opinion and all
get the ball rolling
since
so my family side I can suggest
uh ya lah there is a few suggestion lah one is
um we split into two groups
so one group is maybe uh
ya
go to the one that is more lah kan
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there lah
so affif affaf shafie three
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
and I think they don't mind lah because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya lah
but I think if it's like just cousins
then
you have how many uh eight plus four twelve
twelve children
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
then they
K if it's a red line ah and it's too um
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
ah
amin I mean we all have been coming over
we ah mahir because the other time his family come over amin come over amin the whole family his whole family come over
okay do how ah
uh
ya lah uh we can give suggestions and then let them think
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest amin would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
uh at one time at one go
and then err
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay lah then after that
of course lah
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
ah apply
just that maybe amin uh only
the two older eh umar also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if umar is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
K so
mm
right okay so what else ah do you want to talk about um
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya lah
very difficult
ya cannot one
the night safari
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
twenty
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
or jewel
the
ya
we we also haven't gone what we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options lah so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
no
so okay lah at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that one
no the problem is
all others in singapore lah unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to what
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
um the problem with all other uh uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's uh and her lecturer one whom she took the last course kan
then she the lecturer actually say um
that
a topic module not on in these two uni lah
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
you have to write ah ah correct
so she's uh worried about the that part lah that's why
uh huh ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya lah
they actually have it leh the last time she say they the
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants ah
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
err
mm more working people are opting for that course more working people tau meaning people who are
let's say they uh they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us lah she uh or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student ah so she will be like considered as an adult already lah
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say uh
err income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
ah but actually that one not much lah
of course lah because she is ah
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
uh
ya lah
like that lah
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have uh all these other
unis ah which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
oh my god that's why I was
ya lah because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
it's very frustrating lah
ya so that one actually I thought uh I want to sit down with her and go through all the
ya lah
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
all those things lah so and she went in they were all telling her oh you know uh this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like affaf are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop uh
K so
we need another
ya we need another uh
round of her checking lah ya for her to check
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
ya lah
that's what he wants to do
so
ya lah she
lah
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based lah so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics lah right that's physics right
so more about physics
ah so you learn how to make
the uh you learn what is the because
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya lah you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
um
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application uh by this person
who wants to uh uh okay because I put up uh a post
ah resale
ya okay so two ah one is about the
um recruitment
uh I put
teacher coach uh at SAM lah
so so far
uh
two person submit one is a malay girl who
the other one is an indian lady
used to teach english
so she uh she apply but we are maths kan so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
ah that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because uh we already signed up what it's for free at that point in time lah
uh when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say uh this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
uh about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
ah
switch her lah
ya
ya lah paying the teacher only
correct lah
so okay lah so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
um a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
oh my god
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run ah let it run ah
so the partnership confirm don't want ah so I will message to say don't want ah
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya lah the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
ah
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
the worksheets for P three right ah
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue lah from there kan
okay so
progress report I told ira to do that already
ah the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
that's what you said to ira right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of ira you said to ira directly
I was there so I think it's okay lah let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out lah
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
can't be bothered to
and then we message the parents we have passed the
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
july right we're supposed to give uh first week july then we didn't give
so this one at least we give lah everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya lor
but then
buy over then he buy over lah
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
uh for uh the person who takes over is a full time
owner
tau so he was saying
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved lah
uh in
ya sort of like that lah ya correct
but I was thinking actually no lah uh yang was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut lah so I think he can
ya lah he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said lah a bit
you know I said uh uh in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot ah then I say during and all ya ya ya
uh I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only ah I can understand a bit but
uh chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say oh because
uh nearby our place uh it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so uh a lot of uh
uh
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
ah
then then uh because of that
um we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
oh okay okay but now got Google translate what
can just uh tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear lah
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say oh but the children can speak english what so the children can explain I say yes
um we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had uh chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy lah
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just oh okay
ah ah
ah that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct lah ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be uh with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to
uh uh he's a graduate
ah
so he was working
uh but it was only for a few months and then COVID
last to come it first to go
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
oh okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe lah
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like oh okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better uh candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
ah so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
err do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well uh and and starts in his course lah so he was saying
he understand children uh who have difficulty in maths lah he can he can relate so he knows uh
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya lah
ya lah so no matter what at the end of the day I still need to be with them
to see how they do like what you said lah give them maybe one month to try
if good enough then we can continue if not
ya
the fit lah sometimes it's not a good fit
like sometimes some of your your method
is more suited for a big classroom you in front of the class
ya
ya
ya K lah can we will
tell that to the
to the boy tomorrow
ah
okay lah so at least we have
so if let's say he okay

okay start
okay just
the slides all need to complete by by tomorrow lah I do not know whether have
enough time to complete by by tonight lah

for the help lah
mm
ya yup
not too familiar lah but okay
uh
okay
mm ya lah
okay so oh but what what he wants but why but why he wants so
oh okay
oh okay
mm
ya lah
not really
mm
oh okay
ah
I see
not really ah
so far was sam willows jer ah sam willows I I hear
and then after that
that's it lah
maybe err
sheikh haikel lah
maybe sheikh haikel music and maybe some
actually not really ah singapore band not singapore don't have
much
the malay group
ya
overseas the jam lah but those those err there's a few there's few groups those few groups that they did perform in singapore there is usually about one or two song but
not really that famous you know I have a few few friends that they they make
something along that line lah so they play at the you know the youth park
at behind orchard road there so they play at the youth park and then they
they jam one or two or three songs and then after that
that's it then that's their limelight lah
after that
most probably they just go back to their normal job lah
so they are not that famous lah
but
err but ya lah I mean
unlike those in america or maybe I don't know europe they usually they usually put the put at lot
mmhmm
ya lah the
but it was mostly malay songs lah malay songs
mm ya lah she's more more of a
like theatre
like those you know voice not not really a band kind
ya
ah fazil
nuradi is it nuradi
mm
huh who
uh not too sure
talent train ah
mm
ya
our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay lah but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
err the jokes are more for singapore centric lah not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that eh maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
mm
mmhmm
ya lah I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya and then they no lah they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya lah but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months what
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it
the talent show singapore idol
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh the voice ah sometimes like the voice lah
ya ah
ya
no lah the it's a draw what it's a draw
mm
ya lah I mean I mean he was trying to find
the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again ah where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again
so then you mean what he wants to join competition every two or three years then no point also what
they should start singing or get album I don't know you know
zoe tay is from my alma mater eh she was from yuan ching secondary
no she was way way way much my senior lah but
it's like the school very proud of her lah
yes of course
yuan ching
she wouldn't err declare
err she you know fanfare ah because yuan ching is not really that you know famous school unless you know she's from raffles junior college or what ah then then she'll flaunt it
yuan ching
yuan ching ya
I wanted to go but you you don't
amin
but now COVID don't have already lah
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already lah
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no lah most of them are retired already
I think somebody which
he's a bit a bit bald
eh ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression lah I mean
they they have to retire what once they they hit their sixties
have the energy lah
professorship
ya lah I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
yes
yes I'm millennial ah
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch lah
ah
ah ah
even my brother is millennial
my brother naz
so naz is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation lah
no she she got uh she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot lah but
but if she can if she can you know err ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya lah but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation lah I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made err
make a profit lah but the thing is if she
ya lah about one point one million lah but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
mm
how much she bought it
but her one is at simei right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand uh
thirteen years ago
mm
oh
oh okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand lah
huh
so just just
uh amber road
ah
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal lah because err
oh so new lah
well that's a risk
development
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya lah
but her place second floor
what one point
oh
her main bedroom
oh cause so it's quite big lah
ya okay but
uh huh
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
dasha when she can save more money right
mmhmm
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person what
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
mm
mm ah
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more what if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored lah then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means err in the embassy one is paying for her living space eh if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
I mean now okay lah maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya lah but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury uh apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense what
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people lah
say about thousand plus ah ya maybe ah
okay
if six person ya lah if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya lah make sense lah
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy lah one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy err is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya lah I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo lah so that
they are being sheltered lah
fixed condo
ah
ah
ya lah ya lah
mm mm ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they uh being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but err when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference ah cause
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes err what drives what drives people
mm
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
err flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
mmhmm
how much
ya that's quite a lot
oh eh so he's the degree lah
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
uh huh
oh okay
mmhmm
okay
uh huh
eton what's a eton
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore lah
oh
depend on the area lah depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese leh
he's err he knows err he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese err they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area lah maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence ah
mm
huh russia
but is it recognized or not in singapore
uh huh
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
oh malaysian malaysia hospital lah
oh okay and then then okay lah
ah
oh why ah
wasted kan
medicine also medicine what
oh
oh okay
eh oh err rundy rundy
rundy rundy
uh ireland or scotland ah
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand ah
four hundred thousand
mm
ya
mm
ya most I suggest
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait ah can remain thirteen fourteen
most of my friends
in singapore
mm
I think the highest I heard is jer lah
so not not easy
but in in in
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback ah
uh
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge ah
uh huh
ah ah
uh huh
I think ya lah because the the guys are not
no no the the
err secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
for the girls they
they're they're
ah because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which ah no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences ah
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
jordan
cairo
al-azhar lah
then
mmhmm
oh really
okay then
okay
how come it's like that ah
okay then how about
oh
if it's not recognize then because she she don't want to take
and then the the mother wants her to take right
but now after COVID after COVID she
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya that's actually quite
quite sad lah
cause the amount because there's some
ya I mean that's quite
unfair lah but
the amount of effort and they put
but in the end err she should've finish already right
uh why no good
egyptian arab spring arab
ya lah I mean
mm but
it's kind of sad lah that that wani that control all those things and then
let's say if if she's not recognise cannot get a good salary job then it's also quite
quite a pity lah but luckily the sister did land with parkway east which is quite good lah that you know
huh really
okay

well nevermind let her let her develop see which one she inclined to maybe she likes more sciences
depends lah in in the future we never knows because a lot of things also can can change one
but
how good is her
her maths err results
ya lah but her results shows that
I mean she's okay I mean not bad
but I think her malay is is better lah her malay is is picking up
ah
ah
ya but that one only when the all the ah
mm ya

err
ya
kan
in order ah so uh
like
keep up with the
academic lah
I ah
um
ya
how how how do I

code a scenario
that that the that the teacher given
then err must present
then
and then
and it must be the project must be err presented in
and the deadline lah
ya
no as as in like
err
and it like program ah like
they give you a a certain scenario where like
that like you have to
like the output must be
must be what they expect lah like example they give you a a
example they give you a table like a statistic they uh you have to use your your knowledge of
you have to use your knowledge of err programming that you have learnt during class and then you have to you have to in the input you have to quote in what you've learnt and then at the output right you it must be the the same as what they expect in the question in the scenario
err
ya
mm mm
mm
uh
uh
so I
they didn't
a prototype about
about a certain problem like for example
uh uh you have
you have problem with your earpiece like
like
you you have to wear earpiece where you
where your earpiece err wire always always like
like tangled so
so
we have to make a prototype to fix that problem lah oh okay that's good but because basically you you match your basic maths ah ya ya ya
ya ya
mm
err additional maths ah
they cannot
all cannot understand lah but
it takes practice ah

I have never
I always like
stay near the shore and then I don't go
uh further because I scared that

that's why I I I don't go
very very far from the shore

and me to the furthest part
uh furthest part that I've that I've went
dia
uh wait
like
he carried ya carried
uh
uh

I scared that I'll get lost
mm
ya
ya I I I really tried my best

for that time right I really
it's like a constant fear like I cannot overcome this fear of
of of swimming in deep parts
uh
like my I don't know lah my my heart
my heart is too weak
for
for me
like I like I I'm scared like
like I'm gonna drown or something
mm mm
uh uh
mm
ya
slowly gradually yes go
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya ya my fear is also height lah because
there was this
uh
sky walk in
uh I
for me there was a
there was a sky walk in camp
uh uh camp in in
when I was primary four there was a camp and then I have to participate in this uh
sky walk and then and then I took the longest time to finish the course because
cause it was really scary for me and then it was
really high
uh huh
mmhmm
mm
I
no I was I was
okay nice
thank you bye bye

wish eh
then for you
three months
oh like how is it
twice a week
ah not bad lah
oh you met the the mum
okay
ya lah
uh
mm
eh
right
oh okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you ah
but you guys haven't fought right okay lah
cause they say like you know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
oh
I think it will take a while lah
one year
K lah
um I think one year okay maybe six months ah
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
like
right ya so he is
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
mm
mm so
mm
mm
mm
oh
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
but does he know what he want to do
mm
mm mm
mm
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
mm
ya I mean take a risk ah if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
kan I mean that's what I would do lah
then um okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of ah
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly lah what kind of course he wants cause like
mm
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
oh okay okay
there's a master's in uh lasalle
uh err east asian studies
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
I think that it's okay lah like
cause if you just study jer kan
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy ah
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
mm
mm mm mm
okay two years ah
when
ya
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that lah I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your um
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet ah
but for you
mm
uh
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive kan then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare ah
oh
ya it is it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
tuas tuas
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
PayNow uh uh seh
clubhouse
okay
oh okay but it such a weird place lah to like get a get married at uh at tuas
ya I mean if you're up for pulau tekong kan
like I'm if you're if you're up for pulau tekong you're up for pretty much anywhere seh but I think you don't want sentosa right sentosa is too touristy for me
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
oh ya you just book the cruise lah you just get one cruise uh uh
then you get married in the on the water
uh
uh uh seh
like like go all out lah
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
uh mocktail lah mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine
uh huh
oh nice ya we should go there I wanna go there
oh okay okay okay
mm
ya I know
okay so like what do you guys get
uh uh
brunch menu mm
mm
okay lah best lah
mm
mm
mm
then you barbecue yourself or what
oh K
oh K K ya lah like buffet lah then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
mm ya ya ya
eh but no barbecue pineapple is nice
oh
oh because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly lah I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
aww it tasted like meat ya
mm
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
even when it was um
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
take them afterwards after the first one
um
ah seh or you can go with us lah like me and uh me and hafiz so you as in
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also lah then at least there's some a bit of
mm
mm
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay lah so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that lah obviously
really ah
like
how how bad is it
it is
they had like the music
err show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
mm
mm
uh
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover seh
like even
if they they recover like if johor is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
to get back up
ya
if
ya like I think like
ya
mm
mm
ya
like from what it looks they are not
ya india is like one of the worst I think
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
uh uh
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it lah
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck ah ah cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
mm
ya
ya
uh uh
ya ya ya
mm
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad ah
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
ah luck luckily like mm I alighted much like err quite fast lah so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
uh
uh huh
ya
ya
mm
ya
uh
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit uh
uh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
uh huh
mm
mm
okay
uh
okay
uh
uh and just be aunties lah
ya ya ya ya
mm mm
uh uh seh
uh uh
ya
mm
ah ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like oh my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to ah ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
ya december twenty nineteen
mm
that's why then I'm like also like
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm how how their conditions were right
oh my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
uh
uh
uh
mm
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb jer ah cause no choice kan ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order ah law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then err some people made a a like sarcastic kind of err remark it's like err go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this one they say go to hospital because they found out like
uh
uh
that time ah
ya ya
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like err you you don't you can't transmit anything lah so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work seh
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more leh then I'm like oh my goodness
uh
this kind of like way to combat right uh uh it's like I read it I cannot forget seh then I keep telling people then people like
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous

I've been doing well lah actually what about you
wah actually it was not bad leh like uh at first
uh I thought like I'll have a lot of problems but actually it was quite smooth
Law and Literature so ya very interesting
then uh you in what school now
a'ah
oh so uh what course
oo that's interesting
mm
mm
mm
true
then
mm
um floorball
ya it's a very interesting sport
oo then what type of sport do you prefer then
mm
mm
hmm
alamak
eh
mm
mm
then
mm
it's a unique course I would say
ya and err this course is like it appeals to me lah because I also I really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and I
mm
oo so
oh so recently I just uh finish my semester one so some of the courses I sorry I mean modules I picked was
I did was uh design and colour so I do like graphic designs and stuff and I also uh besides coding I also learn uh concept
oo that's not bad
yeah that's poly life man like most of the time you are just like spending time with your friends doing project work
internship eh
oh
true
oh
oh
wah
like during that that test
oh right
mm
oh
that's that's interesting I think you will do very well lah
yeah
don't worry I think with all the skills you are equipped with confirm you
ah
mm
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally uh do uh my hobbies
yeah
yep
go for the trials err because I um I'm actually afraid of rejection
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then um so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
wah how was it
yeah
oh for what
oh
mm
ah
yeah
mm
oh
wow
ya man I can't imagine myself
wah all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
then
uh other than
then right you you said that you had your I mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so uh how
oh
yeah
I
eh then oh
eh you go first
ya
yeah
yeah
ah small business
no no no you you meant ah calligraphy is it
oh yeah yeah
yeah eh
mmhmm
ih
oo
wah wah tell me more
yup
list them all
oh
oh
ya ya Gold Coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
true
ya
ya
ya true true
wah for me right
yes
figurine so I was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
wah I tell you I'm biggest procrastinator eh with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator I I like let's say like
oh
mm
ya uh me also like most of the time is always like cause I
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
uh it can be done but it's just very hard
my course is interaction design kan so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm uh ideas together and then come up with like uh a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting lah because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
uh how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
ya that's about it
for you eh
mm
why kay you tell me
how rabak
wah I legit also don't like this type of people leh like they really make my blood go up eh like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to ah take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works lah
mm
oh
oh I know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
oh
oh that's interesting
ah ya ya
mm
oh that's good that's good
yeah
oh
ya
I think I think it's a it's a good app ah because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our Singaporean society cause like I feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good um for me I think your app is very beneficial lah for people yeah
oo that's good
ya ya ya very interesting eh
mmhmm
mm
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game
wah
that's cool
mm
wah
ya ya ya very interesting
oh
oh
ya
mm
mm
ya ya
mm
and what are some of the
the like
oh ya
ya
wah actually I make friends very instantly eh it's like ya because err okay the good thing about technology is that err
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school lah so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online

kan like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young lah so the thing is like he's err like professor in this like
like um over the years kan they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like ah people who are like basically like
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met ah through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
um you know like straightaway
like realise eh tomorrow you gonna get married this person
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world lor
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing lah that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool kan I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker lah don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
oh
oh ya you told me what
oh ya ya the cafe thing then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
oh
wah
oma spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
farrer park ya but the thing is
very circular
actually ya
uh huh
like tough what
but you know
ya but it's not
ya
eh
ya
maybe you are just like picky
tea without sugar can but coffee oh because of the bitterness kan
it's just weird
K lah okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
you can fulfil lah okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so um out of these three kan like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay lah have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
lee kuan yew no ah is it you can be rich I can't remember
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know what
what
okay I think that's a bit far oh
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
mmhmm
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries lah our neighbouring countries lah
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries lah if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore ah no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
like you know
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun kan
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case lah
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot lah hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national railway railway is eh you know the train one
oh my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay lah um
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
no but maybe maybe because like
what you doing there huh uh you never read the sign is it
eh ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like oh my god
like ah like the maid was shocked lah when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya because it's okay lah but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
um you need to
like you can achieve now lah I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy lah to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
huh
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and uh cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia ah and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya lah but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave account
post secondary ah
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya
so can use that
err if it there's one country my wish list lah
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young lah I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like naruto like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing lah last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly naruto come in ya ah pokemon all this you know and then I was like
oh my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
wah
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like osaka kyoto tokyo
and I when nara I went like kanazawa then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no lah I went with my friend but I went um I think I went hiroshima alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter eh wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing lor
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like tokyo and osaka they rarely snow I think
tokyo ya tokyo rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
oh you didn't know I went korea oh my god
I showed you ya
oh my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only ah it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have ah thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no lah I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
wei you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition mah
ya
no lah um I think K because
most of them lah actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so uh it's their first language lah english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
um you know the seoul tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya wei you didn't know I went all these wah it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also lah that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper what
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in temasek my microsoft
korea bought my bags mah
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
ya
oh you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
huh
I feel like going with your friend kan
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went batam with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like oh no I cannot eat it's oh no like this place is
but then he was like then ya and then he was like why why the hotel smell then I'm like
hotel supposed to smell that way you know
and then we went massage right ya like yes then he was like why is the machine like so weak
I'm like
if you are not paying for that full package you know you are paying like twenty dollars for that you know
no I guess not I think
oh ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage lah
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment err one star price then I was like
alamak why you like that
and then um
then then I was like
ya then okay
so okay how about you which country you would like to go
korea
I I'm looking at cause you cannot run what unless you wanna join like fun did you
but korean got nothing much though
eh yo yo america
there's so many things
okay lah but
but you've been to europe turkey was in europe
ya but it is europe
it it they are part of europe
they look you know you know you went to like turkey and then there's they have like the greece infrastructure and everything it looks exactly the same
you know right like you the whole europe have that same infrastructure that you see
ya
but europe is
I think for me is quite boring unless you go like paris
um
yes sightsee
drink coffee
no drink tea you don't like coffee
then you should go you will afal
I think afal entertain you
ya right he will entertain you like
cause of school what you also will be busy next year after you know I don't know it depends where you go
business lah like it's the safest choice
ya
just don't go science
I don't know I think it's
ah nursing
like really nursing
why though
no but the thing is like you know ah inshira
you call her what ah christina or inshira
huh
then I saw his ah her she say very stressful
iskandar also in nursing what
ya
a'ah
no but
very difficult
ya
but it depends lah if you think it's fulfilling then you should go for it
no but it's not easy
but it's stable
it's stable income but there's no progression though
like ya but it's
no I think you shouldn't go nursing eh
but okay lah malinah
did nursing mah she's doing quite well
which one
huh
I wasn't
ya only I know ah only know of malinah cause she's my age
you think she's you think she's older

I don't like I'm opposite of you
ya lah just like everybody in our family
ya same
you know you can you're just not used to it
no but since young you always scared to order I keep asking you guys to order like afal and you
you talk with gibberish you just talk stupid stuff

real friends
so it yesterday they are not real

huh she's paying fine
like really fine
huh
ya but you will care about money soon enough really
like what
oh
ya but
oh I get it like she's
doing something in your life

wah
oh that's nice
I like beef boat noodles
oh ya we've been to thailand also
you went with your friends
only oh chey I thought

I know I know they have that like they have that malaysia mah but malaysia one super cheap it's like one ninety ringgit eh
ya
I also never tried before
no but you have to know that they are old

nonsense lah
okay so
ya
K K K
then last okay okay it's like oh my god it's almost like one hour eh K maybe okay we ask one last question K one last question time to sleep

if you were born rich okay if you were born rich singapore
then okay what question you wanna ask do you have any question you wanna ask
ya
what that's so random
no ah we're talking what
you know what but it you cannot do like it's in singlish ya that's why then confirm fail what if you do this kind ya
so it's different ya
so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya I know
I know
ya
interesting lah
like ya
but I think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other kan
ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between kan ya
mmhmm
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a suria actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
mmhmm
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no lah like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya
ya I didn't expect
him
except for me
I never use
ya
the only time I actually use that day was to watch
no ya big bang and then after that I was like oh my god I found a website like no no not not no err because like I my friend bought the whole
I think ya the whole box then my friend give me lend me lah then I watch everything finish then I stopped watching already because the only reason why I watch Netflix is because of that
ya unless I won't use it so actually I wanted to subscribe I tell you ah like I just want to try so I actually could just use the one month free or was it three months but then in the end never lah then you guys all use free I never rely on anyone lah ya I very independent
you know I have always been independent not like you guys isn't it true
huh
ya I know
why
no but the air cooler
but it's not even cold

but then I will clean it up at the end of the night
ya
like it makes me happy to clean
therapeutic
ya
oh
wah
ya oh my god okay
so late
still early

okay we can start talking now ah so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also
oh ya ya
I don't think it was part of the rediscover thing I don't know the whole list isn't out yet right

just to be safe ah
job finding not so good lah still finding hundred plus going to two hundred jobs already rejected funny thing even temporary job also they don't want what to do
then
ya my career futures is a lot of
mendaki have opening but that time they wanted someone with a degree of sociology
ya
it's good full time already now
true lah but okay lah
but it's okay lah crowne plaza now got staycation package mah next time he come over then you can stay staycation package use up the one hundred dollar voucher
mama wants to go for that actually
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook mah mama can cook
but she eat ramen all that
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest
we had a question what is what was the most memorable meal you've had and where did you have it sad to say it was on the qatar flight I agree

ya
I I I I'm young at heart
obviously I didn't go through with it

and then after that finished no money already cause I spent it all on new zealand
mm
there there will be a tattoo of a
ya the the the japanese wave shit then after that it's always like a koi fish going up and then after that the koi fish is at the forearm
seriously I
why do you think I saved up money for three years when I wanted to get tattoo
I don't know ah depends on the quality one ah
obviously I I I didn't do much research ah I didn't want a koi fish tattoo I wanted a pirate one
you know it will be like like
huh
wah
ask her to do an apprenticeship ah
what the fuck
man
I wouldn't I don't I wouldn't trust myself sia
cuppin
the one you bought after you exercise
ah ya ya ya
uh huh
woo
oh that's cool
eh
ah cause
because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast lah
ya
I almost got a tattoo there
no I was planning it
and then after that just when we were there he
so and then
so I was like fuck it ah like
and when you come back we talk about it
then after I googled do
do tattoos affect your kidneys then they said like oh if you want to donate a kidney you shouldn't get a tattoo then I was like ah fuck ah
ya
ya
no lah she know lah uh
I I stayed over at her friend's house of course she know
no
it's just
me
like I
ya I mean
one time I literally passed out
on the living room
yeah
I don't know ah
I I know at one point she she she didn't
yeah
ya never again though
yes
throwing up
no
yeah
ya
ya I did it was like one of the first few conversations we had
cause she asked about halal haram ratio
then I said oh ya I I I used to drink a lot and stuff
ya
cause she said
ya uh I stopped already so okay lah that doesn't bother her
that kind of thing like that
ah
what
ya then happened like three
in the same night
and then after that
no I don't I don't remember
ya
that as
ya and then one time
then after that
then after that you know like they dance very close one
then my friends were behind me then they were like egging me on
that one I remember
I I was so angry at myself sia
ya
I mean I feel kind of bad but
also kind of
good
ya
how is it how was your last duty you get into trouble or not
surprising
uh huh
mmhmm
ah
ah okay
action sia
I
oh
ah
hand over shift
reservist
actually not really lah I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
mm
mm
night shift I wasn't like that ah because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning kan
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning kan
ya
last time my rota quite bonded ah
ah that's like fucking eight bicycle sia
mm
oh ya how was it cardiac arrest right
ah
cannot sia
mm
dah expect ah
mm
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
ah
mm depends ah depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
oh
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
oh
why sia
ya ya ya
all medics
my time it was like optional
they expect you to go
mm
ah
that's cool
the this captain from
err division yishun
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
so ya
oh ya my last
you know my err last duty
eh no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
then they but the I think it's because
ya it's like
pretty much lah but most of the time we still try ah just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare ah unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing lah
to do that kind
ya
then he was like like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay what actually last time medic
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
ah
ya
err they started right after I
as in
ya that's true
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
so I think like the
orh firefighter
orh then turn out for
orh
ya
the firefighting ah
like the the green the green one
ah ah
T shirt sia
ah ah ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya that's what I saw also ah when I turn out with them
but fun right
mm
eh wait so were you were you the covering sec com
orh so even then like if even if you turn out the will take charge lah
ah so so if anything like the will take charge of the call lah
what
ah ya
oh then
ah I see I see
ya
orh they want to put people into the
ah
eh but actually now also turn out for
also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is ah high intensity
ya let me google ah high intensity
high performance high performance
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol
so it's like
eight eight people do
ya so it's it says here
eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance to resuscitate a patient
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
make it better
I I also don't know
that kind of thing but ya
I heard they was like they were starting to do it
quite often relatively often
serious
mm
then you suay ah
eh but ons
oh
sian hopefully your next cycle gets better
what the fuck
workload and the
uh huh
if and turn out at the same time then how
orh okay
oh
oh
it's like you turning out for two appliances
mm
and
face something new
ya fun right
mm you you've seen how it works already ah
mm
mm
I I guess I get what you mean ah but it's been a long time since I felt that ah
ah like I never
last time I remember they they ask us to download when I was in then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download
then after that I think it was during like our talk or something like that
sir I off duty for what want to go collapse then we were like sia lah I mean I know everyone was thinking it ah but you don't have to say it bro
ya
mm
ya you download already ah
the my responder app

that oh you take this course you finish this refresher course we will give you your
certification
then it's like it only last two years
ya
they said we supposed to get the card also
to say that we are actually certified
ya
err
the only thing
is like we get tested on it like the contract indications and what not
like our our depth of compression the rate of compression that kind of thing
then if you pass then you will get by right supposed to get the cert ah
ya
but they never give us the card ah
ya
ya sia ya I remembered the the first medical thing I ever learned

you know
ya you feel like you doing it's like worthwhile of your time
exactly ya
it's like sia lah I could have been sleeping for like another thirty minutes but instead I have to watch away this dumbass who is not even like sick or anything
then after that he said he ingested something so we like
then I was like huh
it's like some police I remember
then he say I I I swallowed coins
then I asked him
what coins then he was like

ya we were on the ya we were on scene already
like the the call text
ya
got new ones ah
after you
ah okay
mm
whoa
ah ah
mm mm
shit
yours
yeah I think yours is creepier
mm but still
like the imagery's around
fuck you ah
ya you know you're going back there for reservist right sooner rather than later
tomorrow um
my friend's getting married in january then I'm one of her bridesmaids
ya
cause like we like the part of the bridal party mah
ya ya ya
and then after that
then twelve O'clock like one of my friends booked like
they got like some viewing or some shit
and then
one thirty
I need to go send amira for her flu vaccination
chao keng pe
uh huh
mm
wah then how the hell you survive your sia
weren't you in the sun every day in bunker gear
oh

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
oh have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction lah television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
uh the other twin his ukrainian
um she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised uh she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress uh tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
um uh who is one of the clones lah
then she always uh live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming uh compared to season two and season four
mm I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones uh usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this lah
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember lah because this is the current show I'm watching now
um
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it lah so you won't get err you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil lah because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended uh without spoiling it for you
err I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes uh actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's uh probably safe to check out ah because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
oh okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout lah
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse uh them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like uh draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you lah I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your uh interview outfit
um don't need tie ah I guess err maybe just a formal wear including uh smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive uh and also be open lah
a'ah
mm
okay
oh I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's ah creepier and more real it's um it's not is not a comedy like orange orange kan orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent ah ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for uh uh why you like
oh um I mean for me err I'm waiting for money heist uh wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons ah
ya ah ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya uh my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show uh I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
oh ya
mm
ya ya
oh so you think you like a professional critic ah
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about uh about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident uh raquel losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real lah if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season uh but it was very entertaining to me ah also quite compelling and way better in spanish um ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
uh uh the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this uh money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions ah but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated lah anyway so today is twelve twelve uh sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full uh a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
mm I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at uh ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of uh sneakers on sale
mm
I am looking for air fryer
uh
no I'm busy mm I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding ah strider balance bike for azam
second
uh carousell so I found one uh uh that can deal at buangkok but uh he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
oh okay lah why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay lah firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand uh second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but uh the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly lah
it depends on his father's uh interests and free time
ya so have you thought about azri's suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
uh if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in uh government sector uniform group like uh prison service uh um I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive eh but you need to read more lah you need to do more research uh but there's bond lah I think err since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this uh uniform group then you should uh still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself ah that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
uh I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya mm
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
oh so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
uh their degree are sponsored by the company ah ya I mean like for example um
mm
so rolls royce pay for his degree
oh that's good so uh as he get as he ah got the degree right so did his salary also uh goes up went up
oh okay that's good can I ask what is his position
oh okay five years eh mm so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his uh recommendation do you don't you want to work there
oh okay okay
mm interesting rolls royce okay
oh so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him lah you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so wah when he joined what was his uh education uh certificate diploma so so he join uh it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant uh then he gets to stay there with his family
mm ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house lah well that's good that's good so so he so he's uh he told you that he signed bond for five years with uh
five years okay so uh is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree oh okay I think uh singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face ah
oh it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but ah but who will pay for this uh school the company or the company will reimburse
oh that's good
if you have to stay until the company
mm that means err work and study ah ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
oh really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good um
okay so all the best to you
so about this mark guy so exactly what he say so err for a wait
when when did when did I said err when err I send you send that resume to him then he replied on the same day send to him so that's a via whatsapp okay then um
then after that there's no use for me ya okay then how about your friend that is connected to him
okay
okay what degree you want
mm so what she working as now oh searching
almost a year so until now no job
oh okay so did she graduate from or
okay okay I see then maybe you can just wait for this mark guy cause normally they will take a week so one week has pass right ya so uh maybe monday can email him just to ask what's the status then uh then can just move on lah
anyway
so uh what's the status about your bike
uh the so when is it going to change the
uh cover set what's the plan
yes
okay so meaning still need to do something to the bike so this time is engine not the exhaust okay both so the mechanic still in process me ah in a way he grew there
okay very good
uh okay um good to hear ah hopefully it will not extend beyond january
okay why to bring the bike to go where
fireworks ya so um
what's the plan for you and your hundred dollar voucher actually
so
okay ya ya they have to queue for more than four hours at uh orchard hotel
where you know about this
oh okay okay someone like review
what hotel is that do you know
oh okay concord um it's quite old anyway um so about this uh we were talking about your job right so you're you graduated with uh diploma in engineering correct engineering informatics so pretty much is engineering lah okay like azri's job
uh like ah azri's job um that one is more to or engineering
mostly it's engineering electrical rovers
okay
oh assistant engineer ah
mmhmm
oh is it
your friend
ya
uh any particular companies that you are eyeing for
tivo ya
okay so do you know if they are hiring
maybe you just get the email then can just drop her an email if it's the same person lah
mm okay okay then um
so that means you just mentioned just now uh how about okay it also open right
so is that something that you can see yourself doing oh okay okay
okay okay okay so depends on what is it lah ya also not choosy right for now okay that's good then so for uniform group okay that's good okay um okay let's see
err then how about those kind of factories that need like uh uh engineer assistant engineer like seagate far my my or my friend would just be our house and his is just five minutes away from ah so that's okay also ya
so that's okay also
engineer or oh okay

but now you know grab you have to be careful
oh like me
then
mm
so did he get caught or not
she say it's ridiculous ah
ya but it's not about that they're now the new thing is the trend that is rising is so let's say you deliver to uh house A ah so the customer accept already

uh um
um
uh
um
err ya then err
ah ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
oh yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get um
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad err cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it um ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
uh any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but um
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back uh just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it um even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but um maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me err excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not um just buy err knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya err just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that um which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work um then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes ah okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then uh you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say err when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss johor so much our old house ya but now it's um make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it ah abu
oh it's a terrace oh okay
yup because ah it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and err I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun lah ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase abu
sticky sambal I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's uh it's whatever happens um
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
um because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper what I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger ramly burger ramly that I miss the most yup and the abalone
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of err cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to cause
yup err sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go johor and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that abu
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
mm I think so
um ah we went to cycling um
ah we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge err you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
ah and we tried um tried their ah that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it uh you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say abu like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
um yes because I was um for my I was from
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
um I think it's
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
oh wait I can't um
oh actually I think I didn't went um
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or uh high elements in um school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay um my camp was at the pulau ubin there ya
um I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the uh I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore um ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to um rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
um you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
um I remember um
I can't um in secondary school we did a lot of things
um like uh like camps mostly camps
err give I remember um chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days uh and then what else oh err it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time uh in our secondary school um we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
um cause we had we change our principal I um our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they uh do uh about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
um ya
and all of them all of these charities err will be donated to the uh respective
respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs lah for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that uh you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy err to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games ah and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you err I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
uh plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
mm ya and we have a lot of programmes lah actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme um like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed um how the way how they speak
we and their english ah the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that um I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup err from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them lah ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type lah actually um but ah for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you err like example for me uh I was given a choice to go to I I did wish to go to poly but ya is also like poly but
err
like I in is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like um ya um
it's like school also but no ah I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
um
sports there's a lot ah actually ya and yup oh to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves lah like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
um doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my err using my skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school uh we didn't have like workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs lah like you have to make err you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically err and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking um
because I I cause why I choose that course is um I I I want to learn how to uh bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
um pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun lah to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
oh um okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot um okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made um I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or financier focaccia and it's a great um
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made err the pizza it um and we also make cakes um black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could err redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if ah even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like uh you have to cut it into threes uh three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and err after err the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling err at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
oh okay I remember um we didn't make okay err I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is pate choux in french and then you know uh we had to do eclaire choux so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like uh cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my err my class advisor though
um my sir showed us uh a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who uh they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed lah like they have really nice talents to um which I can also learn from them
ya
oh my lecturer name my err we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really err sir jeremy is a very nice uh teacher he
the uh he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our uh parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him uh he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who err
which teacher doesn't want to see their children uh their I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud like a very proud like err like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
um
do you mean during COVID nineteen
um I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
um this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows err appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does uh when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause uh because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because example lah like um
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross lah
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know err in restaurants last time was like uh you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the um the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like um um
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
um I know wearing a mask it will it will helps um to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face lah example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to um get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen uh to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like um it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know
um
ya and but now when going out you need to always ensure you have your mask
wear a mask I I once forgot like I was like went out for I went out then I was like something was missing
and then I was looking around like oh ya it was my mask I had to rush back and get back my mask which is the struggle and oh and I was oh I was rushing to school ya
and you know wearing a mask is also a nice it can be good and bad and also be good because that you can cover your I mean you can cover your face
for those people who are introvert and does not like to speak and doesn't like show your face mask wearing mask is a good thing cause people can't recognize you that's what I like about wearing mask
ya mm but it's hard to breathe sometimes and ah ya
mm I don't know lah like
I don't know as long I can survive I do what I can maybe learn just keep on learning thing new things and all ya
um so abu um
so how ah I heard that you went on on a holiday I mean you went on a staycation with your friend

forget it lah
you bought it how much and you want to sell so low
why don't you wear it then while waiting for people to buy

ya but you didn't have this is japanese brand you didn't even try
usually what I do is I will give all the sizes then they know from there
it is recording
mm half
err like that lah you know lah
like I when I buy the shoes for the kids right

just that singapore don't have that

he refuse to do it because he says is a holiday
no lah didn't sort
I don't know
I don't know
I didn't give that mindset what like last time also holiday is like finish up the
um
assessment book that kind but the thing is right um
she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like um
uh
oh like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like hey I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like huh maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
okay okay and uh
that's usual lah cause ilan was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you what
timetable kan
like like she can even ask me like when I said
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
eh err one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me err is it err minus or plus
ya ya ya that kind of thing
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff lah
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her ah
is like
ya lah the one he didn't show us right so anyway when I read I read that
he
I felt that he wrote it slightly differently lah formally but
to me
I don't know maybe malay the standard is not high so
he keeps missing out punctuation marks
frankly speaking now that you ask me I don't even remember the english but I remember the malay
he just
punctuation marks I don't know why
I feel like he should there should be a writing camp you know like drill them to writing and then like learn a lesson
okay

ya
the only time I went there is the scholarship lah but
it's so far
um

last stage ya
ya

I'm fine thank you
how's your family
ah
ya second one is a boy right
oh I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
oh
uh I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it um you might know them because some of them are our former ah schoolmates
oh you're into baking now wah that's nice wah must try some of your cake soon ah
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
ah movie but ah during this pandemic kind of hard lah because I think with the crowd control and all
wah netflix and chill ah
err I don't know uh only so far only a few have confirmed but uh
I will update you ah on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can lah uh
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
ah
um but is it too young for them to start
um going to tuition at this age she's only six years old kan
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that err everyone is competing uh so
it's
it has its pros and cons ah like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
ya but
slowly lah but surely uh I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important lah they just try their best lah
and
I I do have other maybe uh I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
oh oh
orh okay okay I understand I can ask for you lah then
err we'll see what we can arrange
err
wah you sit down at coffeeshop ah I thought you atas one
oh you you full time housewife ah
good lah
actually it's better for to me lah personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
um like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore err I think err
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive ah then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day uh some owners also like abuse their maid lah so that's not right lah I feel
ya there's uh the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse ah think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news lah but you just have to be updated lah now with the
COVID nineteen ah I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that lah before they are cleared to do cleaning oh mm
oh must take care of your health now lah
like but I think if now if you go to any
uh I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya lah for those who are working lah they will give you like
to check on yourself
err so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ah
uh alhamdulilah so far
I'm okay lah maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest uh because of work ah
um politic lah then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what uh
safety measure measurement at work mm cause yes
now currently we have this installation uh of doraemon at the national museum it's interesting lah but
unless I'm there lah then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
ah
uh
uh claim it
oh usually you go to johor ah and do your shopping
I think so far our government has done well lah to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
mm
oh
ah so it's like
uh they have different sizes lah and
uh they cater also for kids
mm
mm
ya true
ya
ya but surprisingly
I think they are currently
preparing ah for phase three to roll out but ya lah depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert lah it's important lah for us to be on alert
ah foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
mm
ya lah
mm
you know
stay home notice ya
and I think uh for those who are coming in I think
uh they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure ah I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required lah eh even when they come in they have to do the swab test lah
ah
ya thankfully
a
mm yes yes
uh I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the uh the conduct the test
was mm asked to leave I think he got a job as a security lah err and considered is also a high risk because err he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm uh
but actually they're paying quite
high lah is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that lah because they don't want to
be in contact ah ya don't want to be exposed to this uh and even when he he's finished his job think he ask uh his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can uh remove his clothes outside his house uh ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace lah so it's just an
additional steps ah precaution ya
ah
ya you see
ah so it's not easy ah it's quite
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
a few cartons eh I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe lah
got some quality is not that good ah
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask ah
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but
no lah I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last lah err for a few months then but you have to
wash lah I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse lah
mm
err according to the
safety measurement I think
mm
ya can okay lah that's an idea but
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
mm
ah three kan mm
mmhmm
mm
feels also quite sad lah for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something ah but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad lah but it's better than not having no job and all lah ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya lah
ya lah it's tiring lah even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now uh doing grab but grab is also affected err think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he uh took back the car ya but still it's not doing well lah he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental uh
to the family lah
mm true lah I think
the government implementing a lot of err help for those
need them ah they also I think they have set up this um united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need lah ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march ah I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya lah things will get better lah think I think for singaporean ah they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases ah that can affect us
prata
uh there's a prata at sin ming I think it's quite nice it's run by a family uh father and a son
can can um
can ah maybe I want to try eat the briyani ah
the briyani is quite nice ah I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best ah
err what do you want to order I help you order
the briyani or the prata coin is also nice
and it's
I think just the right
taste ah
can
uh I think I eat briyani with uh fried chicken lah mm because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking ah
then what drinks do you want
teh peng teh peng
teh with ice eh
ya but I think is not that good to always drink teh with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better lah at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health err and also see what eat we eat
ah and also see what we eat
okay
can
uh
anything else
wah there's a lot of people in the queue
ya
digital
uh you order lah since you are very good using app
um briyani chicken
ya fried chicken
mm
ah yes
oh so we have to pick up or
oh okay oh that's
ya I understand but err I volunteered with err an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food err to buy groceries so that they will minimize err their movement outside ah so they can actually err contact us and have like medication
uh you can buy for them and then send it to their homes um
ya lah I think it's a long way to help our seniors uh
because I think if they are exposed to this I think um probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is uh I think done by government agencies ah they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors uh so that they will not be exposed much ah so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies ah then we will be there to send groceries medication uh food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer lah through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask eh for more information lah ya
um
free ah
mm
ya
communication
is
mm
mm
ya lah
data
mm
oh the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort ah to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal ah
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya think
when it gets better I think we have to follow the
safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide lah
ah
the social distancing ah
mm
mm
ah social distancing ambassador
mm
ah

and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay lah one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
huh
huh
I don't understand
mm
mm I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no lah in singapore first lah
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya lah what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and uh basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya lah with the money then I will do that lah
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills what and then the cats I rescue them and then what feed them what
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya lah
cause I will invest also what so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
a non-profit organisation
huh
uh uh I cannot lah
volunteer ah
then you get to play with the cats sia so cute
bring lah
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya sia like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside
and then if you found the abandoned kitten never
then never tell
eh then nevermind lah they can be bubbles and more what
why socks
no but it doesn't fit
the kind of names that you want
blossom
what do you mean brighter cat

like she told me about the possibility of the
okay err
okay nevermind let's switch topic first since like
we cannot talk about it now
um
mm
but what
oh ya I wanted to say
I feel like
papa has sense like
huh your friend can see
what kind of places
no
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
you saw
then
mm
mm
mm mm
mm mm
and then
and that's why I thought I said that
cause his family also like
his side
if I'm not wrong
ya lah
when I as I grow up and then I try to understand all these different cultural practices then I'm like ya
we cannot be like so dismissive
when there is a possibility of it
mm
ya you'll never know sia
and he's not that like great also
no but I really think that he did send something for us since he like cannot be around us
I think
I think
I think
I think these are all signs of
delusion
adui
I don't know ah
oh but sorry maybe you cannot be his wife
diam
ee you wish
you wish sia
ya sia
no but
making some decisions that I will regret
why he staring at me
why why do you look so sad
but I will buy the graduation gown for them
and then I'm going to do the photoshoot cause I already sign up for this photoshoot package
siala it's been like a year
and I still haven't go
and then uh you can bring like family there's like uh
your family members can come and like take photos
so they will give you like don't know what size and then they will give you the softcopy and then if you want to blow it up to a bigger one
like poster or what you can do that
but
like leceh ah like I don't feel like taking also cause I look so fat
so ugly
but if only I can bring buttercup and blossom as well
do you want to take pictures with me do you want to go for a photoshoot baby
hmm do you want to go for a photoshoot
eh so cute because on Shopee I saw like some pet costume it's like
a graduation gown and then with the mortarboard siala how cute would they be sia
oh

I don't think so uh even if they sell it'll be like bloody expensive
yup so you gonna graduate with me buttercup since you have been studying with me all along
my god buttercup
why
it's okay everything's gonna be fine
no we know azizi what
but I really feel like his family practices all these nonsense
ya
with papa's side I know it's like the feeling is like damn strong
I think he has the ability to practise all of these
no fuck no
no freaking way
no
don't want to learn
ya and then go to hell after not like as if I'm not going to hell also
why would why would you put yourself in a position where people want to like disturb you
ee
siala I think it's much easier to just kill you seh
only akmal wants to get near to you
ee
ee
and you want to live in a farm
and you want to be
your head
they will feed you dog meat
oh well I'm not being racist I'm just being stereotypical
eh in a very joking manner
I don't judge them I judge what I read
from the internet
no no but there are some of them who are very nice
like the like the shi</mandarin that I worked with
I didn't judge them
I'm judging you
siala if
ee please ah
so what's that sound
ee siala I'm pretty sure the person listening to this recording is like
they will like Google you because they have your full name and then they realise siala this girl is she as pretty as she makes her out to be and then they Google you and then they realise err in the image search is like
and then the person will be sending things to you then
ya lah send you a
hello
send you a mirror
hais I'm so tired
ya lah
nope no more makeup can save you
if I'm the doctor I'll just give you an overdose of anaesthesia so you just die
eh
ee
siala
so classic grandeur sia
ya but this is grandeur
that is not big dreams
this is delusions
okay I know I will send you things
and then when I finally work there I will see you there
I don't want to counsel you too
I don't dare lose my job
and I can't counsel you anyway it's unethical
that's not big dream
that was the first question I ever asked
ee siala
yup
I'm not saying fat chicks are not pretty
there are some that is pretty
no
the aqilah
uh
and then this one spilling ya literally is mama's body probably ugly sia then I keep telling myself
it's not exactly underwear also what
what it's true
so that's why I'm watching what I
huh
what
ya lah you one meal is like
cause I just ate and now I'm so hungry again
nobody eats briyani with egg
and briyani
ee
it even overpowers buttercup's will to want to steal my food also
ya I know but ee
then
oh ya
huh
horror
no
no
eh annoying seh
no
um
if she's born with that voice siala
I know
but like if she's born with that voice and then she eats wasabi and then
it change
then she just lost her her unique selling
point of her acting
nasally
nasal
ya it's how you project yourself and you carry yourself and how you present yourself
yes
but it's fucking painful lah
ah
err
ya they will break your shin I think
I don't know but I read in the news that time this girl
she did her
ya she she did that because she want she wanted to be a an air stewardess
you're not that small
mm
she care what
she wants to be taller but what to do
mm
mmhmm
but it doesn't work what
mm mm
so so you want cancer or you want to uh as in do you want to be tall

ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay what is it
ya
oh
so this will be your third wish lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
the first thing I'm thinking about being rich of course everybody think about being rich right
because being rich you don't need to even think about like uh
you got momey problem anything right because you already rich what
you if you like like what you say become a billionaire right once I become a billionaire I'm also going to buy a house a car
for um
is benefit for myself and my family lah
so we can bring whole family go shopping together ha
car is actually benefit for us to go everywhere lah
when you got a big family right it's much easier
ah rather than now that we having difficulties okay like emergency we want to go
anywhere also we need to book a grab at least if we got our own car at least we can drive
straightaway and bring
I mean like something happen uh we can bring our parents or maybe we can bring our siblings or
touch wood lah eh if anybody
ah emergency at least we got car
we can drive straightaway to the hospital
ah so we can save for the ambulance money so we don't need to pay the ambulance at least we save the money so once you think about money ha
everything about money lah eh
because although once you being rich you still think about money ah that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
uh stable financial eh
ride their own bicycle to school ah kan
so from there also safe you see everything think about money eh
I already think very far lah kan
ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
then after that
ah you say that you read about the news kan
ah but like what
two months' time right about two months' time so okay lah not bad lah
so why not then
so at least if we can use that uh one hundred uh dollar voucher lah
we can save up money save up some money lah
to buy our own food cook our own food so we just picnic
mm
uh huh
mmhmm
ya correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
um you know that uh
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
ah they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you lah
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest uh maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso kan
mm so like that better right
mm
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
err
ya lah marina is nice ah
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
splash
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think that one is quite cheap also
because um that time I saw a youtuber
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this lah
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
ah
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
ah so maybe we can go for that one ah
mm so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you ah so we no need to go for separate rooms what
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk ah
cannot gathering ah cannot make side illegal gathering
ah cannot gossip ah
so at least at least lah mm so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
have lah
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle ah I not sure
but they can uh ride on the bicycle right
they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride ha
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part lah that we can do
ah
maybe we can plan saturday morning
mm no maybe afternoon
oh ya because actually we don't want
um
we don't want
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
mmhmm
the next morning we go cycling
oh over there if I not wrong got burger king eh
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin ah
ya that's why
but I think uh over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure ah
hmm maybe we can search everything
um
inside the
google
you can search what more activity that we can do over there
mmhmm mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I don't like to roller blade lah actually right I want to go snow city you know
but everybody say don't want to see seh don't want to go snow city say boring boring boring the I say okay lah nevermind lah
you want to go the I went to go ice cream but nobody want to go with me
alah huh
nobody want to go with me then I see just forget it lah
like that lor
maybe if can why not we go right
but actually snow city correct lah it's boring lah because you need to play the slide slide only
because that time when I school time I got go right
ya very very cold
mmhmm ya you need to wear very thick clothes
ya they give you glove
of course
because that time I go with school right it's a school activity so everything have been paid
before we even go for the event
ya
yes correct it's very dirty
ya
correct
wah we die
mmhmm
ya
but zoo is so boring
that time remember go on our birthday april is like so boring
you can't even play with the animal
ya I want to play with the monkey
then I want to touch the lion
but I didn't get to touch the lion this time
last time when I small at least I got to touch you know
lion
that's why
so it's a hot day man nowadays also it's a hot day
if like I aiyo if I go there eh
right that's why
so I think we should
plan properly ah if we really want to go for activity
ya
obvious ah they going to bring their children because nobody going to take care since
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
ya lah I think um
will love it okay will love it
the one that is suggest just now
it's a nice view lah
ya
not bad right
we really don't have enough time for each other also
but got zipline or not
oh ya kallang right
rock climbing right oh ya ya ya
ya that's why but if I not wrong need to pay you know
I know
if I not wrong have
maybe we can buy some snack ah
but you know like this kind of
always have uh family gathering kan
mm
they
ya but you need to book also you know
a'ah
you never know sometime
people want to walk inside alamak inside your tent
oh ya we should have a receipt eh mm
after we already book we should have a receipt ah
hmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
a'ah

ya
mmhmm

ya
ya okay lah

mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm if like
hmm

mmhmm

mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
so at least we can save lah save a bit
like over there mm

but I think this is already nice planning ah
that's why
but make sure lah this time round happen lah eh

obedient eh

hello
okay can alright mm
so how are you
ya lah you what have you been doing
mm
mmhmm
so
so
really
oh I don't like to work from home especially
about one month
I rather work at from the office
so between you and me the the the experience is different lah
ya
how long how long
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
then my drink then how how how is that
effective ya
mm it's not at all also
oh my god and the
and he he is used to that
mm
and your room
oh okay
or
orh
mm okay so the experience is quite
okay lah for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
back to school already right
oh
oh one more month wow
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
wow you got
two months of holiday ah not bad ah you
mm
uh huh
like what
why
spent too much on what
oh how much you earn ah that that that job
mm
hundred per
oh
ninety nine
per night
wow
okay
makeup stuff
orh
Tampines
huh then how you travel seh
Yishun correct orh so you got straight bus there lah
technically lah a bit lah
compared to staying at ah compared to where you are now until
mm okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience what you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
uh
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two K lah
mm
wow not bad ah you
do you know you know in cause I did packing job also but the best
uh the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the in the emtire human line
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up what
ah kan so if you are the first person it's the easiest job ah but quality check a bit hard ah
I did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
err we start at about nine kan then we need to
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so I usually need to scoop the ah the rice is either you
then total the whole day must I don't know what's the target lah but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person ah so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
the industrial area at Woodlands there lah
mm so they needed manpower uh so they asked manpower from my company so so ya lor
mm
yup my current company lah so this this this the the the the workplace that I work for
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them lah mm
mm
ya lor so that's why I when I ask you how how was your experience for the packing I understand lah what it means when you say fast paced
oh
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience I mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can lah
no ah you will learn one usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
and the pay is quite good lah
three K lah three K for I don't know how many weeks of working lah so ya
oh
oh
so you what you
oh okay okay can
mmhmm
mm
okay
oh
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest packing job is it
compared to your your your makeup makeup one
you just sign up only
mm then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
oh
oh but night shift though
mm
technically ah what time start
eight thirty must be there
then finish at eight
so eight to eight err eight to eight ah
oh
okay lor can lah then you better survive in this job
packing
is it
mm I understand
how's you and Andy
ya that is tea don't you realise it
mm ee I ask you first how's you and Andy
you and Andy on InstaStory
oh okay okay okay okay
oh
that's why you guys spend time together
mm
Andy Andy Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
oh I mean
oh
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
understand each other
good lah good lah
mm
not talk
mm
well good lah good lah at least
in in this relationship the two of you
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
ya how long already ah
what
three years
not bad ah three years ah this is this the longest
mm
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay okay I think I remember I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay lah actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya lah because his side he don't make it he don't
uh his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya mm
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like hais eh cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
err me and him are dealing shitty stuff now lah so ya
do you know what he's working now
mm you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram ah
oh
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya so he's an insurance agent
so under but uh under there's a sister company called
so err basically how to plan your how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
mm so okay lah
ah so so he invest I mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people kan
ya so you will meet new people of many of different ages uh different character
okay lah I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so um
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
fourth year in the relationship
okay so okay ah now I explain to you what happen
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me ah oh um
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like uh means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
get it so means ah means ah like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about Lina that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his
ah so that is the first time it happened
ah it
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
not interested lah because that girl also have a boyfriend
no is err volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for
ah
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional uh breakdown ah I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp lah like
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating lah but but but but
I don't I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct a'ah
so during is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
kan uh
ya
this is what I'm trying to say lah don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
like limited talking to new people
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is um
err way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say ah this is me ah this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit lah
so ya hais
no I don't know because
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to to end up uh like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me ah if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya lah
like that's why when you things like uh on Twitter will say this and that right you you wait sometimes you need to leave you you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
ah I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know lah
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
that's why I was I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
not exactly lah
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
yes sure up to you you can go ahead and share
mm
mm
but you you do try to recover after that right
mmhmm
mm ah that's the word make up
mm
ya lah
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
kan
mm
mm
mm mm
with him
mm at least at least a goal with him kan
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
we like I say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like err am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
ya so now I'm just like
uh like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I
met his parents
his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
haiya ya lah the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
my my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
mm eh
like
kan kan so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him with him right
mm
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
so far so far during this period right
where uh like
mm
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story lah okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware sia
err like I don't know a week ago maybe
he's
I know I understand
hais
hais
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I I hint only lah I hint to my mother only lah
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to uh
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya loh
on my Instagram I think people can like oh okay Hans and Lina is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
mm
too
I have fallen for him too hard that uh now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person lah but
that's my that's that's what I'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
ah it's just me expressing my emotions
mm and and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
huh
ya it affect
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
I'll just knockout ah so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing lah
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
then
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so um
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already lah so that is good enough
hmm ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand lah
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
ya ya ya ya
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
busy seh
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space seh that is good that's what I need eh
we just need a different type of um router ya
ya
kan that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
mm
ya means we need an additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the
how many wifi you have at home
oh you have two
one is at
mm so you are connected to your
parents' one
mm
ya
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
mm
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work your normal work
then we got Zoom meeting Zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we we we are all
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay I tell you now ah
err
I and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one err some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
mm
ah
uh
mmhmm
no just now one is because I had to do a a mini training for this ah tomorrow's training
ya
ya so ya lor
then anyways so I am starting another job again cause I was just
I was like quite happy that I I'm out of the community club
then on Tuesday I am back I'm going to
ah ya is to I'm going to do some homeless job you know as in err
pay to maintain the the the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just it's just COVID things ah it's it's it's it sucks bro hopefully hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal
ya
uh
mm
five hundred right
ya that's the rate for poly
huh
your is
five hundred
unless you work at retail retail will be eight hundred
ya so that's why I never like you get to experience internship right then
at least you experience the paydrop when you say it's five hundred for the poly we will say it's normal ya it's it's just the rate
as an intern
it's okay lah you already pass through the err internship phase unless you want to go degree then maybe another internship
being what broke oh you want to work for your own
up to you your decision you still got like half a year to go
September
ya you're graduating April right
ya
or you can take a year break and work then go and study or you can study part time and work up to you
it's your choice
mm
but what degree you want to take same similar or
similar as your the things you are doing now or
or you want to try something new
business ah
mm explore your options ya
ya eh not bad seh you went through like different certificates seh
kan kan then then when you have a kid right you when you have a kid right then you can say which one you want to know
I went through all ya
you went through N O uh and higher NITEC then diploma if you take
degree you go degree ah if you go further ah all also you have
oh it runs in the family
uh uh
ya like that ah depends ah what you want
me

mmhmm
oh
oh
queue again lah from the back
mm then
oi
mm
the area lah
mmhmm
ya ya you did you did
mm
yes
mm
hmm
mm I was contemplating on what
manifest
temek
oi
twenty eighteen
mmhmm you still cannot say his name
yes his prints are like a cow
on the world map but black and white
you were you
yes
ya
mm
mm
sec
five
seventeen
mm
ya
ya
but
ya
ya
yes
what
yes
very small
hmm this is small already
mmhmm
mm
mm
ya
mm
is this
there's less demand hence there's
no
well less demand equates to higher price lah because there's
no more saturation of market
for there to be a
mm
ya
I think I think lah they will start to downgrade the price but it's not
decrease they will decrease the price but it won't be soon
mm
ya
mm no choice lah
mm
yes
mmhmm
mm
well ya I didn't miss the outside though
no no no the house
I like your room but I didn't like the outside
oh that okay
ya
um
yes
mmhmm
yes
mm they are very very nice yes I agree
the room is nonsense ya
ya your female friend that one
something like curry or stew or something
mm
mm
mm
you will considered it
for yourself
then there will be two rooms and so you rent out the whole thing
mm
mmhmm
mm yes

oh so this one is um actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding kan
tru
um but again I thin
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
oh ya lah that one I think normal lah since my time many years ago also same also lah the thing ya so I think uh ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for lor at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least lah
oh because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
mm I think I think in this case ah I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
more fundamental lah but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya gemod lah gemod is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know uh his side ah
hundred fifty ya seh hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise lah it's lik
like okay in that case we do separate lah that is another alternative ah other alternative then your side then ah then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech oh wah like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
uh bottom line you both must tel
err got two choice if want to combine the
then err you and hairin you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
extra guest whereas for his uh no need then you leh you just you just invite lah whoever that is important between your lis
err then is like you al
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say ah
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
then after that I think um at that tim
we buy some things on our sid
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all lah ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually um pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push ah you no need to type ah you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes ah food ah food dishe
you will you will see like ah how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
uh tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of eh um
uh what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place lah then after that uh if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
uh then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
ah so then from there oh then you all like oh okay lah then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
ah so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline lah so that even though you got five months uh to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say khatib uh when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like uh the cabinet or whatever because I believe uh you got to check that one lah renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask err K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this lah there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that ah so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it lah that is one part of it ya so ya lah so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care kan
my only thing is that okay if he's uh you all have to like let's say workout lah the thing lah workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it uh on i
oh I think uh
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan lah
but then you have to stay in one place for two years lah or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking err is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay kan then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that ah
uh take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming lah so there's one one idea you can hav
you can have the big wedding but err we have to burden one of the side lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat lah kan
okay so err if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then uh so you spend lavishly ah your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion uh of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
oh ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide lah
ah what they want lah ah because I thin
err mix up what is it like like you think that oh what I want to have oh I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it lah
in other in one I read about in err on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing lah
I don't okay y
both side actually exchange gift ah how many you want to have it depend
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow lah no need lah I pay now loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
okay what righ
ah but I think in today's context can be just lik
if not screen shot and then you se
if let's say you know the oh your partner ah really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either um
like I said lah is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
uh get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like err like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
ya lah she wants the opinio
ah there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like err the person uh then where the family said firmly talk oh it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that uh kind of situations o
err kills the that particular portion lah but in this younger generation in your generation err things have changed progressivel
they cannot even get flat eh they must buy a condo or private propert
ah high ceiling income but then err there's one period of time he changed jo
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know ah and then they finally got it ah then but there's a word then the reaso
err a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple lah ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no lah to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already ah
like very stress then me leh then ho
uh you know the more th
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception um but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
you know and ah both ways lah both parties lah so uh people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects lah
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
ah then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then um you can't convince your parents lik

have you watched the the the the what the marriage
ah the world of the marriage it's on Netflix now
so you watched the first episode
okay um for my this is my opinion lah kan
the first few episodes was good
the the wife is psycho kan
yes because
did did they did she even fall in love
oh
the the psychiatrist the psychiatric or psychiatrist guy doctor the guy
ya they he like secretly meet up behind the
the the the lead actress the wife the first wife behind her back
ya
the show kan
like merepek apa
sixteen I think
ya
I think because kan the first five episodes the first few episodes kan that they had such a good response
and then they kind of felt pressured to do better so people
oh ya they follow the standards eh
I know but then why the lock
ya I locked I locked already
the writer failed big time
ya I know we watched it like so many times
ya
nineteen eighty eight is the best one
that one park bo gum

for what
mmhmm
ah give you referral to national skincare
it's like
what is comedonal I only know komodo dragon
oh then you go
the problem still persists
after that right now her skin super flawless

eh they said this primer not good tau
then you don't use it
I learn makeup from TikToks and it helps a lot
only use on your sweaty area which I think your cheeks don't need any
mm
I think that now my makeup stays stays longer now
cause I only use powder I only use foundation over here
over here and over here
here
then after that I use the loose powder
uh the brown brown colour what is it called
contouring
then after that use powder

did you all lose weight if through using the that Odella
a lot ah how many
how many kilo you lost
wah in one month
but
what you wanted wasn't weight loss then what you wanted
really now did you get your already
is that
oh
then you thought you dropped out

okay
mm
what type of superpower I want ah
because err even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
um
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
um ya it's not a
err
err to fight crime
like
err and they don't just fight
err those on earth
people from
the aliens
both of them ya
how about you
uh
uh
mm
mm
bat batman or iron man
uh
mm
specific
ability is to fly
mm
mm
powers
doctor strange mm
uh
oh
mm
orh
mm
mm
ah
ya hogwart that one ah
ah
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
mm
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation ah
teleportation boring ah
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train kan you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
mm
mm
okay
mm
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
mm
um
mmhmm
mm but people need what
okay when you are rich you might not feel that oh money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million lah not not like that lah
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
no you should
mm
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
err
let them err
it might be a it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
mm
it's a
power
ah
ah where you can give to people
uh huh
okay because most of the villains in and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
mm
but how
I think that one is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
mm
mm
mm
mm
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that err no need to work lah
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that eh why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
ya
mm
mm
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe err
err
err superman is boring lah or maybe the flash
or
mm
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
uh
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
uh superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
mm mm
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
mmhmm
ah
okay next
no no that one they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one lah who will fight
wonder woman
err something like that lah the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
err letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once mah
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
stream
apple uh
ya right
ya
apple apple lah the I
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
uh
they'll new movies will go into
that one produce by Netflix that's why they do that
free
ah
so
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
ah that's how they get their for themselves monthly subscription
uh this is how they fund their movies
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
that's how they make money lah it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
subscribe and err upgrade their
account
from one person only
mm
let's say
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
they can they are they are free to pay any amount mah to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
you fast forward eh you
mm
mm
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
mm
mm
uh
orh
orh
okay
mm
superpower
mm
very burdensome power
what is the most burdensome about every power
about every superhero sorry
what what's the burden
with
great power comes great responsibility
ah ya lah what's the burdensome about every single superheroes' superpower
mm
mm
ah
what about
what about the batman that doesn't kill people
mm
so what the batman need to do from
actually
burdensome

thor has a lot of flaws
thor has a lot of flaws
he can't be the king of his own
people
ah ya lah
that that is flaw lah
and then he's
he is not a god he is more human
he's not a god of thunder he's a more he's he's more human
that the story is just telling people that he's not a god he's a human
no he's not a god because he has flaws
he can he he can die also
that what the story is trying to say is even a god like him will so god has flaws

the same at every house
some people have surround sound but some people just have normal

proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go

very pushy ah so like
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than

so like
ah I forgot the word lowball ah something like lowball ah
no no value ah kan

but ya that's why
so that time middle of october kan so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months ah kan so actually
I think one or two weeks before ah two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right ah so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest ah maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same ah one week difference I think
the normal tech
huh
ya
because like the hall
it's like a big group ah then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better lah until october
data entry lah you know those
just typing on excel kan basic ah
ah office ah and typing or sending email those basic admin work ah
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description kan is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said um they said okay monday to friday the timing is um I think
about five to ten ah or four to ten like five hours ah or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
um for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply um sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear ah
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer ah so
like but mostly mostly also must support ah because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support kan
so phone support is a bit too much ah you know
ah that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable kan it's a it's it's python programming considered high level kan
uh they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
mm
it's called ah fortran
A N ya
is it C hash or something hash
ah C sharp
huh golac
G G O L A C eh
oh golang
mm
okay then
because
building kan
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these ah data and then maybe
a bit of support ah the support kind of role ah
because like for me last time I work in a bank kan
twenty nineteen ah twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
kan
that time I work in a bank kan so
so um laymans kan the back end ah so
you know logs kan you know logs
L O G S ah log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
go to back end and then take everything out lah
then investigate maybe or something
um the front part is a investigation ah
but the it's like ticket ah like they say what
support and ticket and then
uh raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close ah
then last what you call that analyse ah whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite um interesting or it's it's quite a
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called uh run the bank ah not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means um
it means that the the app is ongoing ah you understand like it's not a project ah that means the project already finish that means it's live ah live product being used by users ah
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china uh all this so the timezone all weird weird one
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us what
ya then their working hours until our six what so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues what I think there's only one period that
low low what low traffic eh
ah nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven ah because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead what only lah then just wake up what that time
because there's two countries new york eh no two states
new york and where ah san francisco right ah
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server ah
I don't think so ah or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank ah our local bank so ya the business not so much ah
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this ah this basic functions ah kan
oh they call it the green eh green lane eh
but but
we cannot go right
ya but somebody must handle that what
they can come
ah they they can say ah ya they can use the fact that their house right at clementi need to do something ah right collect the mail the mailbox ah because
um
but the the tenant kan you know the eh now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail ah
who
okay
cousins uh
they I think busy also ah
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight ah
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
huh
mm
so there's money
it's not in the fridge eh
oh
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
fry the eh fry the fish first right
I think the it ah the the the preparation is a
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife ah hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid ah
but it's it's good if you have a maid ah but
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house kan so one maid right um share our woodlands house
they maybe my future house or your future house ah so then like the maid right
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else ah like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first ah
hmm
ya
no but I think
internally kan if
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off ah right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal ah because um as long the maid
huh
normally the maid off sunday kan one day off kan
ya
but I think they're a bit
eh
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map kan is fixed ah
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual ah
ya then if the stock finish
oh wah cool ah
so call move ah
I think no but
I think I think ah Singapore difficult because you know why or not
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental ah
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface ah the mapping kan the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue ah kan
but they they can they will monitor your work ah
oh ya ah standard meeting ah kan
oh last time that time zoom you all also use zoom ah
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people kan during the COVID
really ah
huh they going to open here ah
ya but singapore smart ah I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues ah
oh good ah ah are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not ah now
ya
oh open already ah I don't know ah
half ah
I think half of that
eh I think because I think
susah nak apa kita
ah predict the people kan because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
oh actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those um
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what ah counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot ah like last time I went I went exchange also same ah I I
because most people will eat solo ah because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so
the counter table is like just one person ah then you face the you face nobody ah like you know face like a the wall or something ah so it's like against the wall kan
ah actually they should make like that
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
serangoon garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor lah you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting ah like like al-ameen at our place the the woodgrove kan
ya open concept ah like is is like sheltered lah
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person ah then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side tau that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
so that means like the four of you ah or three of you kan will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing ah but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then ah section off like one table instead of six right become four lah you know
I mean they can do that lah but I think
maybe today they change lah because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
or if they more than five
so I think recently there's a news ah then they like to inter change like I think they
but I think
but must pity the the business owner ah for because actually right like very strict ah I mean eh it's it's not the kan
uh eh it's so they are very strict ah
so
I think some of the
kan complain ah like oh call police ah I don't know what they call ah they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually oh at first maybe they ask them to go out lah say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
another search ah you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy kan
ya I think maybe like they have a counter lah like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't ah what you call that scan out ah checkout from the place
huh
ah trace together kan
oh that one
oh because of bluetooth ah
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
oh
so like between ah android and they also know what to do right
ya
um
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google ah kan
I don't know ah because like maybe I want to try Google ah but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air kan
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini eh
you can play um I mean you can play the eh what's it called ah the radio station like singapore radio station
ah live streaming ah as long you got wifi lah
so actually from the wifi eh but actually dangerous oh I realise kan they recognise our voice oh
the google home speaker ah I mean the I mean google home ah
because right that time kan my friend kan
so
I ask google ah using my voice ah like when is my birthday or what is my age ah something
then they know ah cause I think like google gmail ah all this something
so like they know uh something like my birthday or my name ah
then because my friend got google phone right
oh there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker ah the google home speaker kan then he ask um like what is my name or something ah
then the google know that it's him then say his name
ah or birthday ah ah I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess what
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person what
ah so a bit scary lah I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community kan instagram or something kan
but if the wifi off kan but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device kan
so will it still listen
um connect you
to the
but default ah but if you ask like questions like um
ah offline what do you call it offline data ah
what basic basic functions ah kan
ya
it's good ah
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon what a lot so
I think because they also got money ah so their apartment like one room one bedroom ah so like those studio ah
got how many version ah I also don't know ah
smart home device ah
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven kan like is there a brand for smart oven now
oh
oh
got smart shower or not I don't know
oh but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there lah because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen ah I don't know
or voice ah
eh but that means right COVID better what if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene kan then I think maybe future ah singapore the lift also maybe smart kan
or lift system
I think can make right
oh the base I mean there's a pedal kan
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working ah so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens kan too many screen one is left one is right kan
because you card is only one level ah

your resume
ya ya
ah ah ah ah

I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to um another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
mm
click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you ah they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
ah so
yes ya
then you can you can use their err
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you lah I'm not sure about your personal one but my school one has like
um my school's background
err you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show lah
mm
K
mm
so when you click share screen right
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
it will show everything that I go
everybody can see that
but
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share lah share
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
ah you stop share lah
ya so you just stop share
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
mm
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say um they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that one is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
allow
she chose don't allow
pick the stop video I mean I mean ah like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
mm
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
thumbs up thumbs down
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands uh put down your hands yes no
err thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs ah hands up
ya usually at the participants area lah
ya then like just now you can like
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want siti instead
so siti ya and then other basic things is err okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
okay so you can choose between like err record on your laptop or record on cloud
and then I had to record the classes
ah I chose
the first mistake was I chose uh to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
mm so so I had to I had to
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
mm ya
and then some basic things like chat
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host uh even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which err will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
uh instead of everyone there's like person ah other people's name all the participants' name lah then they will have like bracket privately
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
it will be altogether
mm ya but that's just like
mm other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
forty people
so I will just
I'll just be like err there will just be a notification that pops out uh proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait lah
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
mm
mm I guess so lah but like
cause
I get
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just err
it will just be somewhere here lah
like ya
google meet or live outlook something like that lah
mm
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal then you just copy and send to people lah
mm
but just now you had you had something on
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
mm but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries lah
ah
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
ah
oh
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
huh
the gavin err
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation what
oh then the escape room is they create or what
welfare pack kan everything is online now what so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff ah
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with lah so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like err cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical one or something like that but like
maybe maybe ya then they
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather um if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay what to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that lah
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried lah we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that lah like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
mm
and then like initially I wanted to
uh produce like three different
to produce one instead
engage in home-based businesses
like it was supposed to be
release
oh it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of uh
they open lah but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
err we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
woohoo
ya our target was four hundred dollars
four courses a'ah
err each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my um
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half lah like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible what it's not to rely on like
kan so like that's what he said lah he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
mm but ya not not there yet not as
mmhmm mm
ya then we're like that's quite true lah
um no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is oh third is excel and forth is um
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like err in our faculty there was there's another group
oh by the way I won a giveaway from them
ya it's a just a makeup set lah ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
oh ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
ya
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course lah ya
and then fast forward err
like
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him lah I was like oh will you be interested oh I ask his number from my friend and then after that ah I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
ah but ya it's just it's
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
uh two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like uh extra class notes and he even like answered err post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
oh but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like
and like
ya and he
oh he was err he was chosen for and Facebook or something like that like I know like uh ya
prestigious one lah but then
but he in the end he chose like I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
mm really meh
mm okay lah ya I guess
but he's really smart I'm just like wow
how is someone that smart
ya
soft launch soft
soft launch for what
oh the Staple B is it
bento set
oh
mm
but like what does his dish contain
fragrant white
right
but it's like is it meant to be healthy or like
oh
what else is inside his dish like it's just chicken and rice it's a bit like plain no
but I saw the pictures it was quite nice
ya
it's at novena
so is that good
oh
how is going to earn from that
ah
so food court lah
that's basically a food court
mm
that's a food court
there's like a bar right
ya like it's a
a hawker semi bar kind of place ya
mm no but I just do my assignments like I'm swamp with assignments now
ah it's focus more if your if your room is conducive lah but
no but like
I don't know like I felt I felt like you get burnout quite easily if you
stay at home a lot and cause for me I don't even go out at all what I never go out to study I didn't even go out like back to school to like cause all my friends
no but like over there I guess it's conducive quite a little bit conducive I don't know I don't know but
but like
so many places
where you tell me where
like I don't even know how people study in tampines hub
the basement kan you're talking about the basement right
ya the is twenty four hours what
ya I mean how can people go inside without going inside the area
ya
oh no cause COVID then now they
oh but library now they open
I think
bugis the national library and like some bigger national libraries like tampines library they open like
for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online lah
like I don't mind studying outside but
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is oh my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that one my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams err assignments to do
six
all different lah so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
twenty four hours ah
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can lah but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you lah but
like it's not not
neh
no but it was
it was so much time lah I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
huh
no lah
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
oh you look at
exactly ya
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
oh no but
but one thing bad about online school was that err
orh okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module lah but
ah generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
no the answer is no
oh that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
like err
about the same so let's say
in this uh my first mod then my second mod right I have like um my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
um let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like eh it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like yay no exam fun what then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like huh why I never knew until I experience it
and my major err
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words lah
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major one
and then two thirteen november okay then this one is okay lah relax lah
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two lah but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam what like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time lah then now I think
some period
now and
two eh no week six that's the crazy period lah cause that's the like now now is my chiong period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster lah
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
that's that
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
err result for my which one
my four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
mm
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you lah
ya
huh
oh no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments kan
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case lah cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that what then I think they don't want lah
ya but
I guess it's it's okay lah
like
mm will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did lah
ya
ya
it's like
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni lah I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my
cause when you freeze your then cause of my now is is okay lah I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
ya and then after that
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
mm
mm
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like oh
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
uh our sem two kan sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email lah they said like oh like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no cause they were I think
so they said cannot lah like
I think only countries to europe
asia and
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there lah
ya
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything lah
but the thing is my
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again lah cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
you have to wait
you have to wait another year lah so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do um online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause uh you're it's actually taking
right
no it's not
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if uh
they don't let
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck lah we just we just trying to ask but
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then um the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
and obviously the school will not allow it lah
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore what if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can lah which is damn unfair cause it's just like
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
eh
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous lah
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first ah so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options ah to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay lah no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now what it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
oh ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision what remember
like for me to enter my my
but ya oh did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know lah
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report lah
ya but no the thing is
mm like cause some people notice like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
then like people like
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything lah
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know ah just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
uh what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release err a statement lah saying like oh increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know lah look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
um my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like oh like it only happens in everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous lah
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report lah like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic ah
like everytime another one comes and then like uh yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that what

okay clap
hello hi madir

err I'm studying I'm working I'm uh I'm now in college central I'm taking floristry course and um I'm working as a deliveroo and grabfood
uh brand
it's not that I like ah I love mango so um
that's all I can think of ah
err shape of the mango eh um I think it's um
um
um
I think that mango is just rare lah in singapore too if they sell
oh why is it my favorite food um
um
um
the type the types of mango that ah my
the types of mango my ah my brother
I like I don't know how to describe but just mango is just my favorite lah
mango kan and it's a fruit
perfect
and also it's also and it's also healthy
like my brother said um
ya it ya it's sunshine
shine your day you know like brightens your day up you know when you eat mango
so um
you know
oh um
so um other than that um I
other than that
err
like
I don't know eh like um
mango is just
mango is just everything ah to me like
um
you can just
you know like make juice you can make a cake you can make a puff
you can make everything with mango because mango is just
amazing
pudding right
they
ya they they process like syrup for us to you know to
to drink as a
just for an everyday drink you know
because mango just
you can do whatever you want with mango
like literally anything you want with mango because
mango is just like you know
we can't talk much about mango because
like what my brother said everyday everyday we eat mango
we
we like
rarely talk about it you know
uh this topic came out from my brother
don't know how to talk about mango because mango is just so many things um so many things to talk about so
like
you know it's all stuck inside our heads like we cannot think of it but then
you know it's just mango
of course not
but we can make it you know
make a new recipe
because
like we said mm huh mango we can do anything with it mm huh we can just do anything with mango
so you can just put like what Sprite
smash up the mango and then make it a mango soda you know
of course not
one of it is you know sometimes when you leave your mango outside for too long
um
you know when you leave your mango outside for too long and and then you never eat it like for a long time and then
when you will have the appetite to eat it er
after that while
then when you start to you know peel off the mango and then you see this um rotten part of the mango
then you taste the rotten part of mango and then
your appetite is just lost
but other than that um
uh this is why we have to um always keep our mangoes fresh
and keeps our mango um
um keep our mangoes fresh and then keep like um you know inside the fridge what to let it cool so that it won't rotten that fast
and um
other than that uh
uh ya it's ah after you like what he said like um
and then you blend it
it will definitely taste like ice cream like
it's like a mango yogurt ice cream you know something like that you know like
um
like a smashed mango but then it's frozen
it's cold it's like not it's like it's like not the normal eh err mango is just like
you know like
ice cream tasty like
mango you know
and um
for me personally I like mangoes that are cold
because I
don't like um
because I
like summer days ah you know when you eat this
oh my god
I totally forgot about it also
yeah and
oh my god how can we forget about that
when you eat during that hot weather and it melts in your mouth
you can taste the mango inside you can taste the freshness inside
when you uh after you exercise or after you
I tell you all it's really really really really nice
ah
um as per normal my day has been going great
err obviously
and ya today I've ah today I started school a bit later because um as per as per usual I always wake up late
but I will still attend to school and then um after school I will I will always work

I think they send by parents gateway I got message but I haven't checked on parents gateway lah
ya
and it's
is it how come I don't know
ya
they don't know what that day I asked
I ask the
teacher
said not sure they also
I haven't decided whether to
to stay stick with the same class or
change
ya I think but less movement now lah
less moving around in school
shouldn't be lah it should be easier for the teachers
during this period

ya
but then I feel like december kan school holiday
mm ugh
mmhmm
Pan Pacific service suite
um beach road
because you all going as a family so I thought like you'll be
better
it'll be better to have
an apartment instead of
a normal hotel room
mmhmm
then
then before that
then before that like before check in or after check in do you plan to do anything
in pacific
how many
because of the number of adults that you book kan
that's why they follow like
ya
eh eh sorry sorry
mmhmm
I think it's easy seh if you get like central
a'ah
because I thought like if you know if we have if we go for apartment instead of normal hotel then
oh
mm
is that the kitchen then
and then
uh
ya
like that's what I thought
because since
he's awkward either way
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya correct
oh
I think you should go I think with kids is fun
and because that time then that time she draw a butterfly and then the butterfly that she draw just fly around
ya I think since you got like a child maybe that is maybe that's fun
if not I can find for you also lor
that around december but I'm not sure when exactly but I'm guessing it's december it'll be credited to your SingPass
then like make use of that lor
or maybe if you not using that as a
I mean for your hotel then I think you can use for your activities
ya
hundred dollars
ya my
uh huh
sea aquarium
adventure cove
ya
then can also
then they have that lazy river
but then do you think angah will
this hotel also nice
have you gone before
I think you went before
oh is it
ya
because it's too malay
I mean like since
since angah like
I forgot it was a while back
like few years it's like a while back
a while back
mm can ah
at Noosh Noodle Bar
eh we have the same thing
we can quiet for too long
mm okay
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
you went so far and you ate you went to japan
to eat a
crazy ah
I also don't really like japanese curry
ya
maybe they like it because
that's their idea of curry like our idea of curry is different
ya so when I tasted aside he set up
in singapore dollars
ah okay
mmhmm
but then I feel like if you go eat overseas I think you don't even
feel like you're spending too much of money on like food
it's like I think I don't think you will mind
did you had the
Luke's Lobster
why didn't you eat it's so good
thing it's overflowing it's marvellous
so actually if you convert it's like twenty
ya
so it's actually pretty similar but because you
if you like craving for it just go for it lah twenty plus dollars
because I think they have like fixed
um measurement on how many how much lobster to put on the bun
then that time also I had this yakiniku you know yakiniku
the beef
Yoshinoya
oh no okay yakiniku is the
okay lah like that is after they yakiniku the beef mah
but yakiniku is basically you get
to grill the the beef
maybe because they yakiniku it in the kitchen you you don't get to do it
but ya
that
that time there was only one halal yakiniku outlet
the asakusa temple area
ya
it's so nice one of the set was wagyu then I'm like
it's so soft oh my god
I don't know when we get to go to japan again I'm so sad
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
I think
I mean it is technically lah but
okay dish
dish I think I would pick
like
let's see is soup like a dish
ya ya ya it is it is a dish
so that means like mee soto is that a dish
do you consider that a dish okay then I will pick
no I won't choose mee soto okay I think I will pick
um
a'ah there's like so many things that I like
hmm
I don't know
let me see let me think
he if given a choice
I would probably choose a seafood dish though
chicken
garlic
so good
want to eat ya true alright
okay
ya that's a dish
if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day which actor would you
want to become and why
you will eh she eh she got so many business
okay let's change it to celebrity
ya lah so celebrity who's
ya you have your own beauty line
some more you recently if you're rihanna you recently released the
the lingerie line
experience
a'ah
a'ah seh
maybe she got servants
she imaging the sleepover party
oh my god
a'ah
like got
don't know
ya
ya then after that I think he used
he used
and then they put there as a meme
oho like the circuit breaker
a'ah
ya
was like I'm
you all have to stay home today but the celebrities
oh my god
a'ah
that's why
a'ah
and then they have
a'ah movie room ya
I think probably we have the right to complain
aiya I think it'll be fun
can you imagine
like I cannot imagine myself
staying in that kind of house but okay
I would like to try
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
buy one get one free you get one
like the worst
thing to have buy one get one free
ever
I think it's
a bad thing ya
a'ah
mmhmm mm mm
ah
ya so that's one of the bad ones
lower on is free
but I actually find that ya I find that a fair deal
then ah if they like talking about things then I feel like I cannot think of any as of now
um
good looks
ya I feel like I choose good looks also
like the that like uh
a'ah
because like how do I say like good fit body you can train to get it
face
face is
at your head so I don't think like you know you can have like
err you still not a
uh huh
I like crime documentaries
a'ah a'ah
court cases
mmhmm correct
fight for their clients you no no no like he or she is not wrong
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya
right
popular
they still show but I'm not sure whether it's new seasons
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya I think hawk gate horror right I think it's
if the plot case is good
and then I think that um
a'ah
I don't
I don't think
I think paranormal activity is
uh like you know I don't ya
it really happened
a'ah the original camera
so I feel like a bit like okay
tactic
something new
but then recently I've been watching the bailey
bailey's makeup videos
the makeup mystery and murder makeup murder and mystery
but then I feel like she always
bailey she just knows how to like
make sure everybody is not
the longer ones right
there's this one one movie that she told
that there's huh
that she covered
uh huh a'ah ah
I haven't really watch
uh
mm kids
oh the movie is just recently
oh okay okay okay okay okay
oh okay
crime documentaries but then there's so many to watch
mmhmm
stress
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
and she effectively you know
expecting
mm
okay I will watch soon I think tomorrow
I would wish for
what I would wish for
I think first things first I wish for no poverty in the world
and then
is there something that you always wanted to
something that you wanted for like so long
this can happen you wish
mmhmm
or is it
okay like when you
ah okay okay
a'ah a'ah
true
castle
like
a'ah
like your own land
with a swimming pool and then you can have a tennis court badminton court
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think everybody
I think primary school
but then it
oh
mmhmm
SARS is just singapore
I don't expect
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
father daughter or like kids
mmhmm
what is it oh your your
father is infected with COVID so
I think uh
it's the same I think for now
one of the wish is always to have
a mask-free
I'm waiting for the day that we can go mask-free
like finally
I think like oh
I think like
like he
I'm like one step closer to going to finally going I guess
be hygienic
you're not contributing you know then not even safe
okay
a duh
oh ya ya ya
sembawang
who
he's like so young
ya
ya
ya very funny right
ya I feel like it's so weird
interning gag
grants and all that
I don't think that's a long long term thing
ya I guess
a'ah
a'ah
that's why because I'm
I'm not even an intern but then they
because I think it's like
because
that's why they don't let us do that kind of things
ya then we just answer we just answer like enquiries lor
like let's say okay mainly is about passion card lah
I think they like
people
from other working at other places eh like customer service wise right if they
okay for example SingPost
the other time they refer a resident to the
grant
for the self employee
self-employed people
so basically not all grants is under lah then after that they
I think people who don't
visit their community centre often they don't know that
not everything is
ya
so when they
oh um we actually this this grant is not under us so
ya but then they are the one who refer us here why you cannot help us so I was like
okay they referred you here without knowing that the cannot do all these
because it's also what
like
to apply for these grants you have to login your SingPass SingPass
if can
ya our own public computer to
login to your SingPass because it's mah
I mean like okay lah if you allowed there's there's
I feel like some people should be
understanding about this issue
the other day
the other day uh
the right
they referred this resident to
to the to change their address their
ya1
ya
it's so weird right like should know that they are the ones who do all this
ya
so they refer in
so when they refer it when we refer right and I was like ya we can change we can change your uh at the but then it will
it will take like a few days
but then if you want like immediate then you can go to the then I'm like huh
like it's actually weird this kind of things actually happen the other day got also got resident they come to the and they like
uh can you help me look for a house
ya they really they really come to the to
ask for everything they ask for literally everything
so like
imagine the amount of time spent to explain to them that
hmm)(hmm
not everything we can do at
so funny
and then some people they understand lah but then you know some people when they like
a'ah
that's why I say
ah
because now
now also everything is online
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
need to go down mmhmm
a'ah
ya it's like that so yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
that was the life every day literally
so the other time also
the other time also there was this one
there was this one resident
the um financial assistance for the mum and then just recently
as in the application that the application for the
is the one who is supposed to receive the financial assistance right
the she passed away so she asking like if can transfer under his name
then I said cannot lah because your situation and your mum situation is different you all not listed living in the same address
but
I'm related to her she's my mum why can't I have the money instead
ya
then like that ya it's a needs it's hard it's hard to please everybody
especially if it's like
racial
and then I couldn't help right for example with their their grants or whatever
and then they always said things like
ya and I'm like it's not that
ya exactly
so they gonna play they're gonna play the race card also
that's what I thought like okay I'm not gonna
remain in the for a bit any longer
because by right I use
mm ya
at the
ya
ya
ya so it's not exactly in the dormitory but in their office
so like if the
issues with the
employers
ah
because they um employees from different different company mah so that means let's say if the employer don't want to like
uh
then when I went to the interview they said to be mentally prepared
because it's super crowded I'm like oh
I like okay
but but then I'll be in the office what
just be mentally prepared lor
mm
no lah
mmhmm
they didn't decrease the pay for them
then your diploma when start
dah
that time you went for the medical interview ah
you went already
ya
ya the immunity is lower lah basically
oh okay
oh really
oh okay
oh it's at a landed property
oh okay okay I think I seen
it's a child care
oh okay then how many
children you have in there
so do people like teach
over there or no
do you have to teach them anything or no
oh okay
five
oh
okay okay okay
youngest
then
but then they have different age groups
oh okay okay
child care
mmhmm
uh
oh okay
oh okay
oh okay and then mixed race like japanese and ang moh like um japanese and get japanese korean and sweden that swedish within
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
uh
oh
a'ah
this one more to the that one ah
ah
is it because the cost is higher or
then how is your like working hours like
oh office hours
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
oh okay
uh
mm mm mm mm
three teacher oh ya
mmhmm
mm
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
oh okay
ya ya ya
okay
a'ah
mmhmm
mm
uh
so it's very different
mmhmm
I think that's good
oh
they have a one hour half an hour thing ah
they have a half an hour half day thing ah
oh okay
oh their maids will take them half day I mean like very interesting
anytime after one

mmhmm
a'ah

it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot ah too risky
okay
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
uh how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but uh
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
WhatsApp
you know like the english one the not contemporary ah english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
uh uh lah okay lah then I I have to agree with you lah we go we put the partition that means
eh ya lah correct lah when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like um
ah like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
chey private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt lah all that lah so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny ah
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like uh
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
mm
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
uh mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
uh or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
mm
eh but the other day I went through um this hard zone or something lah the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across uh this person
uh he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else lah then it's already two K
just the platform
mm
I put uh under
uh extra budget column
in the planning lah so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then ah the service balcony you know the
the doorway um between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills uh window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it what so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay ah
mm
actually not bad leh you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that uh different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
wah I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
uh came to real life you know really eh so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like uh extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this one is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
ah
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else oh ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
err like the window grill I don't know
so but then that one I haven't research uh
but uh ya
I think I think it's because ah it's already old lah that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not what it's supposed to be tight what like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the uh the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this one capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical uh wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya lah that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia lah because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
uh recipients
eh but eh but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back yay belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house ah you watch the host ah hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
eh but the new season uh the other day I was uh randomly uh looking for right
and then I saw uh one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
um the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was ah what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this one this time round is this company aiya I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually uh watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this ah if not actually uh three D innovation is good leh
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
uh what do you call that low income families eh
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them ah because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget lah maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what ah you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper lah okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back uh
oh we didn't even say anything but he himself say that uh we we call
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years eh the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the uh what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that one
uh wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman seh to install our this one the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only lah that one okay lah but even so uh remember the
the also not proper
hollow eh
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask what we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
uh and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to hafari right
then ah then after that mm
either that or he know that he never do correctly lah he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable what right because ya it's a expensive tile
mm
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope lah we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet uh already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
they give us a quote at least we know uh like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the uh is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
hopefully that one will reduce the cost ah cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist uh off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have ah that one already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
ah
ah package ya two standard
mm
mm
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
oh double
ah
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if uh whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same uh the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need uh
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own uh contractor for the vinyl right
ah when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
ah
ya it is the newest click function that one right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own one but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
ha
ah
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in uh kids room
oh
ya
eh mm
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company uh he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give what remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
mm
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that one cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know uh overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that one also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is uh I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean eh you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
hmm
vinyl
mm
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this one remember this one got two option we this one is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move one without lesser groove
ya
maybe that one cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser ah grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
mm
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop uh water sucking mop what
that one that one you won't go into the groove
ya lah it suck water the mop suck water right
ah
okay water absorbing mop
oh
oh that one
that one very expensive that one is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but ah make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous eh that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old uh oh now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M one but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
huh difficult have what
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home one you go and find no
only that brush sial no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
ah
okay so uh actually oh I forgot to tell you I uh I sign up through Renopedia
and then um through there there will be contacting me ah like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even uh ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection lah so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us lah through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia what right
so is all go back to our own research ah
actually they say um doesn't mean the very the company eh very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the uh company but I must also research uh and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
ah hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then uh also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then err
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go uh down and uh have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give lah
ya uh but I haven't show you then I I even I even uh wrote down their names the
uh
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
oh ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down what
mm
it must be a balance ah we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
ah to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house

of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her ah
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
that guy ah then that eventually
um
living off from her wealth
was actually very very very
um
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama ah
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage ah because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
uh you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this uh phrase
ya
but
uh they got divorce but then
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
um
she like restrained herself
in this kind of thing again ah drama again
ya
mm
but then I heard that
I mean lah I don't know cause Syamsul Yusof has always been
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love what like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella
but they got back together
but he has a long list of crime record here in Malaysia I mean in Singapore kan
because I heard that he stole something and everything
but
I don't know lah how to say about him but I feel that he keeps on screwing things over and over and over again
oh wells
ya
ya
but
I don't know lah
ah up to him lah he celebrity lah
ya the original price is about three hundred fifty seh and hundred fifty for three hundred fifty treatment
then right I see their steps like firstly they will like massage
then after that they will like put essential oil for you to relax then they will put something for your scalp then they wash
then after that they put like this
beads then they crush it then they put like the medicine the carotese medicine or what
then after that they steam
after they steam then uh
okay already like they blow dry
mm I like I mean I've booked for tomorrow but I don't know what time what time you going school ah
ah
oh means you like end end work at twelve ten like that is it
wah that's fast seh
uh like ya lah like I heard there's like nothing fun there
like nothing interesting to eat
there's no fastfood right
what
is it nice
huh is like
so
we wouldn't like appreciative about that
ah
ah
but if most of them okay then should be fine lah I mean
hais you know I I
I have like about
two more one year plus
till I end my work
I never know why
well cause maybe you don't really get sense of security there like everyday it's like it's playing with your anxiety did you do something wrong or not
ya
why I mean like even if I were to continue my studies I don't think I'll be in the same school as you
huh they you mean you don't chiong last minute one
ah
aiya maybe
which captain
oh
ya I I heard that they were going to continue there also but then they already there oh my god
but I thought yours is near the one
orh
then did they say hi
cause some of the stuff they are like over
overpriced or like they take from Shopee or something
ya tomorrow oh my god ya so right I don't know seh what I I should like spend on cause I budget myself to only spend like three hundred
so like one hundred fifty gone
then maybe like fifty gone for transport and like nine thirty gone for
and a fifty I mean like another hundred gone for eating
so that would be two hundred fifty then I mean I have like fifty dollars left
like what you cannot also buy seh fifty dollars
no I mean for the whole month
ya so confirm cannot save like that
I've been trying to save
that's true some more I pay for the bill and then pay for myself
hais
oh ya ya that's true
hais
oh
you like right what you doing
anyway I think oh my god ya then after that
I need to buy present for Anas
ya and I don't even know what type of taste or do they even have this
ya some more like clothes hard
cause I don't know whether he will like my taste
but he chose to wear it that's the thing it's
no he won't wear purple he say Barney
what serious ah
meh
exactly he is
you know got like those like slim fit regular fit all then I don't know all this guy shit
that's the easiest
err clothes then you have to take into
size the design whether it fits
ya
how is he coping now
in the new work and all
mm
huh
that's true
ya
mm
it's okay lah one day I see him lah slowly
uh
okay lah but maybe my next like three day off I ask him out
but then I scared he go dating ah
cause if he's free he will usually go dating what
do you like study math anymore no right
eh why you don't want to teach the our neighbour anymore ah
mm
because like I heard the kid is really struggling as well
ya and then like he needs to take next year and then
he skip his grades are doing really bad right now
so he really needs help
tuition centre
then it like didn't help him then she don't want to teach him also
people outside seh
ya
but he play with my soft toys
like when he was sick he hug
Didi the dinosaur
and stuff like that
like a little sick cause his mum didn't want him to skip tuition
oh my god I think was only fifty
ya last time you also got paid fifty right
no it was never seventy
it was always fifty Erra
ya that's why I stop
is like about ten ah eleven
or twelve dollar plus
ya still not worth it
some more he's very naughty but
make it to like
make it well
yes true
but then that's not the end right
ya
you don't even do that much
but they still revamped a lot right
ya
but
people private affairs seh
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
relationship I mean
ever since primary school secondary school and days
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex ah my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell um
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students seh but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that seh and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
so traditional
I don't know lah
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
huh it's not it it's not
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
master or what
no lah sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then oh ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
don't know
oh my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay lah whatever you young but never mind ah
but she cannot handle the team well seh
I remember she just graduated from and then she was
looking
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums seh
I remember so many people vomited ah
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what eh I remember she do the stupid like
err push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know ah
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
err the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports until
soccer right
eh
uh I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop seh
and like I I feel it's not normal
huh
like I'm really glad that we actually did sports last time
cause in some way or what
help to
discipline us and make us stronger ah
but actually it's quite bad seh it's like you're not healthy you know
ya
anyway what kind flowers do you like
ya

cause you're like actually attracting insects
cause of the seed
especially when they are like rotting rotting eh what's the word eh
wilted yes for real
wiltering ha ha

so that bothers you ah
mm
I see
don't know I also like you like fifty fifty

hard to take in a stranger into your home and make it a home for them
you know what I mean

I also hate children
ya meow meow I love cats
like they are so cute and tiny I would like
like take seven of them
in

like
it's like it will fill the void ah

you don't know meh our Singapore zoo so many animals dying so they keep on saying don't support
zoos

oh okay lah true lah
that time I got go one at Indonesia kan
it's like
they are living in the wild which is really good I love I love animals to live in the wild you know
but I feel that they're not being fed enough

what if they hungry then they eat the tourists
I just scared for the animals

owe a vehicle
the cheapest is about sixty thousand eh
crazy eh you know sixty eight K in another country can buy
two three cars I think

it's just the car
ya but then like other cars I see like two hundred thousand then got until one million all ah
then like even housing in singapore
is so expensive
then they said that maybe getting a condo
is better than getting a at this rate
cause of the facilities
and like condos kan
most of them the new ones are built near like
you got see uh is it Gueenstown or Redhill
the new condo right is directly opposite the
and it looks really good
ya
ya
it's small
but ya you win some you lose some
I think condos right the small small ones is like suitable for those that is like living alone or with just a partner you know
but if you have a family then maybe the executive condos or something ah if you're rich
in like the richer side of Singapore
it's like whoa living the K drama life seh

mm
ya so
it's a nice place I've read about it
the our master bedroom ya
mm what you want later I buy after this I buy
I you know I want I want the the err flashbacks right one says that time so ya you know you don't like to name you you maybe you will you not so impressed by the new version but I think it was good

orh we went when we had the car right we rented the car over there ah ya ya ya we went inside before the inside with aisyah oh really
for good
oh
on weekdays a bit hard lah
mmhmm
putri ah
the son work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive eh and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's err very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them uh checklist err time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time lah
this is the the the obviously the border town but I think it's the same as greece their orthodox christian ya
what is your opinion on aldemir
is he is he a good guy a bad guy or just no opinion ah
I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very err it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king faisal the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
of what
what's on oh they watching or what
by who
the government
they're pragmatic lah ya ya
okay this is asking for trouble
he is lucky he didn't get shot eh honestly

he's not gonna get in

hello hello

my cousin who went to korea before he said that ah it's super duper cold he went there during winter so so it's super duper cold so if you want to go there during winter better get prepared like
all the necessary staff for you to stay warm so I'm like ya it it's interesting ya for me but ya to your question it will be spring spring is my I think it'll be
tour guide in singapore I mean singapore got a lot of interesting and like places to go but if I were a tour guide I will bring them
it's very interesting question ah I'll bring them
to
uh oh my god
I say there's a lot of places but I can't think err err
oh ya okay maybe ya ya maybe if you want to
ah I remember you know the masjid sultan area what do you what what what area is that ah
ya okay I was I was thinking of what's
err kampung glam
five stones they have five stone ah they have five stones and they have like they have this handmade paper plane
and then they have another one with the handmade ah where you it's a paper ball where you need to blow on it and then in order for it to to expand then make into a round shape then you can just you know play it around like that
from what I heard from my friends like I'm more to like the old side of of like I mean ya I'm that I I give that kind of vibe to them lah like I I really like oh like old school style like you name it like for me like it's very very fun and interesting for me ah
happy family you mean yes
oh I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of uh you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends um she suggested me this one at at that point of time of the year ah the title was boys over flowers
it brings me back so much lah like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like ah
they I mean they have a lot lah but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
oh I like
we watch the same thing ya ah kitchen nightmares
oh those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's ah go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like wah like wah you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
err how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say lah
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like ah
like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
oh ya ya ya
movies
uh
oh movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one lah I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting what
eh it is so good I wish I wish uh I could you know get that that kind of uh if it was to exist in singapore lah or in anywhere like like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you

how ah you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good what
oof cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I I remember I had
tinky-winky is the purple one the first one with the red handbag

ya that's ya I mean like ya
of course of course yes yes
ah titanic
err it'll be money health and food
I mean kan it's important in everyday life what you need to eat to get your energy to get to start your day and everything so food
ya that's just a wish lah but ya money and health health of course health is very important for us lah as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all ah ya oh I have another question for you
ah
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
ya for me it will be err read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean ah you know
ah food it's always about food ah in the end it's always ah it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too lah what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
alright so how about ah
K got another question for you okay err
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya ah okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
exactly
interesting

so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
err oh I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found uh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting

I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful uh peaceful what do you call ah called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like

I mean it depends on the person practising uh
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like ah
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever

I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand

closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting ah country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say

ya that's the thing I I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard lah to say but then I mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of err

it's a small group lah not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then um the place also okay lah not so busy last time used to be very busy but now um because of the COVID thing so companies send their
ah their staff
a participant they only allocate uh fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like err two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
oh I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the err
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
I don't know because the deal is um they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges lah
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
um the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge ah one que
and one and then myself doing um
but surprisingly all the participant came for
ah
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
mmhmm
ah she ah panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause uh every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and um
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
level
which is different lah this today's it's so much different from the past
ya
she's a bit timid lah I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister lah but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really lah
timid is different from people who is fierce shah timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
ya she went through all the assessment
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that uh these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but err she turned to me and tell me of like um
mm mm
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you um
cute lah but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no um
uh huh
uh huh
you didn't
mm
mm ya
mm
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
mm
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much ah maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
um
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
oo
uh sooner or later she she will forgot how to err right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the uh leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad lah mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
um
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
um
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
the because people don't go through
so it's gonna be the same
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put err into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got um cousin lah she could say ah eight boys ah the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be err medical attention given to her ah anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then err third she got um caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver mm they have
err nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know um half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday err maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so lah because she's already bedridden
um don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this um
that's that's what my opinion is lah
ya I know
mm
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this err dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya lah I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
oh eh you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
old generation lah
err
mmhmm
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
you know like like like specially our money ah nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
that's problem lah people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right err your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card err see see and then err this this lady said hey you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is err err giving some uh help fund because I really apply then is it oh you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true mm how to accommodate right
um
um
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious lah I think the more points of
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite um err
complex lah I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
um I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
um I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at err until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't uh take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
you mean you're not used to it that uh you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
ah sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
ah contribute no that's what I think lah
I I mean right now this is
uh right now right now right now at this situation that I um
at present ah most of my err friends
mm
oh you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
um ya
um how you want to err how you
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that oh it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
um
um ya true
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really ah really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand lah
um that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
you know so quickly the other
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
ah
now it's a time for them to take care of me
or as what you say lah don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
I have the capability lah
the
um mm um
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have err your energy level is our only that point of time eh is that much
and then you have feeling ah that ah you are human that you know that uh sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this
err emotional otherwise you're not human you are not robot it with you robot
mm
forever ya forever you be
ya
um ya true true
ya true
mm ya
breakdown
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
um um
somehow you were saying that family knows best lah
okay err family know best in terms of tackling one err let's say the mother lah because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming err since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
trial and error also
um ya true
um
so because chicken
oh complain and complain
mm oo mm mm
oo
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
um
mm ya
ya true ya true
so it would so when you have a when you have to take care of a dementia person you make sure that you always do uh a lot of research
research and research because dementia not only happen to our community our it happen to the world so every everyone in every everyone in
I should say the world world the global global it's a global err
phenomena is going to be as what they say pandemics you knows
ya correct ya true okay that's about all thank you

one
oh nevermind lah
oh no lah I was just looking at the jurassic mile
um
I think track in changi airport
today or some some some time maybe I I dah
err is it sedap mania or something quite cheap right if I'm not wrong
err
have have they got those suggest sliced beef
ya
a'ah
ya
so
ya
hafizah
most likely ah
oh he he came back he had something on is it just now
oh
so um
oh ya we can do that also oh
but lucky got sinopec lah
anyway
dining in the garden ang mo kio ah

oh
oh jinjja eh

how big is it
ya

satay soup base
huh really
oh
oh
oh
oh
err
so
so far
in the future
so
uh
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits lah
so what do you think how about you
huh serious
ya lah ya lah
ah
alcohol
things that
are not allowed lah in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead lah with it
segregate your assets lah so I think one good err platform to that we can use is
I as far as I know this is the
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
uh
um and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
uh forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
oh okay so like
err ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge lah then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside lah of of using
wahed invest
um
how to say eh
what err things you have to face lah if you want to go through the halal way
ya so you have to put up lah with this all these service charge lah when these banks
new way
true
do it the halal way then it's the best lah
ah correct
a'ah deep
ya correct lah I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
okay lah ya
jalan kayu ah
I okay

ya that's true ah I think we will still keep the bike in the long run
ya but until you are old and grey
really

march oh ya ya ya march march
I know but the month is ya but the month is different
really
ya but still that's a month apart what it's not the same date what
I don't know ah let me think about it ah I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that ah which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home ah cause the home is a bundled family thing what
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
oh
singtel is so expensive
obviously not enough for you
ya but are you still like eligible for the data usage or is that
but with no sub charges ah
oh chey how sure are you
oh but you cannot change to singtel
same like ayim right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay lah
don't say that you don't know though
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya sia it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what oh you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course lah someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like uh
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish what
make the computer understand this language
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like
like what are your dreams what if you can
exactly these are conversation stoppers these are not conversation starters you know when
ya she's okay she stops vomitting she's very happy she wants two cake her
I like it though because it's not because she
I like it I like it that she knows what she wants
ira jer ah

my money is not off yours so hey that's not nice ya but whatever I can just transfer it back to me

ya
no but I want to be a balance of both I want them to actually think we are so good
whatever dude
at the same time we have a lot of overlapping so we have to get that not so much ah
means when I speak you want to speak when you speak I want to speak

I
ya
you know there's a red line which means you spoke too loud was it you or me ya
no because you went you won't see then it did it got shock

then it came off then what's the point
ya that's true ah and then are you gonna finish up the star wars
okay why don't we try one question
ah please the questions are quite fun okay um
I remember the question was mm if you had a superpower what would the superpower
what would you want as a superpower
I think I want to read people's mind do I really hmm
what would you want the superpower to be
ya
fly
that's not a superpower dude
because he's rich
ah
really such a
oh ya that's true technically iron man also no but he has that stupid heart thing that doesn't function oh is it oh that's his flaws
ah
I don't know actually if I have a superpower I think if I have a superpower I will travel back in time
dude mine is the most superpower among your rich rich is not a superpower
no
what
no who say you can buy people uh oh my god the person who's gonna vet this conversation is totally gonna judge you for saying that
your superpower you want to be rich and that you want to buy your wife what the hell is wrong with you
your wife
I'm not gonna let you buy me
with money
I don't fall in love with people because of money
actually mm I don't know what a superpower be
then another one more was
last
huh one week why
that's not one week that's just about three days
ya
ya then rizal got stabbed then what else happen
oh ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
err
ya exactly so which means ushu have to still like be in good terms with them what
rahman sia
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house what
that's very um vague ya
is there really circumstances like this
ya lah that's true ah
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it ah meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say eh I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
huh
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting ah as in like they bought themselves a resale
I don't know lah he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand lah could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know lah I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
mm ya
ya lah true
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the de la salle
five years of course ah he's like that what which is good ah I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around choa chu kang area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works sia
alhamdulillah
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
inshaallah no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block what
ya probably lah
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to but okay lah also not bad
can he go
ya lah that's true
inshaallah inshaallah
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to schools do they
ya like
ya but because it's catholic school what de la salle is a catholic school
so
oh ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else oh I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya lah that's true see how lah I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
eh dude
eh
what's wrong with that it's good what to be prepared

in that so all the best for the business hopefully you will be rich and I will be your first customer
and in some in some ways try to pay all the credit card debts and hopefully my own car loan and things like that so that's my goal I was thinking of I want to save more money err ya grow my own food so don't have to buy so many so so much food and pay the debt lah

at such a young age I was thinking like I was nineteen years old eh how old are twenty one I was doing what oh I was in
eh actually no lah twenty one I was already doing theatre I already acting
I started at nineteen what
um after I was bored then I decided to sign up for all
then I said okay then nineteen years old I went to audition
I was doing backstage work
they need a dead body but actually that role right can just use a dummy you know actually can just use anything ah is just the thing doesn't move you know the dead body doesn't move
lie there then after that I say okay so um it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay lah my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
and um
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try lah two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
watching the show and then um second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like astaghfirullahalazim she was like

no lah actually before before that happens
uh take over whoever's not here lah so I was just doing my job very well lah whoever I'll remember how they perform then I try to replicate exactly how they do it
so that was my first acting ah and then because of that I was confident to audition for young and wild for rice for
theatre artistic and theatre practice theatre practice was the first one first show that I ever did ah

that post has influenced people to buy the programme also what okay we also don't know

relax jer just just sound
no lah don't force it lah don't force it
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
alah that one
um
okay lah but
that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
ah
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing lah I want to grow up I want to become
um
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course lah that
um
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why eh oh I know why
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no lah no lah no lah it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got err theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful lah
and I wasn't doing very well in eh no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry eh no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
uh attended this lah you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
like that ah so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay lah give you more job ah then now I started learn
um
uh
like other skills lah like I've got to learn more about it
teaching then after now now I realised what is my purpose lah
mm
oh you went to watch that one ah ya it wasn't my first show lah but it was the first show that probably you watch
mmhmm
okay
mm mm
mm
ah ah
ya I mean I I love the show ah really I really help her but then
wah this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more uh but ya got big issue lah that one until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that like in a way I have to give advice lah it's really about you say lah your marketing
to win your audience um
the how whether they can the whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
mm then how you guys do it
mm
mm
let's try one of these prompts lah ha
mm
okay
okay
they always sell the masala chai in um
very tiny cups but I think is less than ten cents if you think about it in singapore dollar in dollars
the chai but in that cup the big cup huh can I I say ya ya ya
I I don't know I'm just addicted to tea lah so but I like ah masala chai ah you like tea right
um
chai basically is tea what
delivery alamak
okay
is it still continue it's not it's not uh okay
maybe
one food
and meets all so all the health requirements something like the vegetable
err
something with protein and carbs enough all
I mean if it's for survival
if your if your if I think about if you think is probably for survival lah but if I for indulgence
what would be the worst buy one get
huh what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
I just say for one is for one right buy one get one free
what would be the worst idea for that kind of sale
what about fringe
why would you need two fridge
buy one get one eh washing machine actually maybe one for whites one for coloured can make sense it can make sense
no lah but it's it's it's buy one get one free what
ah okay okay compare compare
okay okay okay
uh okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mm if you can
master three new skills what would they be
then
oh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
oh
on purpose
why ah
oh eh okay okay
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill uh I want uh
um
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will lah ah
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move ah
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie ah a fighting film ah
cool lah but mm
and I don't like to fight ah
ya but then no lah I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
eh you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no lah just uh uh uh generic
um a lot of the but uh just basic ones lah very introduction to all the different therapies lah
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
okay if you can like you said okay can lah you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay lah two weeks right
but some people they might say that
eh
dare to ask me we're not even that close um you know
you know
um
we take that example is not a very good example lah like one uh like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
um
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that lah but then
in the end um
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
so I'm learning about that ah so it's very uh and I err so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
you clothes around ah you know it made me feel uh like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel um
that
uh you feel lah
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that lah I
if you could pick up your own stuff
um
would you be doing it lah am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well lah okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay lah you ask me then I can say yes I can say no lah
ya it's like a demand kan to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how ah how to
balance that out I try to figure it out lah
ya but won't
mm
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
mm
mm
ya I see hard ah
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
um
but you are following your dreams kan
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know I just only last you kinda kinda nearby indonesia in canada africa you occurred under its eco guy causing like you do
so formal
who do you speak with usually
mm mm
that
that's not real lah it's not the code is not the what to say
mm mm
language
mm
mm mm
mm
oh no
recording interrupted
oh let's pause first oh shoot
okay lah it's fifty five minutes fifty six seconds
err nevermind let me ask her uh
oh no okay uh
let me ask
hi my recording got interrupted
at the fifty five
minute
fifty six seconds mark
okay let me settle
should be okay lah alright nevermind we just submit this one lah
oh stop stop stop

hmm three wishes right
I want to help the poor maybe uh I feel that err it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then next uh the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes furqan
uh
my views on what your wishes are it's actually uh is very good from what I see you are a people person like err like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at tampines I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like err taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say uh for example I I share an example ah
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food uh food court I teleport to the place
then after that uh I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay err you said it can increase because the person uh didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so err let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about err going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and uh maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's uh maybe uh the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
we only expose to the office
ah which is easier to contact tourists
it is uh something
err
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know err be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
err I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one err mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of uh being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe uh act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but err
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it uh
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that err you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to uh ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that err you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means err if a person is a father
okay so err what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of uh two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man uh should isolate himself
for months
I feel uh I I agree to a certain extent err where
let's say this person have uh no responsibility maybe uh no parents no siblings no children no wives then uh I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say err okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example uh a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
actually err pretty similar ah on on the investment part because err actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves err a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
err
if you were to tell me that investment is uh is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe err last time I was maybe too good ah I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society err when they see oh a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much err about monetary err maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old err ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more uh gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this uh money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go uh anywhere that I want because err there's a certain level of err financial freedom I would say
second topic
oh my my memory memory is err degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
oh I admit uh do you have you heard of uh about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep uh items
or uh photos ah to then err to keep in a secret place or maybe err some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video err it's like a conversation with uh my old my my oldest self so let's say err my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually err when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so uh I just hope I don't lose the video lah actually I don't even remember where is it now
hmm I like to be famous yes
but
but uh I think is uh if I were to take myself a picture of myself err every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
one of the nicer waters in uh asia that uh that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic err trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so err I think there is err what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of uh funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that err short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then uh another err much more serious err
uh experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me err makes me err
then err maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was uh I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that err jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to uh go into uh into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then err
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that err it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually err and even err just now I was riding a bike
err due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so uh I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
uh
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
err someone is err or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of err delivery riders who is uh riding very recklessly around uh uh on the road ah because they are
err chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe uh road uh sorry uh lorry drivers lorry drivers
err less trip
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because err err when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example err if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can err plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering uh maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that err we are not so err I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe uh three hobbies one is err maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start err ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
err I would know I'm I'm not really a good uh soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because err I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that uh soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me err easily when whenever err people especially uh in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said oh let's play soccer outside
uh this way you gain uh relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and err in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems err I think is is is quite interesting
err
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some err activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure uh how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because err in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals err so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less err how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think uh as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
err
so far I think eh all the err hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from err we are kind of uh similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers

popeyes okay lah for popeyes

okay toodles

yes
uh
ya I remember I saw the vinny guy lah and I can tell that he is very self-aware that people are talking about him ah
so I remember like just looking at him then like I was looking at shu then I was like eh
maybe we just go closer look ah then we we I don't know whether I was being very loud or he's just that attentive to people around him right but he was looking at us
then I was looking at him then I wanted to like um you're the shit bag who is having a weird relationship with this russian lady that is telling people how to do burlesque
err
and straits times so I was like thinking oh shoot I should have like told shu about it lah cause shu is always searching for
like articles to write about and it's going to like help her a lot more to err
like at least advance ah cause she's telling me that like right now she's just taking what people give her and like she
or if you yourself have something nice to talk about and can you know I can set it up you can be famous
do you know that shura is like two years older than me right like she's like my age right
wait that's this is a good question would you ever date someone younger than me
ya
I'm twenty four this year
I'm twenty four lah
and you're almost thirty
ya
no as in
you're twenty nine years old this year would you date her
what the heck
I can tell that you have uh very very no filter
my goodness
and that's something a fact that I wish I could change
err when she want to move ah because the house is bought
but she needs to move out by end of the year I think
eh no no she needs to move out by next she needs to
move out by next year june or march
showed me and mum the other day when I was at her house
because nobody loves you
just want to put it out there
ya anyway um
we brought madrina in the conversation
err what's the word ah uh
or maybe that is a
going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to
she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
err a few days
after my birthday ya
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like
couldn't freaking leave me alone then like I was trying to shake him off
can I come the next day
and that stuff
nazri
I can tell I can tell that you you
wow so deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from shura and all my other female friends as possible
mm no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
mm mm maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
is the liberal one is the consecutive
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
oh my god reminds me of the remember when um
running man was super big and then running man running man
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
so after that um
we noticed there was a lot of err people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
jia hui jia xing eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
I remember um
so mister jamal he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
trumpist I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter ah I have no idea lah that trumpet players ah like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world lah like he told us that
err he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because err back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown lah
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that ah
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in err chicago lah
so he would play the trumpet and then his
um his
friend would play the piano
so err I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior lah who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister jamal right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this ah
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts lah
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
err the
like the ah because he was wearing those
err
football jerseys ah like those what cowboys ah patriots
okay I know that
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of kasanaz I'm sure you remember kasanaz
so kasanaz's husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer ah to the point that
they live in singapore but by right kasanaz doesn't need to work
kasanaz is like apparently like got money kind of like girl lah but I believe the husband is those
chief engineer or something ah like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time ah
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
kasanaz knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that wei xiang is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like wei xiang first of all right
you and me ah
ah both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university lah
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense lah since you like you
somehow educated lah most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties ah who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs ah
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the err the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in lah
so ya lor
I believe he's just a cashier
mm
you know err he used to intern for supply chain for
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
err so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company eh you intern for like a really
big
err
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay lah no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip ah
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also ah
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example temasek right temasek holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance err teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with temasek then we were like bonds ah
you know shares right you can buy like hundred ah
yes so it's really like you need to have money ah
ya
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away lah but
it's a bit sad lah like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan lah the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years ah I have one lah
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money mah and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents ah cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad lah quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what lah those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever lah so I'm just like
why
the I remember it's quite insane lah like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue lah
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome ah
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
err
wei xiang was quite a
like not say an advocate lah he was quite a
this at this
restaurant at this then wei xiang didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists uh near the library
yes
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat meh with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no lah so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was uh didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the uh boyfriend was studying ah architecture or something ah
and then the boyfriend he's err
he's got money lah he's rich I forgot what the father does ah
err the father quite strict with the money ah
like I remember the father once said that
err got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten lah then the father got so pissed the father said
err
since you on the aircon after ten right err ah your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
um divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
I think the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings ah
I don't know
I don't know lah
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so wah talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go jakarta one
second thing right they always go jakarta on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
jakarta right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
dubai or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
mm go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money wei xiang give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them ah but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can lah one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no lah you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be dee kosh
don't prey on kids
seriously dee kosh is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
err okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew lah his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me eh raf want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called lah then he was like oh my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking dee kosh then I'm like huh what you dee kosh wants you to model for him ah he's like no dee kosh wants to suck my then I'm like
eh wait wait wait wait wait eh you don't anyhow hor
then he show me the like the text lah so I was like
you're this guy is insane eh you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am dee kosh your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like oh you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that um
like then later on he'll be like oh like err
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars lah
no obviously I don't know dee kosh I'm telling my friend that
no so um I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal lah hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid lah there are apps and all these mah
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these lah cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people mah like
no one agreed to this ah and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this ah so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
it's the same as uh you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
a'ah the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said ah is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal lah you can't like solicit sex for cash lah I believe
that is
wrong lah like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong lah I don't know how how wrong it is lah in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due err not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not lah
I don't know right is not a good enough um
answer to to evict you from like err
like
a a sentence ah it's like that there was this guy who
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone err he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
err with drugs ah that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge lah he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious meh for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
it's err it's not a good enough err like what you call it
defence ah the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
he the guy never say or whatever right ah
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
err lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine lah like the person cannot say because the person lied mah
and the person tricked you into it but dee kosh I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that oh I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only mah
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly lah but like people like
influence ah
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific lah social media influences ah
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle lah
that's between the followers and them ah some people will like ah it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and ah you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense ah like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this lah but we don't empower him to do the things he do mah
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram ah Instagram empowers him lah Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things ah
nicole choo
yes
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is ah the world evolves in this way lah so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition lah everything like happens because something happens mah
so like it's just evolution lah like something ee the previous generation must have done right has created this lah
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it lah I feel like I created monsters
which is true lah I remember she was the first
real socialite lah because before kardashian there was her what
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich eh like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite ah she's like those
rothschild
like what
legendary families ah like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
um
uh can't really think of any other people like right now lah but
and all of course all your shakes ah
how do I put it lah like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it lah it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes ah to tell people like what they're doing is wrong lah if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it lah like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
it's just the content
that you you don't like which is like everybody's taste lah I personally don't like any of these people lah like to me my
I will always be like if there was a foodie influencer will be like oh there's this thing that just opened nearby in singapore like pancakes or whatever then I'll be like no lah I mean if I'm
err I'll go down to town and buy it lah if I think that the price is worth or anything but not a big fan of like all these
what challenges lah what I put inside my bag lah my house
tour lah how much money is in my bank lah my mother underwear what colour lah
like there's no need for you to advertise your life so don't you think like
in a sense right is this isn't a phenomenon that just occurred you know this
trend right exist in people right throughout the ages
people who
they're bored they have nothing better to do they just want
to some people they just want to really they just want to share their
their lives lah they just really want to share with people and some people might be
very interested like
I would say that if I have a interest in err
in a certain like celebrity or something like
would I be interested in
life eh when he on a day that he has fights
the fighters and stuff like that
or he calls or like you know like what is it that day in the life of like
err
an person or something like this kind of thing wouldn't you want to know
like what is the what is the prep like for a person before he goes on a mission
how do you how do you
measure productive right
in in in in in like in accordance to
like how useful it is ah it's content
I have no idea I've never I've never watched his videos
they have the power of
humour humour and story telling ah
no lah the target market is people from like
twelve to eighteen

mmhmm
mm
uh it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's uh the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer lah
then uh I have there's a whole checklist of things lah that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
err groceries she have to go to a few uh supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing uh all within her area
so it can be like anything lah depends on the product they are doing the survey for
to actually err
err do a survey on the product pricing
mm
mm
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result lah responses ah
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
but it was just like say uh one retailer then I think two three usually it's three and more lah three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred lah is only but it's the pay is good lah for that time
outlet kan then um
ya
uh price about it it's the same lah because it's the same retailer pe
and then err I had uh my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper lah like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience eh
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything what at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so err it was interesting then after that err
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them lah then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya lah but then no choice what and then is this this is like uh you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also uh
they they know that mean their their company already inform them lah like
maybe informed the manager lah not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
that kind of thing lah they don't say like mystery shopper lah maybe surveyor lah
ah they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one uh uh a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
mm
then too bad lah then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know lah that this week uh got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
uh customer service you know that they can give but then uh other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that lor
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
one year eh
mm
oh my gosh
mm
it's like part time ah
oh
wow
okay
mm
mm
just nice
mm
ya lah
that's why
mm
mm ah ah
mm
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
mm
ya but
wah that's nothing new lah because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game ah
mm
mm
mm
and then like uh my friend was saying ah like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good lah
ya lah no it's more than ten I think
mm
true lah
ya lah
mm
ah
mm
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
mm
oh
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance ah like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only ah
ah
mm
orh
ya lah
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
mm
mm
oh but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
mmhmm
huh
ah
wow lucky sia
hmm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya lah
oh ya
ya ah
mm
ya lah like they have to save cost lah if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like uh reduce the
the
the rental right ya lor
mm mm
why
mmhmm mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
mm
oh my god
mm
mm
oh so interesting
mm
oh
ah okay
mm
oh
ya lah
mm
ah that's smart
ya lah
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outsiders eh
mm
ya lah ya lah true
mm
oh he's staying alone now is it
mm
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
mm
ya lah true
ya lah ya lah
mm
but it's good lah I mean like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also ah
and then uh we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in eh
and
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see lah like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then uh don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking lah but
yesterday I I just yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin ah so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and uh and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel uh travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know lah but my whole company is like they freeze travel lah
like for to do travel booking lah visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
mm
mm
ya lah crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing lah basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter eh
from like ah ah headhunter agency eh no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
mm
mm
ya lah
kan I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight ah I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got uh really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya lor makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is uh four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can lah wei cause uh like more senior level lah like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky lah they get a very easy boss
with
eh you never know you know my previous company there's this one err uh E old she's not just senior she's also old
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do lah
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
ah yes yes yes they say golden handshake lah but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department eh
because obviously you are being paid too high lah and people have eyes to see what so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall lah like too bad
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every uh I think september october period she will go
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
uh
oh my gosh ya lah she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive lah because she's such she's so rich eh
mm
ya lah
mm
ya lah that's why I was like uh oh my gosh like so some people are so lucky
oh she's been there for a long very long lah usually those uh who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
mm
mm
really ah
mm
mm
ya that time my friend got told me the uh one of her experience kan
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the or something then she was then the but she already got the authority lah the the boss will give her the supplementary card eh but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever lah whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her uh eh later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like wah so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool lah like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
uh ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's uh he already ask me to pass you I was like
mm
ah ah
uh huh ya
oh
mm
mm
mm
wow
mm
mm
huh
oh my gosh
mm
mm
mm
ya lah at least can just must tell him right
ya lah irritating because usually when they travel it's uh company what so but they can accumulate their own points
haiya
ya lah
oh
mm
mm
ya lah that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing one then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one ah
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right ah okay then we can get the cheapest ah like more less less risk
ya lor
mm mm mm
cannot lah cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because uh it's I think oh that one is because the name
the name is uh typo error or something typo
but it's so irritating seh because we went back and forth then I was telling them like uh when oh no the
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
back button ah
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one ah the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name what I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly what
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like oh shit
auto fill so uh I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill lah
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
anyway so I still have to pay ah I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited ah no show ah
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
mm luckily like promotion and cheapest eh
oh I go and book I go and book because it was like so many people travelling eh and then I like I get so confused I think at that time I was doing like
seven eight people from my team then uh after that there's like three other people that it's not from my team also I have to do
three others lah uh there's no three of them supposed to be travelling from that night right from vietnam to singapore three of them supposed to take the flight the same flight oh
from the company uh book for us and the three of us supposed to travel together ah
for tomorrow night instead of tonight and did you know that three of us are really at the airport and two of them is waving goodbye to him now because I'm stuck at the vietnam airport
he cannot leave as per what I've already booked for him
panic sia but luckily like
to spare for me because when I called them they say don't have
she she ya she book for me the wrong date and I didn't check and now I'm stranded in vietnam and I can't attend the meeting which he the day that he was supposed to be back in singapore ah
ya lah
kan
ya lah true lah
timing as if you take the next day afternoon flight which is much shorter time in the plane eh
I was like no I just inform the finance uh girl accountant
vietnam airlines I think ya lah
then die die also want to travel the next day but must be earlier must be earlier
ho chi minh ho chi minh
like coincidentally that day really like everything is like I mean that I really have no other seats eh no seats at all
crazy
five star and must be really according to his type of room and must be smoking room he's very particular eh
two colleagues is waving goodbye at you and you are supposed to get on the same flight and then
and they are leaving you at the airport and you are stranded without a hotel and a flight
but actually they they pass everything to me then I was like I cannot you tell me at five on a friday and you want to fly I think some of them flying on saturday some flying on monday eh
ah
mm

mm
mm
mm
so he take ya lah ah that's why some is his people her people some is my people right it's like different team kan

after that he we can still like laugh about it that kind but when work is like he's very serious ah but okay lah
after that my friend was like eh I cannot book then I was like eh I got two I still got two rooms you know at hotels dot com it's still uh showing available
mm
mm
oh no wonder
mm
mm
eh like like can't you all like plan earlier is like so painful so I I'm quite thankful that it's COVID now so no travel
but once COVID is over I'm like wah
every time I do travel like so messy seh
ya but it was very funny uh but now now that the travelling stopped for awhile right I think when once it start again I need to refresh refresher courses
mm

that's why it's like but I'm just very thankful like so far up up till now it's still okay lah but I'm just say I'm just
counting my days lah I won't be lucky forever I'm just
ya lah

because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya lah then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya lah then how to bribe
ya lah
but if you poor who want to bribe for you if you kill the person with you who want to bribe for you

in the sense that
you are answerable for your own

then
I tried what once then I feel like I cannot
but then I say lah because when I see a people a girl wearing niqab err I have expectation on them ah
a'ah lah
what to expect

religion

ya ringarde I don't want to be ringarde

hey nurul
thanks for coming here
ya I want to know right mm
what is your ideal vacation like
oh for me kan I think I I really love planning I have to like
I have to know where I'm going I have to know what time I'm going I have to know what time this place close I I love
planning and then I
ya lah for me I'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
and then I also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
this small staff lah these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then I don't know
cause I never gone through that ya oh mm so I wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about I say first then maybe I give one then right
gardens by the bay I'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because uh
it's to me it's one of a kind ah and then like uh so many different
see experience all the different species in one area lah in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the kampung glam area
ya about the old school stuff like uh sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya oh ya and I want to know mm which genre of drama or show do you enjoy the most
for me I really like err
drama like between people I mean I prefer uh movies lah because I I usually cannot sit in one to watch series so if I do watch movies I like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
and then like after that uh
um oh there are some reality shows that I like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and I also love catfish
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
then then then that's the thing I like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya I if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun oh then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
uh it's called kahani ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that um
I watch this movie I think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch series let alone I watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time I watch the movie was during work
so err ya it wasn't even during lunch I was just like
yes
ya so like eh I watched this the second time but I didn't see it the first time but this person that I'm watching it with
oh what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
mm
I think
cartoons I don't watch some cartoons that I watch um
I really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
millions of dollars and I only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's I I think it's still very important lah so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters I think my favourite character do I have a favourite character I like big bird
ya so very cool cartoons lah and like just now you were saying about K dramas right so the K dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first uh
first korean drama that I watch and that's also how I got into K pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
um
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
orh ya lah soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like oh he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the ah every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
oh I like this question because I like wishes
uh
oh not a lot of people will say food why why why food
mm
unusual superpowers wah I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya lah that's that's what I want to
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think uh the reading about minds one sometimes uh I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is um
actually why one thing ah why cannot be many things I say education ya
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
oh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that uh people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
eh then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like oh it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
wah so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun lah
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like wah how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
say if I were to play like music or like uh art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true oh then I wanna ask um
mm
think for me mm
four episodes ya and then err the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
to this place
for me I really love concerts leh like it's too bad lah this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
uh then like mm
for me kan my uh
a higher price
ya lah so like for me uh
as a frequent concert goer kan you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that oh my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
think for me my fashion style I always like to uh dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then uh if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and err I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me kan uh
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
so like err personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
ya what is it
I think this one eh your hardest question eh how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like um say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me uh just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
oh I was thinking
mm korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
chey cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane lah so I the so these are the things that I think about when I want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as uh language culture culture I feel like you can adapt to it ya I don't know I don't think there's a country for me that I wanna stay forever I think I like to jump around
like eh quite cool leh like oh and then like uh ya I like
to actually I like to listen to the leaves and the meet in the wind
what about you is there are there any favourite sounds you have
oh that's cool ya flowers really makes me happy also I I don't think I have a favourite flower lah but I I love looking at like baby breath tiny flowers it's like something small it's not about the size but
especially when they're small and then like daisies also ya you remember the daisies that we saw at coney island right wah they were so cool
ya
very cool and like um
so like what kind of flower like do you wish you can plant
ya
so it's very cool to see um err what is this the flower moving
in the wind and then err
so ya lah I really like flowers I also like plant I like nature we all like to relax right it's so cool

oh world of married
what is it about
oh
oh
mm
oh
you know
lately right
I feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like Syamsul Yusof right
I feel very sad for him seh cause like he's like my favourite
it really make me feel sad cause I thought that was the love of his life seh
hmm
but I don't know eh cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if I'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then um
but I just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
uh children I think one of it
uh is a guy one is a girl
then um I know Puteri uh which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
uh divorce right
it really shows that
maybe Syamsul did something ah but I don't know seh
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like um
marriage and everything
and then actually uh on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick eh but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
wah if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
seh like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya I guess
but you know
other than um
like Syamsul Yusof all right
I also remember got this
I think
you know Alif Aziz
and Bella ya I think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
I feel like Alif is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love Bella and Bella has no choice cause Bella is very soft
of loving someone who is
toxic
why but then bella was saying like oh
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
I feel I don't feel um
um scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
mm
but I think it's also because um he
I mean the other girls were like not even
um saying sorry or anything
oh your hair
um I don't know seh I think you should just
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya so you should just go for it ah
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
ah
from ten to to eh
ya
but I have a lot to do so
I don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
uh okay lah but like I feel like food is nicer
ah which make me feel so like
ya
I feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
foodpanda or what ah
ya
oh my dance classes eh
um
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind I mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
mmhmm
then isn't it better
oh ya I don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay lah
you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
maybe but like I feel that everyone
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they chiong last minute or what
I just feel
so lost
as in I chiong last minute but they all very studious like
three
or week four
I don't know seh
but ya and then
oh did I tell you I met
uh our soccer friends
ah our captain remember
ya
ya the same place as me ah
ah my our campus is
ah Dover
ya
ya oh my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
is like a
a website ah where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review ah
ya and I thought of buying it ah cause like
I feel like
mmhmm
why fifty dollar quite a lot what
oh
but I think in your
because you only receive like nine hundred ah spending money how to save
ya
eh I feel that the money that you have
spend for the month
but like maybe okay lah not that
direct nine hundred ah but like
those kind of thing
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
mm I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
orh for Anas eh
ya I mean I feel for Anas right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple eh
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
because
ya you can buy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even Dakshah had to ask him out
mm
ya that's true
depends ah
uh a bit of physics but other than that no
oh did mama tell you that
oh
mm
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also lah I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
um
doesn't work that way you know
oh he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
oh he did huh what did he do
oh
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
orh but how much were you paid per month
huh fifty jer
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
oh my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya lah you can say like oh you want to help the child everything but wow
that progress and also the time spent right
but really marks where you can go
the place where you
make it or break it seh
ya I mean
minahish and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
it's really scary
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
um the
scary ah that how young and how brave are you to do that
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it seh like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever seh
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then they just um try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
secondary school
oh but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
oh
oh my gosh okay
ah why he like that seh
you reminded me of our netball coach
how old was she ah when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
wah early twenties then she act until like that
oh
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
oh when was I there
oh
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with seh
mm
oh my god ya it was during like the
um
exam kan
I mean how we've been overworked
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
oh I know I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her oh my god
err
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma lah to be honest
mm
so supportive and stuff
ya
I
I don't know if you know this Instagram ah it's called Sanwraps
they sell like the cutest combination of flowers bouquet ever like they have daisies they have tulips and then they have roses
ya
ya
wilt wilted eh
wilting eh
ya
and
ya but the anti is spelled as A N T E A
ya
but it's not I don't think it's halal lah but then
they brew their coffee eh no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
a'ah Singapore
huh why you ask me that
oh um
haiya for me
hmm let me think
actually
I know that
like if especially if my husband wants a child
ya
I mean like you can always say oh I will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
that's why
ah
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head ah
ah
ya
I I don't know ah
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
you love cats
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
mm
that's why
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment
because like
they keep rattling the cage and all makes me feel that actually like house all like not
suitable for their environment ah it's like why would you keep them there seh
oh actually ah
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very very similar to those in the wild
oh
mmhmm
I mean those are just news lah I feel that Singapore zoo is like still having some efforts also what
orh

I'm pretty sure the animals are being fed and everything
don't worry lah

is aching

I don't know lah cause if for me if I go to a toilet that I know that is not very clean I will
breathe through my mouth I will I will I will shut the nose and I will breathe through my mouth so I cannot smell anything

stop it lah sia
and I actually tell you I am busy
my hands are like filled
the worker is not the common worker that I work with right
ah
ah
both of you are of the same size same height sia
but ya about the same size
I don't know whatever lah
I mean I just take the pot and just want to place at the location ah
that really is so funny
there are fun moments really there are actually there are many fun moments ah
uh if we say anything wrong or scold you or what right we sorry lah

uh uh sia
then then after that

so okay lah
I want to buy biryani I even ask them you know like
the first few month of COVID
ah bulk ah
mm which eh
as long as you are happy ah
of course ah
when I was in school that's what I learn myself sia B
nobody's gonna teach you this kind of nonsense sia
err I don't know lah they they they I think they don't believe in it ah but for me is I believe in it because build rapport you know why you know why I say this thing is good or not

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
ah
ah okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
mm
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
mm
okay
but you can cook what
okay
mm
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
mm
mm
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
uh good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
mm
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
mmhmm
ya
okay
mm okay
okay
can so
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
mm
okay
mm
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
it's okay I'll ask the second question
um
err
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
mm
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
mm
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
mm
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
uh huh paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane eh
crane
and
and did you like it
mmhmm
don't have courage to try new things
okay
okay
go somewhere else
you say one ah
don't take back on your promise ah
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
oh
okay
uh huh
okay do you have any
mm
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar lah
then you did did you watch incredibles two
mm
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
mmhmm
oh okay okay
then the storyline
mm okay
mm
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
mmhmm okay
then
which superhero movies have you watched
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
mm okay
mm
then
so if you were to
mm
uh huh
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for err err single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal lah his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
plan out their
master err their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no lah professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research what like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it lah and
ya
in school
then wednesday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing lah because many of my friends
they
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different what
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
you mean from my
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different err
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
I like what I'm doing
mm
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education what
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
also
and it's important to start early lah because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also mah
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
eh teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
huh go
after I graduate go
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing lah and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
mmhmm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
anything lah ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
uh huh
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
mm actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
mmhmm
ya
mm
okay
mm
okay then
so
if
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
okay right
yio chu kang all the way
okay
how much are you paying
mmhmm
hundred and seventy seven
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
oh
ya
mm
okay
there's active what
ya
ya
no not pilates lah aerobics
no not aerobics cardio
because
twelve classes
ya group class so uh ya lah so had three class and then because of COVID
ya
okay
ya
ya
mm
okay
ya lah just go for the active one is cheaper lah
ya
mm
mm
ya
I think
ya
I think there is should
but jalan besar maybe
ya have you gone for any active you never gone for you have never gone for an active classes
mmhmm
oh the one at jalan besar swimming pool
uh huh
okay
also very far
mmhmm
mmhmm

mm
okay
mmhmm

so you are improving lah
then are you still going for classes now
mmhmm
okay
okay okay
mmhmm
okay then
err
hmm
what
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
so you will eat bread toast for breakfast dinner lunch everyday for the rest of your life
ya but you will eat that for the rest of your life
bread
uh huh
mm ya
okay so what would it be
breakfast dinner lunch
everyday
that's more than one dish you can only choose one dish
mm
me
why
it's not filling what
if I were to eat one dish for the rest of my life
maybe fried rice
ya
or your mee hoon
the the the dry mee hoon
ya that's the
one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet mee hoon
okay
hmm
so
mandi rice mm
yesterday
come you you try to smoke it but
I don't know I couldn't taste the smoky flavour or anything
ya and that's what I said what the smokiness

mm
okay lah I mean
it's a normal
I can't remember if you made better mandi rice or not
ya
ya do you stuffed it right
ya
mm
when you try to make like with briyani or mandi I like I prefer
when you make simple ghee rice
with like chicken curry and papadum
is either a hit or miss sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work
ya ya
okay lah it's not that bad also it was still good
decent
nex
ya
half half
we ordered half of as in
I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know lah mm mm is to cater to people
so things to let people
have a bit more variety lah
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza uh
the biggest one
it's very filling
ya
mm

I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland ah
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia

ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries what
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange

estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that

true
okay lah I mean we can change slowly lah
ah okay
never mind
we see how we see how
okay then so you mean that you want the same colour but in a different
tone of the colour

how am I supposed to know what which one you like
it's it looks modern
anything that you put on the frame is old school unless you say that you want to have a frame wall that means the whole wall is full of frames
that one I can I can
close one eye lah eh
I can close one eye lah it is up to you lah you want you want that okay lah fine lah
but please do not disturb my
pasting on the wall please
then you think I like it when you want to paste all your frames
it looks like a museum
I don't want I don't want my house to look like museum
precisely that's why I said I close one eye so why can't you just close one eye on one one of the wall

then we make it a store a bigger store room
understand
mm better kan
mm
okay
ya lah of course not not not straightaway lah not straightaway
yup

mmhmm
ya I know
mmhmm
mmhmm
I know
it's built
mmhmm
ya
I know
I know
so
so that we can have three
one two three
ah
mm
but if you open this one
the one that you can slot in right
so that that drawer
you can actually see
a'ah
it's like glass
mm mm
something like that
ya
mmhmm
why would I want to walk again
it's not
ya it's not
mm it's not the as squeezy as that it's not as squeezy as this
it's like
it's like
this
ah
mm
can don't worry
it's not that squeezy
about this size about this wall
mm
no it's not that squeezy
stand ah
I'm not gonna put uh chair down there
mm because beside that
no beside that
ah
correct
beside that mm
so
okay
like if you want to sit down
okay
it's up to you
okay can
this is because this is our stuff
then you can when you open you can see from inside you can see
mmhmm
definitely
mmhmm mmhmm
mm
then ah okay so beside that you have this one
and then my side
side of the bed lah
mm
side pillar
okay
table
just a wall lah
because that is when where you want to
your projector you want to
mmhmm mmhmm
understood
can show
okay
what is it with you and frames
why
no it doesn't
no it doesn't
no it doesn't cheer up the room
it looks like
mmhmm mmhmm
I understand I understand
all the sentimental values and all that I understand it's just that
why frame it
why
why would you look at it
if you put it in album why would you look at it once in a few years
even if you put
you won't look at it everyday what
it's there but you won't look at it everyday
then then like that
no need to have frame lah
feature wall
we are teenagers
so you want to look like old people
mm
I'm not that old
what is that face
and
and
ya I do
and
mm
okay
whatever
okay
take lah take lah take lah take lah
eh then you have your
whole wall then I have
wow
mm
mmhmm
okay
of course
ah I need to check again because the last one I check is ah about
two hundred one hundred to two hundred plus ah something like that
one hundred plus why not
okay then maybe two hundred plus
fine then three hundred it is
okay fine then it will
then I find the
why cannot
if I'm not wrong there's a
uh
price for it
so based on that based on that ya based on that I think is about two hundred plus
true
mm
mmhmm
then say lah you put your price like that what
you advertise five room mah
you advertise five room this this price this price and then now you you come then you want to charge more cannot what
one one five
mm
aiya cincai lah cincai lah
nothing
no I was thinking
I was thinking about
the the things that I saw on their
advertise advertisement
yes definitely
ya
mmhmm
but if you wash the sanitisation will wear off
means wash first no no no no
no when we go and check the house we must make sure that they already clean the house
and clean already the house
correct
built-in
okay
then we need to find housekeeping
because down there they put cleaning and sanitisation you know
no no inside the inside the in Carousell the one that I see it's cleaning and sanitisation
mm
wow you want people to scrub some more then you scrub yourself lah
they will have a special
special
ya
hijack
jet spray
that chemical

so ya
wow
oh interesting
um
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
there lah almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
okay
mm
but when it comes to chicken or duck
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
um
ah mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
is
if I were to be a vegan
and mama
mm
mm
vegan
is is there a certain
mm
mm
I
don't have anything
because of all the free time
um
but actually um
in southeast asia
mm
mm
oh my god
mm mm
mm
mm
ya lah
born born to be slaughtered lah basically
mm
mm
and then
oh okay
start drawing again
err two thousand twenty one resolution
err come back to
I
but
by by time
mm
um
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home lah
ah fully on music then
work from home
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
mm
um
greek
I I
one or two language first lah before ventured out
mmhmm
oh my god ya
mm
mm
so
okay what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
mm mm
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
a total shit show lah
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
mm
mm
mm what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya lah cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
mm
oh but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait lah
um
what else ah
if you go
the the
ah two thousand twenty one
a burst of
creative contents
this this cannot
um go on for too long I have I have to do something to
mm
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
mm
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
mm mm
natural selections
mm mm
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
mm
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
mm
duolingo
mm
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
mmhmm
mm
mm
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
a'ah
mm
mm
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
mm
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
ah
mm
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
mm
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature lah
mm
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
very personal because
mm
mm
mm
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
mm mm
I don't have any other interest
and the new age plato
mm
okay
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called ah the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
mm
the difference
I want to go to greece again
mm
oh in addition to that scandinavian countries
oh ya ya
sweden
oh yes denmark
K lah hopefully next time
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
euro centric okay my apologies
mm
mm
in ruins
mm
ah you you cannot see with your own eyes
mm
running eh
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours wow
wah long silence very long silence
uh huh death to two thousand twenty
but I think it's a good mockumentary lah to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one eh two thousand twenty
mm
and
mm
okay lah if if you could
be your younger self
mm
you know what do you have against schools ah
uh huh
mm
mm
but for you most of that internet lah kan
I think that will help a lot
ah
mmhmm
this one is the beginning okay
mm very anti climactic
okay lah I like new beginnings um
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
oh
mm
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
in a way
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
um
and
you have yourself and people around you
this year
so you
institution
religion
mmhmm
ah
mm
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
mm
mm
that's my vaccine wah
mm
mm
ah ah I wish I wish we can talk about something new lah mm
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K lah thank you
okay

the exams are like cut off about
exam are replaced with err graded assignments
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday ah ah
you design tau like
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
ah
hmm
um
but you know what uh I had this one senior the internship was during the period yes so
no
zoom or ah microsoft teams
oh she is uh in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
ah work from school even internship eh ah ya from home I mean
ah so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
and like even but then right
but then during period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work what
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that what
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then um
actually diff races okay lah
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma ah outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
oh my god
oh you mean secondary school or what
oh primary five then I still in the kindergarten lah
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay ah
but at that point of time I was
I
messenger
true lah
eighteen oh ya
hmm
why is this class not like taking it seriously
not something to be like
like absent for like out of five days leh
three days absent and and even if he was present
he didn't do anything
uh ya so even the teachers know that ah anytime like they had to
no this is like monitress other student monitor cause the monitor doesn't even come
became the prefect then the useless
they like serious lah
like to be honest for me right
I took
and it was the major presentation and it was like err for my grade it was forty percent
it was during secondary four it was during secondary four but then um
for that grade I got a
then um
I don't know like
all of us became much closer
so but for you
like since you already like from primary secondary diploma in uh
poly diploma in uh arabic private school so
passed by
no I think I was too young to remember that
oh oh ya ya yes
vanguard
vanguard ah vanguard
oh
oh
but then how do they split the class like academic results or just randomly split
ah because for my primary school like
like they like
ah separate into our six six
I don't label myself as antisocial
okay
was it a few people or just like
that one person one girl a group ah
oh she put the blame on you you haven't told me this about it
then what did you do
they put the blame on you
no like do your classmates suspect you as the
oh oh okay okay
oh no
oh
then issac was six
oh primary six oh oh but I thought you had someone who you knew
from primary six
okay
varsity jacket
oh that clip okay
so you had to like
oh
and there was this one time it was the it was the guys ah
I mean like canteen
so suddenly we saw someone running to the school gate
they got
it was a punishment
oh ya
like quite
oh ya
I think because right oh my god
oh the exam is in school
oh my god
at someone else right
no I had the same experience because ah during secondary three or secondary four I help with the book sale
so we had the books arranged at the lah so it was only like the four of us
that that lah
suddenly we were like folding something
oh no we were rearranging books to like
make sure that this section is for secondary one secondary two secondary three secondary four
then suddenly we like
no one is at school except for the admin staff and even the admin staff only no it was the other side
ignore this then we just ah started to talk again lah then we heard it again
eh
oh that is actually something ah
um
oh at that time you just ignore certain things ah ya ya
serious
um
retreat ah retreat

oh
bestnya
oh ya adam I think most likely ah
he will be coming
ya ya most likely now he's taking a rest to to power charge himself for later
ya
ya
ya so
oh oh
oh ya ya ya true true true petrol in singapore nowadays very expensive lah
thailand
um ya so
I see I see
ah ya
ah
ya
adam needs more convincing to do lah
ya
err anyway
K
hmm
oh ya hor eh but then now that you say but then I I I just remember right that I saw one telegram that it says err um
have you heard of ah what chick chick shake shake tub
it's like chicken chicken and all
so one is for one dollar
we never go at there maybe we can go there lor check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces wah shiok sia
actually we can two person share one what one person six piece six dollars okay sia right
ya so
satay sauce soup base I was like wah that's kind of cool then maybe we can
mm mm
oh
me ya
I I also don't know lah I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
so
hold a lot of shares tau so I think
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
ya um
um
mm
I see I see
but how much ah the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
mm
ya ya
new um way
so
so
right kan
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity lah because like you know um
eh not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward lah for
that's why I think err
ya possibly because um even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
um maybe there's one thing we can consider lah
so ya
ya so
ya
so um
mm
okay um
I okay
I will try my very best to convince him to go
ya
there also the vibes like very nice you know
mee sua
ya I mean
ya worst come to worst me you adam
ya
ya
ya but the cheapest is two dollar per fifteen minutes
ya
ya
okay um
ya so
ah ya lah
um
so um
okay so we can review about I don't know
business ideas
huh
ya
ya
I don't know lah
oh oh your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
oh okay okay
oh
oh
oh
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine ah
I I'm wondering uh honestly curious
oh interesting eh psychology
wah
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify kan
ya so maybe lah it's the it's the same person lah loves animal right
a lot of careers ya
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
oh mother's gossip
uh maybe we should help lah we should help please tell
so um it's important lah to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized lah in
ah ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday lah
ah sentosa is it
that's how ah we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
so um sentosa maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar ah
you know we can just hang around at sentosa sentosa I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts lor
ah yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort serapong can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say lah they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
oh ya ya how much is it ah
I'm not too sure I really don't
oh ya we can do that also uh I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
err um can lah I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
ya as in eh as in the the timing also lah
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
can also lah because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
err let me see eh err
three rides one blue one orange one green thirty five dollars
I I don't quite understand
so many rides lah but I think it'll be different
madame tussauds
ya green zone so green zone and orange zone one ride is ten token
twenty err twenty token
okay um
hackett the jumping one right fifty five token
there is uh another one ah gogreen segway the segway it's only five token for
thirty minutes one hour ten token by pedal bicycle
ya I think it's okay ten token worth it one hour seh one hour we can it's a very long time lah not bad seh
ya don't have their have eco adventure but I don't think there is kayak
we can take cable car if you want cable car is twenty token
mount faber and sentosa and it's a round trip
so you can take it from mount faber
budding air
ya lah we can oh got mega adventure park um
ya so we ten ten so we get to take err two different attractions lah which I think a bit quite nice eh some more plus cable car then after that
ya eh what is mega bounce mega bounce
bike
aiya I guess not too sure but okay lah we can check there out we can check that out some more I mean we are not paying you know technically it's free so let's just do that
so I mean we we can see lah what else we want but I think to really maximise the segway is good because it's at whole one hour then I think
there will be a tour guide so then you can like literally explore a lot of places in sentosa just by the segway
ya so okay lah so nineteen nineteen so which is this sunday right this saturday right
err
it is the nearest station is tiong baru
and I am like wow not bad not bad not bad interesting
oh eleven to fifteen december
so ya segway so we segway for one hour
basic ah seh
ya original price eighty nine dollars
or one mega jump then
err actually we can do the also lah the is ten token
you know it's not bad ah usual price twenty two dollars
eh actually this one better if you want we should go for the sea aquarium tour ten token then the other ten we go mega bounce lor
ya more better than one hour jer
yup yup
ya bike got a lot of things lah then maybe you know sit somewhere carry marrybrown if you wanna
or marrybrown or or or we can just go ce la vi eat aspirasi mah
we can go the ce la vi hawker centre eat the aspirasi
so we can just ya we can just probably do that lor
so oh my god

the belief is the hell note is to bribe the guardians of the hell gates then ya that's what I heard lah
ya but you steal is
you steal is because you need to survive kind tau
but if you rich then you got a lot of sin you need to bribe a lot that's right
but islam is very fair
ya let that's why you have to prepare yourself that's like another question
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
ya lah
ya
ya but they always say that the paradise is not for the good people it's for the sinners
who repent ya
kan but I think all these all these people all these typical
people in our community makes it
you guys are judgy bunch
mmhmm
ya
kan
ya lah
that was the thing that was flying
I don't know maybe
okay
okay I will see you in twenty twenty two
ya man
okay
mmhmm
mm
but it's a it's typical what to do that
mmhmm
mm
ah
kan then ah it's like you cover your head but you never cover your bottom
then I was like okay but not all of them are like that what like how right now I have the stigma of a single mother
kan
but
how we react to that it shows
shows ah shows how we are as a person ah so I don't care lah
kan
hmm
be more proper
kan
ya
mmhmm
kan
to certain people it will be like
men are known to have like mental images and they keep
ha
mm
mm
mm
seriously
oh damn you weird
weirdo
I don't know lah whatever lah then
wow
hmm
wow
should we do that like for our
like
gain popularity
for goodness
mmhmm
oh man I can't do that
ya but that's another way for you to tone down your voice what
it's like a beat man
what sia
a'ah
what to expect how to bring yourself
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
kan
kan
is it the time for me to wear
kan
okay lah not really lah
kan
mmhmm
sis is already is big it's not like I am
exactly that's why like you know sometimes and I'm I'm thinking like you know moving forward like what kind of clothes I would want to wear as a hijabi that
with big build or who is plus size or you know like for people who are bigger lah
ya that's why
mm
it's like looking
I don't want to say that word
ringarde
ya
because you are not supposed to stand out you are supposed to
be modest for yourself and for your creator

if that day right I already start uh applying for jobs on this uh
fast job app online then a few of the jobs ah like very interesting
have you ever tried that before
but uh because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
they will see your they will see your feedback and then after that they will uh record and then they will see then they will pay
mm
mm but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
mm
ah
so basically you just have to rate the uh display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
oh my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy paiseh right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come lah it's just that they don't know who only right
oh my god
but imagine ah if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then ah another job I tried right is the
then they call me actually they said the um it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
be to commit long term because I was telling them
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that uh she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company lah but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya lah anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good lah it's three times a week only
mm permanent part time but they need it uh long term
uh shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
is so it's quite convenient what it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
mm
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already mah
uh the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff lah
mm mm
so just anyway just send lah just see how
but some of them ah don't even bother to reply
one six months ah six months to one year you know
and then uh they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose uh the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar eh
the one
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that err also I think it's mondays to
eh it's alternate days eh
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week ah
actually they will give us uh every end of the month for the following month
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
ah rather than your part time job
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit lah and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
the qualification lah I think
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
then my company say cannot because uh according to the rule you cannot do that lah if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
so basically ah you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard uh my ex company
some of the pinoys ah they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
rent
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
so these uh factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra uh I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms eh and then I think there's uh three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people lah
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
day time he's at home he's working remotely lah
and
so he said uh sometimes they dabao then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part lah
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean lah then I'm like eh but you are using the toilet also eh
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent eh
good money right actually
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also lah
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit ah that time he mentioned
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent lah you cannot um anyhow spend
that's why
ya
maybe have lah because um they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and um I think flights also not regular so you have to
they have to go means they have to go lah I guess but then
ya lah like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for or you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the uh advertisement right or the job uh post on link in linkedin
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency lah
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best lor
but then six thousand eh
I didn't know that uh all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K ah I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks ah sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure ah when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo ah is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental ah can
give her like four five K per month eh
because I have friends who married ang moh right so expat ah
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month ah you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already ah
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses lah I mean like um
as male bosses are okay
ya they can demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
err the husband is paying what why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
so what the they did is they always ah book first book a travel first
then got one time ah suddenly the the secretary call me and say eh how come my boss ah the krisflyer point is um
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this uh relocation company
the wife redeem uh free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part ah they didn't even uh say anything to me you know
then after that uh until I ask again ah
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also paiseh ah I said oh ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the uh points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim lor
and never even bother to tell him
ya
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only uh get like fifty percent of the mileage
very flexible one ah that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
I always get like you see lah you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket ah you must tell them this one ah if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
then in the end what happen
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay lah not that much ah
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot lah because this is obviously your mistake
for us ah the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault lah because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright what how can we just you know
but it's actually very scary ah especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
and then the new flight that you take for him
ya
but he's from which airport
it's either ho chin minh or hanoi
so in the end I think you must have booked him on lah because only these two fly direct what
ya
ya lah very scary especially the hotel bit
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
you do this batch I do this batch ah it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date lah so at least eh
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means ah the person that you cock up is your team or
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel lah
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate ah
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already what
you can always book um through
all these third party from the website lah no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes ah hotel themselves even though they give uh they sell their rooms to all these third party
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in what
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course lah right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people ah
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least ah you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one ah family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because uh booking from third party ah I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday uh sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
then how
but hong kong passport don't need visa what
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival lah always uh tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
mm
otherwise you will waste one day
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes ah you just
can you imagine ah if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then ah I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company uh based right
oh
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity ah anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it duh
ya just put out your resume first ah
mm

alright err what were we talking about singapore social right ya

is a very interesting character is one in a million diamond in the rough
should tell her that ah
tell her that
you have any other hot friends
yes I'm very I'm I'm very very I'm for life
or am I
I don't know I'm I'm I'm regretting all my time in right now
no
actually that's really messed up that's really messed up you know the fact right that all
all most of the
toilet recording all the most of the toilet recording incidents right
all happened ah
like you know
is most of them right that make the news ah is all
it's all guy on guy crime that's one
then it's all on the N it's all in you know then err
and this is not the and I mean there's been one or two cases right very very recently that they just brought up
that was just that was just brought up
then err but this wasn't new you know because like say about a year
about a year ago right about a year a year two years ago ah
because I sleep in school
so uh and
my friends they also know they also know this ah
most of the it's
and some more it's in you know how embarrassing
no lah but
no lah but it it it you know it just it just happens right that I'm also schooling in you know shit
no
but then again but but then again but then again
err most of the
err most of the incidents takes err take place in ah
whereas the places where I
patron right err
the toilets where I go to ah they are more like
public access whereas the
hostel ones right they uh most of them
err some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge ah
I'm not too sure about this lah I can't confirm but
there are some right where
err
I think this one also depends on the price of your accommodation ah
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
I really really really needed to take a
so
err
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
so the guy actually err took I still remember you err he had the
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I I entered ah so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
err
you know that like single floor toilet ah
it's just a
it commune toilet ah communal toilet ah that's all only which I can
I can see why right I can see I can probably tell you why lah people
err those pervs right they are more inclined to
to to do this kind of nonsense ah
um there
for you to do that there's only two ways one is you have a
second if you don't have a you need to uh err
you need to involve yourself in hall activities
but
that's lame ah err that's lame lah uh I
a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby
he told me right that that's that used to be the case but it's no longer but currently it's no longer the case already like
uh for them right they're just willing to rent out the accommodation to you ah
that's it only there's no need for you to like
you know and then sweat your punk ass
and then err like or hall activities ah like
yay sixers or whatever
so lame
it's quite it's quite cringey ah it's quite cringey like
there was one there was one time err
err they had like
a orientation week orientation week
it's always the week before the semester starts ah
so they had I swear to you ah it was really cringey
err they had those like err orientation games ah then
they printed out shirts and everything so it was a game of thrones theme
so they uh like what I saw like a bunch of guys in a bunch of guys and girls right they were all
wearing the same thing blue T-shirt then it was like starks and then like
running away from a group of red people in red right who were like gangsters so to me right that's a bit cringey lah
who the hell is running man
who is running man
I have no idea who the hell that is
maybe it's just me lah ah probably it probably is lah just me but
until now I still don't get
err
I don't get the concept of hype beast
I don't understand the concept of hype beast
err last time it used to be
the trend is tight T-shirts is like slim fit tight T-shirts now the trend is
loose or slightly oversized T-shirts so
err
it's weird lah if you ask me
meh
what trumpist
rare commodity okay
oh okay wait hold up hold up you're referring to you're referring to
oh okay lah that's pretty american lah you don't I don't see that the the closest thing I've seen in singapore is um
err I think there was one time I think err can't remember what's her name ah she wore a baseball T-shirt
she wore that was like baseball baseball outfit
to work
no lah but filipino is like that what they that's their that's their sport ah
that that's their sport it's the same as it's the same logic as
I think philippines
philippines they have a they are known to really like
they are known to like basketball
and they are also known for engineering and nursing also that's why
you see ah like when err back in my old workplace ah the one before
the one before

even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
ya
ya
no eh no preference
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
um
bake it
oh
the old chang kee one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the ondeh-ondeh and the red velvet one
ya the ondeh-ondeh one
but it's like
the ondeh-ondeh one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the ondeh-ondeh because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was uh on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
ya
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the briyani with the potato also can
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the bhatoora like in the morning eat very nice ah but also like really oily
I think they like I ya they deep fried or something
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
ah got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like oh maybe can make hummus then we eat with we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying ah so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first uh
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
kunafe is which one
mm I don't think I tried kunafe before but I think I've heard about it before
the is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first uh I think like
ah cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
oh ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at joo chiat right like err that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
huh ang mo kio A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W oh no that one is shake shack
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
ya but I think I like it ah cause
I I was like in the mood for like just not
ya
ya
and uh
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know err during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for you know even their right the each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
so
ya
ya during december then err I also meeting like some of my err like
I want uh we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how lah because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then I cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed ah because like we all thought like err we all planned already and then like that night last minute uh that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her mah but don't know how lah see how
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel oh the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at jurong point anymore I only eat the
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
you guys can eat bingsu or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat lah but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things what
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it seh
if not
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
then
that time also
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people lah but you cannot like err four hundred dollars
ya
I think
err if not you can go bugis like the bugis haji area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to bugis street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's err like it's like affordable uh not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
err ya and then if not you can go to the that time the joo chiat
changi area
around her area
choa chu kang area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite ulu mah so ya
ya
that time I went with her at jurong east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like uh the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad lah but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
I want eat the I don't know I want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but I just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
I think five like I know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five five people
oh ya cannot refund right
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
huh if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go bali
indonesia
I don't think will have
oh I want to go the I want the indian sweet again the pink colour one you know the pink and white one I always eat then I want to buy one of the skirts again
ya but
ya that one that one the mango lassi very nice
oh ya
why suddenly got a lot of face wash ah
oh
I suddenly like I go back home right I like shower and then I was like okay and then shower shower I looked at the face wash area I saw like eh a lot of face wash then all the face wash was like the brand that
two face wash and then one pimple cream and then her perfume and her makeup stuff
ya
ya like I spray like my class nine eight right I spray right until like I spray like on my like on my because I was wearing like inner clothing then I was wearing outer clothing so I spray on the inner clothing on my body also until like
like
and then the lipstick colour also because like very
um like smokey maroon red
it's that type of colour
ya
so
like
I mean like I
I usually the one wearing red lipstick what you always like go for purple or like glosses more then
then it's like okay lah comfortable lah can can

and my name is haziqah
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay ah um just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today ah
ya so two more days before friday woohoo and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
oh so you go back to school all the way
wow we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
ah the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
oh I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause ah number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but eh actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having eh a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's uh I don't think that it is uh economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like oh hello good morning like greet them and then um scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so um ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like oh my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues ah they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
eh I don't know eh I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
wow
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like eh well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example lor then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like aww you got a forty seven oh I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on um students uh to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
um and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to um
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics lah so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like eh you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like oh english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue oh and like
oh and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like oh like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like eh you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
um only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena eh novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than err poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into ah mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching um teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where eh you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly what that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like um india or
at any
any colonised um sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce mmhmm scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that lah that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
uh I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this um having that divide you know uh haiti versus the dominican republic
puerto rican
wow
ya lor so
oh also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in jakarta per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their ah ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world leh even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are um there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around um say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them what at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that lah even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like oh it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like oh say like in primary school you don't have like oh you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then uh
I'm tired
stop yawning
wow okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
kaypoh boy kaypoh
mm
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue duh is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds ah cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with gingy though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
mm
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
oh speaking of that right uh there's this tweet saying that uh what ah
uh the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just uh what do you call it ah
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
eh doesn't make sense oh is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like um south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it

mmhmm
mmhmm
my wish ah
my wish
actually
ya
be a good children
then
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
mm ya
uh ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
uh then we find it
err
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
uh actually we can sell anything lah but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
uh
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
um
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals lah to work there
ya so
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
ya
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
um
mostly is malay food like mee soto mee rebus
nasi lemak
so
mm
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
ya
so uh
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them lah
ya
searching for the suitable space lah first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
err good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mm
because
I
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so it's best either you share everything lah
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
ah
ya
mm
ya
mm
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya

I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish

person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or

you you mean the outpatient

mm
mm
master
oh okay
err is with is with a private coach
yio chu kang
yio chu kang or choa chu kang
ya I think yio chu kang or choa chu kang
mm ya
it's err four lessons
mm
mm four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on lah
mm
err I mean uh two years before two years ago
it's very
meaning I mean very err
uh so I I I I think I need err more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill lah but it will take time
for me
ya
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
is it with the equipment
pilates
ah
mm
is it good
just
err
just uh designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
um the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates lah I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
because private ones I think is quite expensive
mm
mm
I mean the credit
uh
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
um I didn't learn anything from
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
mm
yes
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
mmhmm
ya
one dish
mm
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast lah
I don't mind
but err only the downside is that
err because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
um
I would rather go for something with proteins
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
ya
uh
ya

chicken curry
ya why not and ghee rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy lah
let's say you take err one cup of rice
any cups lah
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take um you can make it with the basmati rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you err if let's say one cup of rice uh you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of ghee
you put the ghee
then you slice like one medium size onion
um but the onion you should you should slice err very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
err translucent like a bit brown then you put
err what is the name in english uh
so just one one will do one small piece of
then
ya that's all lah if you have
then you dah fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
err according to your taste lah
then you cook lah rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version lah there's many kind of
instead of uh instead of
so what's that one and a half cup right
uh
then you put the rice
ah
ya
ya curry chicken lah the best with potatoes
mm
can

your level of merepekness ah things like that
I had tuition is about mummy and abi cannot help us
ah yes
I deserve that first hand items hey
um I don't remember my handle at all
ya those were the days lah
but I would love to go back to those days
less stressful than now
ya
why
last few years you mean
have to live up to the name of the monitress
but you are the monitress you have to be the responsible one oh so instead of monitor monitress other students is like monitress monitor
then why was he the monitor
um oh class voting
going oh oh
the thing
oh where you guys go overseas
oh because she was the same form teacher oh what
malay guy oh ya I think I know her okay oh
polytechnic private
favourite eh I think in terms of memories
I would say secondary
ah less drama more fun
so when it comes to secondary so all this while
oh okay I think for me I remember my primary school because the best year was during primary four
because she is going to cover everything within all her periods and everything and during that time we have young entrepreneur scheme competition
I also imagine like primary one primary two primary three and primary four
everyone was in the same class
uh
and also the lower class lah
antisocial
okay then
ah ah I hold grudge
so it was like primary five primary six secondary one
ah level one meaning
oh
should be something stupid
girls
oh
so was it in hall
ah
except for staff
other side
the real do
oh ya
you have arrived at your destination
ah ah ah
the closest
mafia
spy lah spy four
oh ah okay
so you will like
but did you guys select the correct number of people playing
ah
no it was during year three three point one where we still have a few attorney modules final modules to the end
ya but it's that is like the
other half
all the way till april lah
eh all the way to january eh march all the way to march lah
the most creative guy ever
the average age of students in the class were like what between
poly
we should play hide and seek at the airport you know
okay lah not now lah but
huh
ah going to another classroom
thinking of all the possibilities that it could not be what I thinking it is
ya and then I ask my friend lah which I
and why you describing it to me now I'm starting to imagine okay
um
ah
are you sitting by the window
ah
level eight either mix of guys either mix of girls
so there was this one time

a'ah
a'ah
um
um ya
ya uh um ya so
ya
wait wait wait
err
ya so they will say I wil tell you the number one nine seven two ah fifteen minutes later I I fill the number and tell me again then writing again right ya
ya you know that you are actually
ya do you know that actually are you are supposed to
so it was at the mild stage right you should
gotten it diagnosed then because if you get got it diagnosed then then doctor can frequently follow up but they cannot just do ah the
err what actually dementia you can see from their brain that it is um they having dementia lah but because stroke also can cause you to have some deformities in the brain say dementia is still like a mental condition right they have to do all test there like depression schizophrenia all these they still do test
like verbal assessments you know but
the project
you know they don't
you better but there's no need to stop
we
know
so people
that version
you can got you involved
if means that you need to do
want to
we we talk
we
um
kid
ya I know
you know
mm
I
ya but
you are already tired from work then you go home your parents not to say burden but you have to give hundred percent dedication
um
oh
but sometimes
ya so like if there is something like that I think it's very attractive lah because some is an enclosed space so you can come and visit your
you wanna have a village like that it has to be somewhere that is already developed that still needs more developing like nursing um
ah
ya
the mmhmm
there are because like if they know then some people might take advantage of it
ya
ya
ya
I think
but if you have um your rental flat that is above it right that studio apartment that is above you have two hundred to four hundred unit eh two hundred unit so two hundred units
but because her dad like everybody has err I mean maybe not just singapore everybody
temple is a hindu temple
you know but how about the buddhist how about the carton how about the christians how about any
ya lah
mm ya
I think
mm ya mm
mm
mm
I'm not
that kind of thing then um then like then
a'ah
ya so like or don't no and then I feel maybe
mm
oo
I think there are a few points that be
take away from here is the number one
because
ah
mm
but
but it's just me like I because I don't like to travel so you are convenient lah that I'm already at my house like that
ya so
mm
mm
mmhmm
you think you have
um next ah what
I think
so far from what I learned about this are taking care of a being a secondary caregiver or living in the same household right
a'ah
what I think
ya like
that's the main thing that's the main thing ya like you have to always be prepared like because the thing is for progressive condition right
then you move on on on you
so you like you're drowning you
I try to swim okay let me ah see how I if I can go and get help it really is that they're getting help
ah swimming is trying to move forward right is really paying like you really can't and sometimes when you want
mm
it's like um
you know why I believe that it is not working I would like to close the case I would like to go somewhere else then you you have to be let alright I will close the case and then
what for the um for the
professional sometimes if they feel like the case is not is not going smoothly it's not working out they can actually feedback to their supervisor and be like I'm sorry but I think this case any if not working out you know
you already have that bond and the attachment
and for professionals that is that boundary
ya
mm
mm mm
ya
ya you guys are doing experimenting on your own you know like that's what doctors want it's because doctors are not there twenty four seven
sometimes doctors are also like unhappy lah like you want you keep the medication here medication there but it's just that dementia is so different that dementia is not
ah
mm
mm so we know lah that communication is like the key to
mm
mm
mm
mm
phenomenon
oh okay lah
okay

stalisha
my day today is very tiring obviously um it's been two days ah I sleep very late
um and so far it's been well um it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring lah
um it's among the home-based sellers lah
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
have their
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
ah ah
customers ah
yes
delivery is
um by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya ah so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight lah hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
um
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
ah I have school I have um freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
ya
go ah because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change lah because I like to bake also
um brownies or cookies something like that
branding
tahbegs tahbegs
ya it's tahbegs is from tahu and begedil but we make it very hipster
so it's tahbegs
ya T H B E G S
oh ya um I also own a small business selling bawals
eh it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be eh next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
um better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
ah because um me and my partner lah
ya we we
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
twenty one
that young
oh
ah
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
that's the best you can sleep
oh okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
oh mm ah
mm mm
wow okay
uh uh
mm mm
I you like wrapped
oh okay okay okay
uh uh
uh uh
oh my god
they didn't pay you
oh ya ya ya
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh I see
um
what am I doing at nineteen
um I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
um
there was this
and then um I was very camera shy last time
so I'm like meh like I I don't even bother lah but then my partner saw like eh you should try lah you just try then orh
I said no I don't want err I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the um the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
ah he applied to two ah company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
ah it was an unpaid job
for
um until I was maybe
um nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
um
by their apparel
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like um the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
err when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
tell me lah like oh you need to start
um charging these people because you are having a lot of um
and alhamdulillah it also went well
ah
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
um sell their products ah
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
uh and it didn't work ah
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because ah her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales lah so I was like okay um actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they um they really spread the word and tag you know
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
other companies ya
mmhmm
usually um before we post something right for the company we also like send the
what do they call it
okay lah the context ah the context of the post ah we
ya the description we always like um send it
ah on our post
uh it's our post because we are like um ya
usually is like that
ah no that that's the thing that's why I don't um I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like um they told me lah like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
um is very difficult
um and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle lah but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school um there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson um end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night lah something like that
ya it's like it's very bad lah is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up uh my own company ah
um
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
alamak we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
mm
because all of this um of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
um creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well lah and
uh uh
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
their customers like
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face lah when I'm opening this um Kamash
um
yes
and
out first what ah ah
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
eight colours already sold out
ya
ah we manufacture ourself
ah no uh we liaise with a factory in jakarta
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
mm
no lah I mean like obviously uh when you grow up
eh
ah my god okay it needs to switch
naturally um
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
cons about being a nurse
and then ah
some personal reasons lah for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
those type of
incident
car crash eh plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee what
and
ya lah exactly then I was like okay sure
so ah basically ah
so I'm like okay lah since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
um ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor orh an acting
orh okay ah clown doctor
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
oh okay
uh
I can fix my own teeth
mm
mm
wow
ya
oh my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
mmhmm
mm
mm I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
eh the first ya your first show is it
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like wah
well quite nice lor
so
ya
but it was good though
mm
oh I see
oh
mmhmm
ya
mm
ya correct
mm
ya that's that's the thing
um usually people are afraid to set a price
um
we calculate our expenses ah and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see lah um like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like oh we can sell it from this price to this price no uh no lower than that
if it's lower than that um means
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
mm mm
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not chai I don't like chai
oh really
oh I see
ah ah
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
oh my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
oh okay you thinking far
yes
uh huh
oh okay okay okay
I don't know ah I feel like
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
oh ya
why would you need okay those like big things like tables fridge um washing machine
wow such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in what and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
and then like I was training at
and then
ya ya on purpose I don't know I have no idea
so I was like ya because there's um
so ya
um how to say ah
they hold their respect lah towards their opponent
like are ready to like ah I want to challenge you are you agree or not do you agree or not ya
a lot of things
it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman
ya
um
but
ya
so you literally need to fly
you need to like jump and like

mm
hmm
ya
mm
ya correct
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh like to ask if you think like it's rude
is it
ya
I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
but to them I say oh okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
so something like that
what if what
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know eh

if you are we are not working at anymore we don't have to work you don't have to work what would you do

so fathul I have a question for you mm if you have three wishes what are err what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would err void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say um by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things hmm maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and after all to live happily is what everyone wants lah
mm and some skills that I want to have err maybe include err having all the capabilities to all the knowledge that that exist in this world ah
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily err to us to some people to live happily is to have err the money and the wealth
err so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy ah and intelligence also ah this is to me I think it relates to me also ah because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
uh so maybe for now we move uh to the next question which is err superpowers fathul what err if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
ah eh
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of ah the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you err by accident
the the
the amount of err infection or the possibilities of uh infection rate ah you have anything to argue
yes correct
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk uh ambitions that I have
or maybe uh I I can take risks without having worrying that I might uh injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe err get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win ah
provided I am strong ah and maybe with this regeneration
hmm
I can donate let's say some parts of my uh limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
hmm where I have this ability so I can do is err I request my leg to be cut off and then give away err in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard uh tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
mm what do you think about this regeneration ability
mm it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having uh to be looked at or without err being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
hmm I have this
I want to be uh isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self ah to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems uh affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
mm
how long maybe until I feel peace ah so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I I cannot give a number of years or months ah but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months ah then slowly maybe I will
err increase the number of the period ah slowly
hmm
we can never do something to improve the people around us
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable lah
but it has to be looked in a certain way ah whereby the person
err
he is not affecting badly uh around the people uh uh he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state ah
uh
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
they will change a lot lah so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small err goals small err
small achievement so this child will live without uh having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife ah he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife err agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free ah to do anything that he wants
do you think so
eh
uh cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
err
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary ah but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams ah
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart ah
mm so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self err I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self ah
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
mm and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
um what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos uh I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and uh an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud lah or maybe just email yourself ah so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
err a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself uh since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is err I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see err how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe err start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
mm
K
you maybe you next we should talk about um near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was err I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was uh stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall uh is when I was
err riding bike uh it happens maybe due to
err rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to uh overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next uh topic that I have in mind which is err a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
uh ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
hmm whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that err there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
um synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example uh few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
err I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future um a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go uh deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took uh I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
so you have anything to add on

happy new year sis
it's okay life has to move on the then what is your resolution for twenty twenty one
mm
but what I mean it it is achievable lah for a year achievable
so for this year because last year is it is a transition for me from a student to a working adult and it's very hard situation actually and I don't think the ya

then when it comes to twenty twenty I started to work
it comes with costs lah which is I don't have time for myself anymore and ya I I went to work at eight then
err more me time
ah I want I want to in a easy way to explain this I want to upgrade myself
that's that's my own definition of me time ah
yes like personal skills that is not is not related to my work at all
ya this is something that I really want from
from like twenty years back when I was young
I don't have money and I don't have the effort to actually to pursue that ah
I want to enroll in piano class
