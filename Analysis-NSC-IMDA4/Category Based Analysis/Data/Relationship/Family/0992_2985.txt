okay
[a'ah] so <malay>kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap</malay> like in both like <malay>melayu dengan</malay> english so <malay>boleh tak</malay>
so
okay maybe <malay>kita nak cakap pasal</malay> like <malay>kita punya</malay> favourite show <malay>boleh tak</malay>
ya I think movie also can so should be okay
[oh] movie <malay>apa</malay>

why it is sad like
wait like <malay>buta</malay> like like how <malay>buta hati atau</malay> like you know
like [ah] okay
[oh]
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like <malay>kenapa dia buta</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh</malay> then after that
[ah]
wait <malay>tapi</malay> the guy know <malay>yang</malay> like like
the guy is <malay>dia apa tu yang punca yang</malay> the girl <malay>punya</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[ah] [oh]
!wah!
but then how [ah] like
<malay>lelaki tu</malay> !wah!
ya
why so weird
<malay>memang macam</malay> like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya [lah] but like <malay>macam</malay> it's so coincidental you know like <malay>macam</malay> the girl <malay>dengan</malay> the guy is like
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
[oh]
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>kedai</malay> ya
what
but <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think <malay>kena tengok</malay> right
but that's really your favourite movie
your <malay>abang</malay> is my <malay>adik</malay>
!wah!
(err)
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show [oh] then [ah] my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
I think it's kind of <malay>takde lagi</malay> is it
<malay>pasal dia</malay> ya <malay>dia orang dah</malay> remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like <malay>perempuan</malay> you know like the girls and then like [eh] like <malay>macam</malay> like when I watch it I was like [oh] my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know (uh) <malay>macam baca buku</malay> all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like
(um) they suddenly
(um)
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he I think <malay>dia orang ada</malay> like <malay>sepuluh</malay> seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that <malay>lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> like <malay>tiga puluh lebih</malay> and until like
all of them I think almost all of them get married
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you <malay>tengok</malay> like <malay>macam dia orang</malay> like grow to become like a better person
so <malay>macam</malay> damn cool because I also because like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam banyak orang ingatkan</malay> like <malay>orang yang suka</malay> science <malay>semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil</malay> like very awkward right like they feel like they <malay>macam</malay> cannot fit into the society
ya
socially less awkward and also because like <malay>macam</malay> if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
[kan] like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
because like I remember one episode [kan] like <malay>macam</malay> young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy <malay>nama</malay> sheldon
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young [lah] so the thing is like he's (err) like professor in this like
school like not really a professor [lah] by research scientists and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like (um) <malay>banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh</malay> fit in
but then over the years <malay>apa dia dia dia cuba</malay> like fit in to like parties <malay>macam</malay> because <malay>ada seorang perempuan</malay> popular <malay>ni</malay> neighbour <malay>dia</malay>
[kan] and then like (um) <malay>dia</malay> like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they will they will feeling very awkward because <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> like <malay>cuba</malay> to interact with like the rest
ya <malay>dia orang semua ingatkan dia</malay> weird <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>dia datang pun</malay> like <malay>dengan baju tak senonoh</malay>
until the party and cannot fit in [lah] but then <malay>lepas tu</malay> then he realise that [oh] my god
like (um) over the years [kan] they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like [ah] people who are like basically like
<malay>apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok</malay> show <malay>ni daripada kecil</malay> call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing [lah] because like <malay>dia dia dia pun</malay> like was single all the way then <malay>lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan</malay> [ah] <malay>kahwin</malay> then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then <malay>tak</malay> he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> to like
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met [ah] through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise <malay>betul tak</malay> like he cannot like
(um) you know like straightaway
like realise [eh] tomorrow you gonna get married this person
ya so they actually show us <malay>yang macam</malay> love
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
<malay>terus</malay> jump to it
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> carry <malay>macam</malay> opposite of each other
ya so <malay>dia orang</malay> cuddle cuddle <malay>dia macam</malay> like [eh] let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy <malay>macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu</malay> then like
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world [lor]
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing [lah] that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool [kan] I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker [lah] don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
[oh] because you <malay>pakai</malay> like all the <malay>duit</malay> birthday for all this
[oh]
[oh] ya you told me [what]
[oh] ya ya the cafe thing then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
I know you said you show me the photos [mah] and then <malay>macam</malay> it's damn nice [what]
[oh]
!wah!
#oma# spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
no [lah] but waffle [kan] <malay>macam murah takkan</malay> they will charge you [lah]
okay but #haji# lane is overpriced <malay>sebab tu</malay> [lah] you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually <malay>murah</malay> ya but it's at where somerset
farrer park ya but the thing is
that means like <malay>macam kalau</malay> they are not like at the central area of singapore [kan] it's usually cheaper
very circular
ya [lah] that's why it's cheaper [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if it if it's at town right confirm <malay>mahal</malay>
actually ya
(uh huh)
what no [lah] but <malay>tu untuk buka</malay> like cafe in singapore quite
like tough [what]
so you become like <malay>ibu</malay>
but you know
design the place itself [kan] <malay>macam</malay> they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
ya but it's not
it's not it's very <malay>mahal</malay> and like ya
it's like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we we it's like our like previous <malay>kedai</malay> [lor]
ya it's like you need to know <malay>makanan apa sedap</malay> and then like sometimes [kan] you hire the chef and the <malay>dia tak tahu masak</malay>
ya
no but actually <malay>makanan tak sedap pun tak apa</malay> [tau] cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like <malay>macam</malay> it's cool [lah] like
you know like your <malay>makanan</malay> K cause your <malay>makanan tak sedap</malay> [kan] at least your coffee <malay>sedap</malay> or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
[eh]
ya
maybe you are just like picky
ya ya [lah] you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee <malay>macam tak ada gula</malay>
ya like <malay>takde gula</malay> is like totally fine with me ya
tea without sugar can but coffee [oh] because of the bitterness [kan]
it's just weird
K [lah] okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
actually I want to ask you [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts (um) if you have like <malay>tiga</malay> like wish that you wanna wanna
you can fulfil [lah] okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
ya like okay like <malay>kalau tak ada macam</malay> K if like there's no boundaries because you know like <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so (um) out of these three [kan] like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay [lah] have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
#lee kuan yew# no [ah] is it you can be rich I can't remember
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like [oh] I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like [kan] like <malay>duit apa tu apa tu</malay> it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar [kan] <malay>tak</malay> fun
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know [what]
what
okay I think that's a bit far [oh]
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
cause like I feel like I'm <malay>macam sangat</malay> lost
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
(mmhmm)
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
there's too many like <malay>macam</malay> like direction that you can go like because you imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you stay in malaysia then like ya <malay>tak banyak</malay> ya like I think you will only get like
like [kan] <malay>siapa</malay> like most people will go either retail and then like or office world [lah] because in singapore we <malay>kita kita</malay> believe in like equality right
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries [lah] our neighbouring countries [lah]
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries [lah] if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore [ah] no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
so that's why I like I like the so for me <malay>macam</malay> like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working [kan] like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
like you know
even though I know it pays well like <malay>gaji besar</malay> but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's <malay>penat</malay> and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun [kan]
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay [lah] maybe you <malay>kalau</malay> you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start <malay>macam betul susah</malay>
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case [lah]
ya <malay>bukan</malay> like the
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot [lah] hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national railway railway is [eh] you know the train [one]
[oh] my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay [lah] (um)
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
ya cause you know like if you go #jakarta# like I don't know you wait did go #batam# ya you went #batam# before right and you know like <malay>macam</malay> some places are very crowded then you know they don't care [one] ya
no but maybe maybe because like
they do though because that time I went national gallery then <malay>dia orang semua duduk dekat</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang semua</malay> loiter <malay>dekat</malay> you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then <malay>kena pekik</malay> [sia] they were like !oi! is you new like why
what you doing there !huh! (uh) you never read the sign is it
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend [lah] then I was like [oh] my god what's this maid doing [ah]
[eh] ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like [oh] my god
like [ah] like the maid was shocked [lah] when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya I <malay>tak kisah</malay> so I just like walk away and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
ya because it's okay [lah] but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
<malay>tapi</malay> like
(um) you need to
like you can achieve now [lah] I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy [lah] to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
you are just lucky cause like in singapore <malay>macam</malay> even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
!huh!
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and (uh) cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia [ah] and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya [lah] but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave account
post secondary [ah]
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya so we all ya I think singapore <malay>bagi kita</malay> like money to like spend for all these trips [sia] so I think it's like I think that's a good thing [eh]
ya
so can use that
(err) if it there's one country my wish list [lah]
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young [lah] I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like #naruto# like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing [lah] last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly #naruto# come in ya [ah] pokemon all this you know and then I was like
[oh] my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
!wah!
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
<malay>dia</malay> sounds like internship [kan] then I was like !wah!
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like #osaka# #kyoto# #tokyo#
and I when #nara# I went like #kanazawa# then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no [lah] I went with my friend but I went (um) I think I went #hiroshima# alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter [eh] wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing [lor]
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like #tokyo# and #osaka# they rarely snow I think
#tokyo# ya #tokyo# rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
[oh] you didn't know I went korea [oh] my god
I showed you ya
[oh] my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only [ah] it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have [ah] thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no [lah] I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
#wei# you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
ya <malay>macam</malay> like people from korea guam that's why
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition [mah]
ya
no [lah] (um) I think K because
<malay>macam</malay> like <malay>banyak orang</malay> that like
most of them [lah] actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so (uh) it's their first language [lah] english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
(um) you know the #seoul# tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya #wei# you didn't know I went all these !wah! it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also [lah] that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper [what]
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in #temasek# my microsoft
korea bought my bags [mah]
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business <malay>macam</malay> it's easy to
okay [lah] it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like <malay>macam</malay> I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
ya
[oh] you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
!huh!
you should go with <malay>afal adik</malay>
I feel like going with your friend [kan]
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went #batam# with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like [oh] no I cannot eat it's [oh] no like this place is
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know <malay>macam tempat</malay>
<malay>tak bersih sangat</malay> [lah] also it's okay ya ya they don't care [one]

[oh] ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage [lah]
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment (err) one star price then I was like
!alamak! why you like that

so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya I know
I know
ya
interesting [lah]
like ya
but I think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other [kan]
ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
like <malay>selamat datang ke</malay> podcast <malay>saya</malay>
ya but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> like podcast [kan] <malay>ada</malay>
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between [kan] ya
(mmhmm)
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a #suria# actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
(mmhmm)
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no [lah] like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why <malay>bapa</malay> all listening to podcast now
ya
ya I didn't expect
him
except for me
I never use
ya
the only time I actually use that day was to watch
no ya big bang and then after that I was like [oh] my god I found a website like no no not not no (err) because like I my friend bought the whole
I think ya the whole box then my friend give me lend me [lah] then I watch everything finish then I stopped watching already because the only reason why I watch Netflix is because of that
ya unless I won't use it so actually I wanted to subscribe I tell you [ah] like I just want to try so I actually could just use the one month free or was it three months but then in the end never [lah] then you guys all use free I never rely on anyone [lah] ya I very independent
you know I have always been independent not like you guys isn't it true
!huh!

doing your room how
but my room nice [ah]

no but even if it's not alone also because I'm an I'm a neat freak
like even if like it's it's like I I live with my army friends I will make sure like everything is in order unless I have to do work no I'm not a perfectionist [lah] unless work right you see so for me right I have like a space where I can be very messy
but then I will clean it up at the end of the night
ya
