okay <malay>abang</malay> so how our renovation plans
<malay>hari raya</malay> !wah! you so confident now is still COVID do you think can celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay> yet
it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
like our siblings four ya I think around there so maybe direct families only can celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay>
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot [ah] too risky
okay
why are we talking about <malay>hari raya</malay>
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
(uh) how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but (uh)
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
so <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> (um)
<malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> Popular I <malay>beli</malay> cardboard
I <malay>beli kertas yang keras tu</malay> then (uh) I
<malay>cari gambar nanti</malay> I print
<malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>cetak</malay> <malay>nanti</malay> I print <malay>lepas tu nanti boleh tampal</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> cardboard <malay>itu</malay>

<malay>apa</malay> designer <malay>itu nanti baru dia bilang baru kita boleh tanya sekarang pun kita kita</malay> just (um)
<malay>kita</malay> just <malay>baca-baca</malay> [jer] <malay>tak tahu betul ke tak ke</malay> [kan]
<malay>buat lawak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak ada maksudnya</malay>
<malay>kita kita pun tak tahu apa yang</malay> company (err) company <malay>itu nak apa nak</malay>
<malay>tunjuk kita nak bagi kita</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>jadi kita</malay> just
<malay>kita ambil ambil gambar inspirasi</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>letak kat dalam</malay> mood board <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>hari itu</malay> I <malay>dah tunjuk</malay> you <malay>gambar dekat</malay> WhatsApp <malay>dah tengok belum</malay>
WhatsApp
[ha] ya [lah] <malay>habis</malay> group <malay>mana</malay>
<malay>dah tengok</malay>
<malay>corak</malay> [oh] okay [ah] if it's the kitchen then I like the open concept
you know like the english one the not contemporary [ah] english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
<malay>betul juga</malay> (uh) (uh) [eh] <malay>paling tidak nanti kita masak nanti habis semua</malay> (uh) <malay>apa itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>almari perabot semua berminyak yang hari itu ingat tak yang kita panggil apa itu</malay>
<malay>orang yang</malay> (uh) <malay>cucikan</malay> sofa
<malay>sekali dia cakap dia punya minyak yang melekat itu apa yang kotoran yang melekat itu</malay> actually <malay>dari daripada minyak masak</malay>
(uh) (uh) [lah] okay [lah] then I I have to agree with you [lah] we go we put the partition that means
[eh] ya [lah] correct [lah] when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like (um)
[ah] like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
!chey! private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt [lah] all that [lah] so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny [ah]
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like (uh)
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
(mm)
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
(uh) mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
(uh) or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
<malay>lepas itu</malay> (uh) <malay>yang bahagian luar itu yang dekat</malay> (uh) platform <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>yang yang dulu</malay> actually <malay>nak buat</malay> #musollah# <malay>lepas itu tak jadi</malay>
<malay>sebenarnya bukan nak</malay> hack <malay>nak nak buang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang lama punya</malay> platform <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> platform <malay>itu satu dah bunyi dua dah reput</malay>
<malay>tiga kayu pun dah nak dah nak terkopek dah dah nak reput</malay> [lah] <malay>itu dah nak</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya hujung itu dah terkopek jadi macam ada lubang</malay>
<malay>lepas itu bawah</malay> platform <malay>itu pun kita tak tahu jadi sarang binatang apa mungkin sarang cicak</malay>
<malay>mungkin sarang labah-labah sarang semut tapi sarang semut tu makanan</malay>
(mm)
[eh] but the other day I went through (um) this hard zone or something [lah] the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across (uh) this person
(uh) he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else [lah] then it's already two K
just the platform
(uh huh) <malay>buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak</malay> vinyl <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas itu nanti dah ada</malay>
<malay>letak</malay> vinyl <malay>dan kalau ada</malay> budget then <malay>baru boleh tambah</malay> platform
(mm)
okay <malay>tak apa itu nanti</malay>
I put (uh) under
(uh) extra budget column
in the planning [lah] so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then [ah] the service balcony you know the
the doorway (um) between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills (uh) window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it [what] so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay [ah]
that [one] I that [one] that idea came from <malay>tak</malay> I <malay>nampak hari itu</malay> my friend <malay>dia tengah buat</malay> renovation <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>lepas itu dia</malay> upload <malay>dekat</malay> (uh) story
<malay>lepas itu dia pakai</malay> glass <malay>itu</malay> [ah] (um) <malay>dia pun ada</malay> that same same <malay>sama punya segi</malay> balcony <malay>lepas itu dia</malay>
<malay>pakai sama apa itu</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia dia yang dia yang</malay> I <malay>nampak daripada</malay> story <malay>dia</malay> [lah] <malay>yang dia pakai</malay> glass <malay>itu kalau tidak</malay> I <malay>pun jadi tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> replace that that <malay>tingkap dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan apa</malay> so idea <malay>dia datang itu</malay> [lah] I <malay>ternampak</malay> story my friend
<malay>dia ada</malay> tag <malay>hari itu tapi</malay> I <malay>tak ingat ada dia ada</malay> tag (uh)
<malay>dia dia</malay> popular <malay>juga apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nama dia</malay> [eh] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>habis sekarang</malay> I scolding [ah] everytime they upload video
[ah] <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>pergi intai dia punya</malay> video <malay>tengok apa</malay> progress <malay>cari</malay> idea
(mm)
actually not bad [leh] you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that (uh) different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
!wah! I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
(uh) came to real life you know really [eh] so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like (uh) extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this [one] is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
[ah]
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else [oh] ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
(err) like the window grill I don't know
so but then that [one] I haven't research (uh)
<malay>abang</malay> you <malay>boleh tolong tengok-tengokkan tak apa jenis tingkap yang ada</malay> you <malay>tolong</malay> scolding [kan] <malay>ke kat jiran-jiran daripada bawah</malay> I
I [kan] <malay>tadi nampak juga ada satu itu dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>tingkap cantik</malay>
<malay>dia satu yang dia pakai yang</malay> (uh) <malay>sorot punya yang lagi satu yang buka punya</malay> (uh) <malay>yang macam ketat</malay>
(uh) <malay>ketat punya macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>yang ada yang ada</malay> handle [eh]
[ah] <malay>tapi cantik dia macam</malay> simple <malay>saja tapi cantik</malay>
<malay>tapi masalahnya sekarang</malay> sliding <malay>pun binatang masuk mungkin dah haus agaknya dah bertahun</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tingkap</malay> okay actually <malay>dia orang cakap kalau boleh cari</malay> supplier <malay>sendiri pun bagus tapi sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>ini tingkap lagi nak buat satu rumah</malay> already <malay>yang</malay> [kan] <malay>sudah</malay>
but (uh) ya
I think I think it's because [ah] it's already old [lah] that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not [what] it's supposed to be tight [what] like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the (uh) the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this [one] capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical (uh) wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya [lah] that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
<malay>dulu bunyi dia tak macam itu kuat</malay> [tau] <malay>dulu bunyi dia perlahan sahaja</malay> I <malay>bila kat dapur baru bunyi</malay>
<malay>sekarang daripada bilik hujung dah boleh dengar maknanya apa maknanya dia dah besar dah dah sedap makan dah sempat membesar</malay> you <malay>tak bunuh dia sebab itu</malay> I <malay>cakap kena panggil</malay>
<malay>orang itu yang tangkap tangkap cicak itu</malay>
<malay>ini sesi mengadu nasib ke</malay>
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
time for a renovation already cannot make cannot [lah] I cannot <malay>tahan</malay> already is
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia [lah] because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
(uh) recipients
[eh] but [eh] but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back !yay! belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house [ah] you watch the host [ah] hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
[eh] but the new season (uh) the other day I was (uh) randomly (uh) looking for right
and then I saw (uh) one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
(um) the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was [ah] what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this [one] this time round is this company !aiya! I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually (uh) watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this [ah] if not actually (uh) three D innovation is good [leh]
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
(uh) what do you call that low income families [eh]
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them [ah] because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget [lah] maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what [ah] you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper [lah] okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back (uh)
[oh] we didn't even say anything but he himself say that (uh) we we call
him a a liar but we didn't even say that you know suddenly and then he just went off out of the gate like <malay>merajuk</malay>
you <malay>tahu macam merajuk perempuan</malay> [ah] okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>saya tipu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya tipu</malay> [lah] okay [lah] bye bye
emotional [ah] uncle <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tak boleh lupa</malay> [eh] <malay>kelakar</malay>
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years [eh] the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the (uh) what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that [one]
okay whatever you call it [ah] ya that [one] also some already (uh) like (uh) <malay>apa itu</malay>
(uh) wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman [seh] to install our this [one] the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only [lah] that [one] okay [lah] but even so (uh) remember the
the also not proper
hollow [eh]
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask [what] we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
(uh) and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to #hafari# right
he ask us to go and see the tile but actually he already got a tile in his hand he already know what he want to do for us already <malay>merepek</malay> right
then [ah] then after that (mm)
either that or he know that he never do correctly [lah] he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable [what] right because ya it's a expensive tile
maybe [lah] he want to save that way or what !alamak! then I regret [seh] <malay>sekarang menyesal</malay> [seh] <malay>tak pakai</malay> tiles <malay>yang kita pilih</malay>
<malay>dah bersusah payah kita pergi</malay> #hafari# <malay>lepas itu pilih yang kita nak lepas itu dia suka-suka hati pula habis kita pun tak tahu datang kita pergi</malay> ya [kan] <malay>saja</malay>
(mm)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia cakap tak tak jadi jadi tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tak licin tak jatuh</malay>
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope [lah] we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet (uh) already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
ya they just give us rough idea there's no three D or whatever <malay>pun</malay> so
they give us a quote at least we know (uh) like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the (uh) is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
<malay>habis</malay> (uh) <malay>nak kena</malay> plan <malay>nak kena</malay>
plan <malay>itu lagi</malay> budget <malay>lagi nak kena</malay> plan budget <malay>nanti</malay> you <malay>bilang</malay> I <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>buatkan</malay> breakdown
[kan] so <malay>kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa</malay> [kan] toilet <malay>pun kita baru buat cuma</malay> maybe <malay>kalau</malay> tiles <malay>itu memang</malay>
<malay>tak bagus itu tukar saja</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> slope <malay>pun ingat tak kita</malay> [kan] <malay>suruh dia buat</malay> slope <malay>jadi air pun mengalir betul pergi kat longkang itu tapi</malay>
<malay>pun masih bertakung</malay> [tau] I <malay>cuci</malay> toilet <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>tahu masih bertakung macam tak betul dia punya</malay> slope <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>tapi yang macam</malay> accessories <malay>macam tempat mandi</malay> (uh) <malay>apa itu picit-picit nak cebok</malay> [ah] <malay>tu semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>boleh pakai balik</malay> [ah] so at least <malay>itu dah</malay> save cost <malay>sebab itu pun</malay> under <malay>dalam</malay> quotation <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu dah</malay> save cost [lah] <malay>lagi perabot pun kalau kat rumah</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>ada</malay> budget <malay>untuk buat yang rumah punya pun</malay> actually <malay>perabot tak payah cuma kita</malay> just <malay>ambil gambar</malay> [ah] <malay>kita tunjukkan gambar dia perabot-perabot yang kita ada</malay>
<malay>tengok tema apa yang sesuai dengan perabot kita sebab perabot kita pun</malay> considered
(uh) <malay>apa itu macam</malay> modern <malay>apa</malay> modern minimalist <malay>pun boleh sebab warna kelabu macam itu</malay> [kan] <malay>senang sikit</malay> [lah]
(mm) modern <malay>juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak</malay> (mm)
<malay>lagi apa</malay>
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kita dah tukar</malay> [eh]
so far <malay>yang kat dalam</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> ya [lah] [kan] <malay>lampu</malay> (uh) ya so hopefully
hopefully that [one] will reduce the cost [ah] cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist (uh) off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have [ah] that [one] already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
(mm) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay> plan <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>ini tak</malay> standard plan is one (uh) kitchen two toilet
[ah]
[ah] package ya two standard
<malay>sebab itu kalau</malay> you <malay>nak buat</malay> kitchen <malay>saja ini susah memang dia</malay> comes together so might as well <malay>buat saja</malay>
<malay>sebab kalau kita sikit-sikit</malay> you <malay>tengok sikit-sikit kita buat tiga</malay> K <malay>habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit</malay> then end up <malay>kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya</malay> [kan]
so <malay>kita betul-betul buat sekaligus</malay> [lah] <malay>lagi pun</malay> toilet
<malay>lagi pun</malay> (uh) <malay>bilik air dengan dapur dah sebelah-sebelah</malay> [kan] <malay>habis kita nak rombak itu lagi kita nak pecahkan tembok itu</malay> [ah]
[eh] <malay>sekali terus habuk semua</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>lagi bilik bilik</malay> #aqi# <malay>pun</malay>
(mm) <malay>bilik</malay> #aqi# <malay>pun dia punya lantai pun dah kopak itu kalau nak pasang</malay> vinyl vinyl <malay>sahaja</malay>
<malay>dah berapa</malay> (uh) that time eight hundred [kan] <malay>lapan ratus</malay> vinyl <malay>sahaja dah lapan ratus habis ini</malay>
[oh] double
[ah]
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if (uh) whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same (uh) the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need (uh)
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own (uh) contractor for the vinyl right
[ah] when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
[ah]
<malay>kita kena buka balik sebab nak kena pecahkan balik dekat pintu</malay> toilet <malay>itu semua nak kena</malay>
(mm) <malay>kalau kita buat balik</malay> [lah]
<malay>itu</malay> [kan] <malay>pintu</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> [kan] <malay>dah reput bawah dia itu yang itu nak kena</malay> <malay>nak kena</malay>
hack <malay>nak kena</malay> plaster <malay>balik</malay>
<malay>semua akan</malay> affected
<malay>tapi ini</malay> click function [kan] vinyl <malay>itu</malay> remember
ya it is the newest click function that [one] right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own [one] but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>ini ini kena potong kena apa kena</malay> measure <malay>sembarang saja</malay>
<malay>entah nanti tak tersempurna lagi</malay> [ha]
[ha]
<malay>entah tengok itu cacat</malay>
<malay>tak boleh dah haus</malay> you <malay>tengok dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya tengok ini dah</malay> <malay>hitam hitam itu maknanya dia dah ada</malay> gap [lah] <malay>dia dah ada jarang-jarang</malay> in between <malay>dia punya ini kayu</malay>
[ah]
then how how because vinyl <malay>pun boleh kembang ikut</malay> (uh) <malay>panas atau sejuk</malay> [tau] <malay>bilik</malay>
[ah] <malay>dalam bertahun</malay> [ah] <malay>ini ini pun macam tak tukar</malay> [ha] <malay>ini dah kembang</malay> [lah] <malay>ini nampak</malay> line <malay>dia ada</malay> gap
<malay>lepas itu tak boleh ada</malay> gap <malay>itu</malay> hit <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dah ini merekah</malay> [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in (uh) kids room
[oh]
ya
(uh) (uh) [eh] <malay>ini tak bagus ini</malay> I think <malay>murah punya ini bukan yang</malay> vinyl [tau] <malay>ini yang</malay>
<malay>murah punya sebab itu dia kena air dah menggelembung</malay>
[eh] (mm)
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company (uh) he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give [what] remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
(mm)
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that [one] cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know (uh) overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that [one] also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is (uh) I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean [eh] you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
(hmm)
vinyl
(mm)
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this [one] remember this [one] got two option we this [one] is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move [one] without lesser groove
ya
maybe that [one] cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser [ah] grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
(mm)
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop (uh) water sucking mop [what]
that [one] that [one] you won't go into the groove
ya [lah] it suck water the mop suck water right
[ah]
okay water absorbing mop
[oh]
[oh] that [one]
that [one] very expensive that [one] is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but [ah] make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous [eh] that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
<malay>dia orang pandai</malay> [kan] [eh]
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old (uh) [oh] now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M [one] but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
!huh! difficult have [what]
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home [one] you go and find no
only that brush [sial] no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
[ah]
okay so (uh) actually [oh] I forgot to tell you I (uh) I sign up through Renopedia
and then (um) through there there will be contacting me [ah] like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even (uh) ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection [lah] so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us [lah] through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia [what] right
so is all go back to our own research [ah]
actually they say (um) doesn't mean the very the company [eh] very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the (uh) company but I must also research (uh) and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
[ah] hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then (uh) also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then (err)
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go (uh) down and (uh) have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give [lah]
ya (uh) but I haven't show you then I I even I even (uh) wrote down their names the
(uh)
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
[oh] ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down [what]
(mm)
it must be a balance [ah] we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
[ah] to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house
