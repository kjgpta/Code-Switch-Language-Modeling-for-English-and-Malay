<malay>nanti kat atas</malay> it's a dragon <malay>tapi</malay> usually <malay>dia orang tak ada duit nak habiskan</malay> the dragon so it's just a koi fish at the forearm
seriously I
I kena like <malay>tiga orang</malay> who have the exact same tattoo and they stop at the exact same spot

hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
cause the gun is going in and out it's very fast so you <malay>tak rasa sangat</malay>
or like you <malay>rasa</malay> for a shorter amount of time cause it's <malay>masuk keluar masuk keluar</malay>
well with the hand [one] it's like the person <malay>cucuk</malay> one by one slowly I'm sure it's gonna hurt more
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast [lah]

[ah]
[ah] okay
[oh] [dah] <malay>buat salah sekarang buat baik pula</malay>

[oh]
<malay>baik hati</malay> [ah]
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia]
what time you <malay>balik</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah]
ya okay [lah] that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like <malay>turun</malay>
hand over shift
<malay>tujuh setengah</malay> [kan]
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I <malay>malas</malay> so I <malay>tidur</malay> I <malay>tidur</malay> in like the they have like a mass hall but <malay>atas</malay> [ah] on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else <malay>tidur</malay> on the first floor and then I <malay>tidur</malay> on the second floor
<malay>habis naik atas</malay> like <malay>pukul satu pagi</malay> then I was like [eh] ma'am I I go sleep first [ah] then she like [oh] K K I see you upstairs
<malay>habis tidur</malay>
<malay>bangun pukul sembilan pagi</malay> [sia]

<malay>habis dia nya</malay>
night shift <malay>nya semua</malay> paramedics [dah] <malay>balik</malay> then I was like [eh] <malay>encik macam mana</malay> [sia] then he's like [ah] never mind I sign for you I sign for you
reservist
<malay>takkan nak begitu</malay> [sia] [lah]
<malay>balik</malay> on the dot [sia]
actually not really [lah] I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
(mm)
(mm)
night shift I wasn't like that [ah] because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning [kan]
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning [kan]
<malay>dulu</malay>
[orh] me and my friends <malay>selalu keluar</malay> eat breakfast [lah] so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics <malay>balik</malay> station [ah]
ya
last time my rota quite bonded [ah]
one time we <malay>naik basikal</malay>
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already <malay>pergi entah mana nak makan</malay> [lah] or something then my friend <malay>kata</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>aku tertinggal aku ni barang</malay> [ah]
then after that we cycled back and then we <malay>masuk</malay> the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>habis dia orang keluar</malay> then after that the #suay suay# the is like !oi! bicycle <malay>siapa ni</malay> then I was like <malay>encik encik bukan saya punya</malay> bicycle
[ah] that's like fucking eight bicycle [sia]
eight bicycles like parked beside the <malay>siapa tak bingit</malay> [sia]
<malay>nasib baik dia orang tak kena</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya how was it cardiac arrest right
[ah]
cannot [sia]
(mm)
[dah] expect [ah]
(mm)
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
twenty percent a quarter of them [ah] <malay>dapat</malay> shock
[ah]
(mm) depends [ah] depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
<malay>kadang kadang</malay>
no most of the time if <malay>dapat</malay> shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
[oh]
so the pulse [dah] <malay>balik</malay> [ah]
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
no no when was the last time the patient like <malay>dia orang sampai dia</malay> [dah] [dah] gone [kan] so like how long before that did they last see him
[orh] like <malay>depan mata</malay> [ah]
[oh]
why [sia]
ya ya ya
<malay>kadang</malay> [eh] the
when I went back reservist the medic told me <malay>sekarang</malay> they make it compulsory [sia]
all medics
<malay>kena</malay> like you you have to have the my responder app
my time it was like optional
then after that <malay>sekarang dia orang</malay> enforce like you have to download
then after that if you <malay>dapat</malay> the notification <malay>kena pergi</malay> [ah] I mean if you <malay>tak nampak</malay> then #bo pian# [lah] but
they expect you to go
(mm)
[ah]
that's cool
<malay>apa dia orang dapat</malay>
<malay>apa lagi</malay> case (err) the community responder was
the this captain from
(err) division #yishun#
<malay>habis</malay> the this the this captain the the <malay>dia dulu macam</malay> medical officer
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
<malay>habis</malay> my my <malay>kawan nampak dia tengah belakang</malay> was like <malay>belakang selalu macam lepak lepak</malay> [ah]
then after that <malay>dia nampak</malay> the captain <malay>dia terus</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah]
my the the responder is captain [ah] then after that he told us <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> take charge of the scenes <malay>semua</malay> then I was like [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>uar uar</malay> [sia] <malay>aku</malay> give <malay>kau</malay> lesson <malay>engkau buat bodoh</malay> [jer] <malay>macam tu</malay>
so ya
[oh] ya my last
you know my (err) last duty
one of my last few duties [ah] like my (err) the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate [sia] resuscitate the patient <malay>dapat</malay> we gave like I think three or four shocks
[eh] no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
but the <malay>nyonya</malay> was quite <malay>tua</malay> already
then they but the I think it's because
the <malay>dia orang</malay> [dah] <malay>tolong</malay> this <malay>nyonya</malay> out of the toilet then she <malay>terus</malay> collapse so like right from the <malay>mata</malay> [ah] then they immediately call
[eh] usually cardiac arrest <malay>kalau pagi pagi</malay> [kan] it's usually a <malay>macam orang baru bangun baru bangun</malay> then they <malay>jumpa</malay> the body then it's like [dah] <malay>beberap jam</malay> [ah] so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you <malay>dapat</malay> cardiac arrest
<malay>tak boleh</malay> save [ah]
ya it's like
pretty much [lah] but most of the time we still try [ah] just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare [ah] unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing [lah]
and <malay>kena buat</malay> <malay>betul betul</malay> [lah] that time <malay>apa lagi</malay>
(err) my last duty in like my last duty ever <malay>kena dapat</malay> call the this #ah pek# he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we <malay>sampai</malay> and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court [ah]
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor <malay>datang</malay> so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor <malay>buat</malay> you know like got a there's a pace [one] when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
to do that kind
ya
then doctor <malay>buat macam macam</malay> jackhammer [sia] don't know [what]
<malay>macam begitu</malay> then after that <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>pukimak ini apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ini</malay> rabbit [pe] and then after that my paramedic my paramedic <malay>tengah jalan</malay>
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
[sia] [lah] <malay>dia buat apa</malay> [sia] then I was like <malay>betul</malay> in public K <malay>buat betul betul</malay>
the doctor the doctor <malay>buat</malay> <malay>sembarang</malay> then we after that we all like what the fuck [sia] the doctor you know
then he was like like
that's why like <malay>tak tahu malu ke</malay> like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay [what] actually last time medic
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew [kan] you will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
[ah]
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you <malay>kena letak</malay> the [lah] the set up the set <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> the adrenaline <malay>kasi</malay> the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you <malay>buat salah</malay> you <malay>kelam kabut</malay> you don't give it to the paramedic on time <malay>kena maki</malay>
so like everybody will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I <malay>penat</malay>
ya
(err) they started right after I
I know my <malay>encik</malay> was the one who came up with the vehicles [sia] there like that was his project
as in
ya that's true
I think ya <malay>tak salah</malay> I heard they got the thing for <malay>macam orang</malay> morbidly obese
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
cause the normal the normal alpha <malay>sekarang</malay> is fucking <malay>kecil</malay> [sia] like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
(mm) the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>boleh muat</malay>
the new alpha is freaking <malay>sempit</malay> [sia] like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite <malay>sempit</malay> already
so I think like the
plus the <malay>dengan</malay> the stretcher [kan]
like you don't need to <malay>angkat</malay> the stretcher like you just <malay>picik</malay> the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves <malay>bodoh tak nak taruh</malay> in ambulance when we actually convey patients <malay>ke mana yang sedia</malay>
<malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
wait the the guy also a medic [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
[orh] firefighter
[orh] then turn out for
[orh]
ya
actually [ah] the my last cardiac arrest case like <malay>bila balik</malay> reservist <malay>ni</malay> we also turn out with and then after that I <malay>nampak</malay> [kan]
so far <malay>dia orang asyik suruh</malay> the boy <malay>yang buat</malay> then after that <malay>yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian</malay> [sia]

last time I remember they they ask us to download when I was in then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download
then after that I think it was during like our talk or something like that
then <malay>macam kawan pekik</malay>

ya you download already [ah]
the my responder app
