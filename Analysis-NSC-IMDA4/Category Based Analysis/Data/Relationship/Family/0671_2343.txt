(hmm) three wishes right
(uh) <malay>aku rasa</malay> wishes <malay>ni mesti lebih realistik</malay> [lah] <malay>tak boleh yang merepek-merepek</malay> [lah] okay <malay>kalau realistik</malay> wishes <malay>aku rasa aku nak</malay> get rich [lah] one of it [lah] one of it maybe <malay>untuk</malay> get rich
the reason <malay>aku nak kaya pasal</malay> actually (err) <malay>aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan</malay>
I want to help the poor maybe (uh) I feel that (err) it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then <malay>kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi</malay> fit [ah] <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> fit <malay>aku</malay> fit <malay>aku rasa macam aku pergi lari</malay> [ah] (err) <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok# reservoir <malay>ke</malay> macritchie <malay>ke</malay> I feel that (uh) my body feels good [lah] so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
then next (uh) the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes #furqan#
(uh)
my views on what your wishes are it's actually (uh) is very good from what I see you are a people person like (err) like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
superpower okay so (err) we are moving from realistic to not so realistic [ah] okay so superpower <malay>kalau boleh aku nak</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kalau tengok cerita</malay> X men [eh] <malay>dia sikit-sikit macam</malay> night crawler
(err) so <malay>kalau</malay> teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at #tampines# I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like (err) taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
(um) to a certain extent <malay>pasal [lah] tu</malay> (err) <malay>bila teleportation</malay> okay <malay>kononnya tak ada teleportation</malay> [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>kita dah kena</malay> expose more (err) how should I say it (uh) more unknowingly for example <malay>kita naik</malay> <malay>kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>tak ke lebih bahaya kalau kita tak teleport</malay>
<malay>kalau kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>naik</malay> <malay>atau naik</malay> taxi grab driver <malay>ke</malay> taxi driver <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> expose in that (uh) area <malay>kita duduk kat dalam</malay> <malay>ke</malay> <malay>kat dalam kereta ke</malay>
<malay>kita dengan orang yang suspek tak kita tak tahu ni kita tak tahu dia ada ke tidak ni</malay>
<malay>untuk beberapa minit ini</malay> [ah] <malay>ada yang</malay> research <malay>cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau ada</malay> measure measure <malay>contohnya macam</malay> (uh) sanitisation
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say (uh) for example I I share an example [ah]
let's say <malay>nak pergi</malay> giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food (uh) food court I teleport to the place
then after that (uh) I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay (err) you said it can increase because the person (uh) didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so (err) let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about (err) going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and (uh) maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's (uh) maybe (uh) the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
and I rest at work and exposed again <malay>ini tak boleh kalau kita dah</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kita</malay> skip all the buses <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] all the transportation <malay>ini</malay> exposure
we only expose to the office
[ah] which is easier to contact tourists
[ah] <malay>tak kan begitu</malay>
it is (uh) something
(err)
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
<malay>itu haram tu</malay>
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know (err) be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
(err) I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one (err) mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of (uh) being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe (uh) act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but (err)
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it (uh)
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that (err) you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to (uh) ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that (err) you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means (err) if a person is a father
okay so (err) what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of (uh) two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man (uh) should isolate himself
for months
I feel (uh) I I agree to a certain extent (err) where
let's say this person have (uh) no responsibility maybe (uh) no parents no siblings no children no wives then (uh) I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say (err) okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example (uh) a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
but then when this (err) <malay>banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan</malay> (mm) apa ni orang kata</malay>
<malay>kena pergi kursus</malay> [ah] <malay>kursus-kursus</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer</malay>
<malay>menggunakan aplikasi</malay> word excel <malay>kenapa teknologi telah berubah</malay>
<malay>jadi mereka dah</malay> behind time so <malay>ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin</malay> okay <malay>kut</malay>
okay [lah] [eh] <malay>jap</malay> (err) <malay>kita</malay> (err)
<malay>saya teringat</malay> something [ah] <malay>yang pasal</malay> teleportation [ah] kita (uh) <malay>ni</malay> [eh] reverse <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] [eh] teleportation [eh] <malay>kononnya</malay> teleportation <malay>ni kan boleh kita boleh</malay> teleport
(um) <malay>bila kita umur sepuluh tahun</malay>
(uh) <malay>kira-kira ni macam</malay> so called <malay>macam</malay> time machine <malay>begitu</malay> [ah] (uh) <malay>macam</malay> advance <malay>yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya</malay> invention <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah ada ke tidak ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh</malay> teleport reverse time [eh] maybe <malay>kita</malay> teleport ten years old
<malay>nak cakap apa dengan awak punya</malay> (uh) <malay>diri tu</malay> okay <malay>kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia</malay>
actually (err) pretty similar [ah] on on the investment part because (err) actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves (err) a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
(err)
if you were to tell me that investment is (uh) is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe (err) last time I was maybe too good [ah] I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society (err) when they see [oh] a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much (err) about monetary (err) maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old (err) ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more (uh) gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this (uh) money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go (uh) anywhere that I want because (err) there's a certain level of (err) financial freedom I would say
second topic
[oh] my my memory memory is (err) degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
[oh] I admit (uh) do you have you heard of (uh) about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep (uh) items
or (uh) photos [ah] to then (err) to keep in a secret place or maybe (err) some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video (err) it's like a conversation with (uh) my old my my oldest self so let's say (err) my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually (err) when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so (uh) I just hope I don't lose the video [lah] actually I don't even remember where is it now
(hmm) I like to be famous yes
but
but (uh) I think is (uh) if I were to take myself a picture of myself (err) every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
(err) <malay>salah satu</malay> (err) experience <malay>yang aku pernah mengalami</malay> [ah] <malay>adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> real [ah]
<malay>dia</malay> (err) it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving (uh) at #tioman#
one of the nicer waters in (uh) asia that (uh) that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic (err) trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so (err) I think there is (err) what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of (uh) funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that (err) short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then (uh) another (err) much more serious (err)
(uh) experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me (err) makes me (err)
<malay>bulu roma ternaik</malay> [ah] <malay>bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku</malay>
<malay>jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga</malay> so (err) <malay>saya tengah bawa macam biasa</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba</malay> (err) <malay>saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan</malay> (err) <malay>di</malay> road <malay>tersebut</malay> [lah] <malay>di jalan raya tersebut</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>bila saya bawa</malay>
then (err) maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was (uh) I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that (err) jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to (uh) go into (uh) into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then (err)
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that (err) it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually (err) and even (err) just now I was riding a bike
(err) due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so (uh) I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
the person a a driver the driver that (uh) was (err) almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily (err) nothing happen <malay>tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja</malay>
<malay>tapi itu pun</malay> okay <malay>itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu adalah</malay> (uh) experience <malay>saya</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> near death experience or rather I would say a near miss [ah] how about you #furqan#
!oho! <malay>dah macam pantun berkerat</malay>
(uh)
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
(err) someone is (err) or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of (err) delivery riders who is (uh) riding very recklessly around (uh) (uh) on the road [ah] because they are
(err) chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe (uh) road (uh) sorry (uh) lorry drivers lorry drivers
<malay>yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen</malay> (uh) <malay>yang tu semua</malay> [lah] (uh) <malay>dia orang kerja</malay> trip
<malay>lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut</malay> number of trip <malay>kalau dia orang</malay>
(err) less trip
<malay>kan kurang</malay> [lah] <malay>gaji dia orang</malay> [ah] <malay>mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya</malay> (err) <malay>sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak</malay>
(err) <malay>lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dia punya dia punya alasannya</malay> (err)
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because (err) (err) when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example (err) if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can (err) plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering (uh) maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that (err) we are not so (err) I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe (uh) three hobbies one is (err) maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start (err) ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
(err) I would know I'm I'm not really a good (uh) soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because (err) I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that (uh) soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me (err) easily when whenever (err) people especially (uh) in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said [oh] let's play soccer outside
(uh) this way you gain (uh) relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and (err) in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems (err) I think is is is quite interesting
(err)
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some (err) activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure (uh) how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because (err) in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals (err) so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less (err) how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think (uh) as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
(err)
so far I think [eh] all the (err) hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from (err) we are kind of (uh) similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers
