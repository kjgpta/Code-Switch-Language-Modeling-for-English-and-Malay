okay [ah] first <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> regarding our hobby [lah] okay [ah] so you can first what is it your hobby
(um)
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>kalau</malay> for me my hobbies is [ah] I like to read books I like to travel I like to
[ah] mostly spend time <malay>dengan kawan-kawan ke apa</malay> [ah] that is my sort of hobbies that I like
[ah] I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really <malay>suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai</malay> I don't really like it
[ah] so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
(uh huh)
so other than
<malay>punya</malay> brand <malay>tak ada</malay> you don't have any other brand <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>suka ke apa ke</malay>
[kan] and I think you also <malay>suka</malay> Coach
you <malay>pun suka</malay>
[ah] quite lately [lah] I think that <malay>daripada dulu pun</malay> you <malay>memang suka</malay> Coach if not just lately
[ah] so <malay>apa lagi yang</malay> you
you <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>minat selain daripada</malay> bags
okay because for me [ah] whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore [kan] <malay>pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak</malay>
we <malay>apa</malay> more like
<malay>terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu</malay> [kan] so
when you
[ah] yes so is so now when you see for yourself [eh] actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
important the family <malay>makan</malay> and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like <malay>macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa</malay> it's edible [lah] <malay>boleh makan</malay> and there times <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>masak pada</malay> I is
(uh) fantastic [lah] it's good <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] I enjoy eating it which is something good [lah] [kan] hopefully
you can cook [ah] more things [lah]
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] the more the more rounder become most to most
[ah] exercise more [ah] exercise more in the imagination [lah] in reality I won't exercise
[ah] yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
[eh] this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya [lah] ten years ago still can play [lah] but now I think it'd be better
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore <malay>nak main bola dah susah</malay> I I try to ask my friends to play all
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play [ah] maybe
[ah] if I play football with
with #sharif# if the kid maybe can can be done <malay>ataupun</malay>
[ah] I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become [lah]
doubt so [lah] I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it [lah] don't want to waste my energy [ah]
during the malaysia cup [ah]
I think in terms <malay>kalau</malay>
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over [lah] first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
[ah] the whole society <malay>punya</malay> makeup <malay>pun dah</malay> changed I think now we are
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
[ah] whom is like
and the passion is just not there [lah] I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities [ah]
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> passion the thing is passion is there
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
<malay>budak-budak tak ada benda lain</malay>
<malay>budak-budak cuma</malay> only have
[ah] football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
to [ah] play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is <malay>lain</malay>
<malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> when people play is
for the money for the fame [kan] then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
[ah] in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
[ah] I can just [ah] imagine myself to be #ronaldo# or #messi#
on the screen
[kan] if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if <malay>macam</malay>
now like <malay>dulu kalau kita nak tengok</malay> internet <malay>pakai</malay> computer will really stay in front of the computer
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers [kan]
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
<malay>tapi</malay> now even with handphone
you can basically
contact with the with the people
[kan] contact the people <malay>pun</malay>
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things [ah] (um)
(uh huh)
yes
ya so that is the different [lah] people change
[kan] so maybe certain things will be left behind [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] so the
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] the changes in in time [eh] so in order to survive
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time [lah] [kan] cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
[ah] mentality <malay>zaman dulu punya</malay> [kan] <malay>tak nak</malay> handphone <malay>tak nak pakai</malay>
[ah] internet [kan] I think <malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
[ah] impossible [ah] [kan] [ah]
okay (um)
yes
[ah] I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be <malay>apa terlalu ke belakang</malay> if let's say we are too far
[ah] behind [kan] then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
[ah] just nice for his [ah]
or his or her development
in the future [lah] even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
[ah] [ah]
yes correct
[ah]
(um)
[ah]
ya [lah]
have to have to try [lah] [kan] <malay>tu kadang-kadang</malay> when we try <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>susah juga nak nak</malay> catch up [kan] but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that [lah] [kan] okay <malay>sekarang nak</malay>
<malay>berbual pasal apa</malay> topic <malay>lain</malay>
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
[ah]
[ah] but in terms of travelling
<malay>kita takde</malay> [lah] travel <malay>banyak-banyak tempat</malay> [kan] [ah] so for our travel is mostly to
[ah] malaysia [kan]
[ah] [ah] maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia [ah]
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
[ah] (um)
[ah] if not we will be like <malay>apa</malay> every year at least [lah]
[ah] favourite place [ah] favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay [lah] our singapore dollar is strong [lah] then
I think <malay>bila kita pergi tu apa boleh</malay>
so hope <malay>macam apa</malay> we can
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe [kan]
so <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa</malay> [lah]
but it's a really complete
(uh) shopping [lah]
for the clothes only [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
what are the [ah] pattern what is the <malay>perangai yang kita boleh</malay>
[ah] click <malay>atau tak</malay> click what is our
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay [kan] but of course there is there different [lah] when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new [kan] but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is [ah] is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
(err) <malay>kalau bawa</malay>
our kid also will enjoy it more also [lah] [kan]
(uh) but
yes [ah]
[ah] ya [lah] you will set the goal when you go [ah]
[ah] [ah]
[ah] I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part [lah] [kan]
I mean
ya [lah] I think certain things you are more
[ah]
comfortable in handling and
[ah] certain things I am more comfortable in handling [lah] I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
[ah] planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
ya [lah] [ah] when authoritative-ness then
[ah] <malay>apa</malay>
people don't argue with you
[ah] yes [lah] you can <malay>ke depan</malay> [lah]
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
[ah] then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
[ah]
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay [lah]
[ah]
<malay>takda</malay> [lah] at least [kan]
we are realistic [lah] [kan] what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over [lah] I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small [lah] but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it [kan] so that is the difference
[ah] [ah]
[ah] ya
I think for the #jakarta# [one]
when we reach
there we were like [eh]
first thing is the airport [lah]
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
(err) shopping centres (err) in the eighties [kan]
so okay [lah] that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
(uh)
[ah]
ya when we first <malay>sampai</malay> the hotel <malay>tu</malay>
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
[ah] something being kept for so long
it's not rotten [ah] it's like the carpet never wash for so long
[ah] [lah]
[kan] <malay>bila kita sampai</malay>
<malay>bilik tu macam</malay> okay everything go like so olden
[kan] [ah] [ah] so after <malay>lepas dah</malay> the <malay>bilik tu</malay> okay [lah] but overall
quite enjoyable [lah] in #jakarta# the
different way of life
[ah]
yes
yes our wedding
[ah] our wedding planner [ah]
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) [ah] yes
yes correct [ah] [ah]
(um) [ah]
[ah] the third
[ah]
hotel
basically is [ah] it's all paid for
the tour is [ah]
the tour is all planned [ah] so the driver the vehicle all all is provided
basically we are just supposed to
be there
and everything is actually planned for us we just follow [eh]
[ah]
testing [ah] [ah]
#tanah abang#
yes
[ah]
so sometimes [kan] you have to buy <malay>kadang-kadang macam apa</malay>
have to buy clothes same pattern but different colours [kan]
just for the sake of
[ah] getting (err)
cheaper cheaper price [ah] [kan]
because [ah] <malay>dorang tak jual</malay>
they don't sell by one piece one piece
they sell by [oh] you must buy at least three must buy at least four and
so that's why <malay>kadang bila kita</malay> when
we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore
(err)
<malay>dorang beli</malay> to sell at their shop <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
is money yes
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
ask for directions
<malay>nak pergi</malay> [ah]
<malay>itu bukan itu aja</malay> even someone who
open the door for us
just holding the door still will be expecting us to
to <malay>kasi duit</malay>
then <malay>dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua</malay> [kan] [ah]
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] [kan] so other than that
[ah]
ya other than #jakarta# we went to [ah]
[ah] indonesia <malay>juga</malay> #bali# <malay>juga</malay>
is a couple so called couple retreat [ah] two couples [ah]

down there <malay>pun</malay> our friend is a hindu [kan]

looking out for us and
so we we feel safe [ah] then
[ah] the hotel it was [ah] #harris# hotel [a'ah]

in terms of the hotel is is nice [lah] not old not
over not so that impressive but
[ah] okay [lah]
basic necessities are there in terms of the the cleanliness of what you call it you know the cleanliness

[ah] in indonesia [lah] gold coast #bali#
[ah] the way they set up but of course a bit different [lah] first the
the cleanliness of the beach
<malay>tak kotor sangat tapi</malay> to me is [ah]

[ah] we enjoyed a lunch down there
ya <malay>cantik memang cantik</malay> but the place <malay>tempat makan tu</malay> it's like all the buildings

party [kan] so it's that bad [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>memang nasib kita baik</malay> [lah] <malay>kita dapat pergi</malay>

<malay>mana-mana kita nak pergi tanya</malay> flood <malay>ke tak</malay> flood <malay>ke tak kalau dia kata</malay> (um) [ah] longer way (uh huh)
[ah] then one thing about #penang# ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
so <malay>macam kalau apa</malay> even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building <malay>tu di apa</malay>
they conserve so they make it part of the building [kan] which is [ah] a bit
a bit <malay>macam</malay> odd [lah] something good
but
[kan] <malay>kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia</malay>
conserve for the sake of [ah] conserving [ah] sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them [lah] cause they did conserve their [ah]

we try to work things out [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay>
of course [lah] <malay>kadang ada orang</malay> selfish <malay>apa</malay> [kan] so if
that person selfish <malay>tak nak</malay> cooperate [kan]
I will go with the majority [lah] and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue [oh] then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
I will do it [lah] <malay>tapi kalau dah tak boleh</malay> [kan]
<malay>aku dah cakap kau tak nak dengar</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> get into <malay>masalah</malay>
<malay>kau suruh aku</malay> handle <malay>aku</malay> I feel <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] <malay>tak apa tak adil tak adil</malay> [kan] so I will always go for fairness
[ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
[eh] [lah]
<malay>leher</malay> [ah]
yes the neck <malay>tapi macam</malay> the neck only can show where to turn
[kan] <malay>tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang</malay> decide <malay>nak</malay> turn <malay>atau tidak</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya [kan] so <malay>sebab itu kita</malay> as a <malay>keluarga</malay> we are as a unit [kan] so we want to move we want to move as a unit
<malay>kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini</malay> [kan] then <malay>kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat</malay>
<malay>dia tak</malay>
affect <malay>tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah</malay> then
really have to <malay>apa</malay> explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue [lah] [kan] so the issue now is whether <malay>dapat</malay> settle <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> hopefully <malay>akan dapat</malay> settle [lah] [kan]
<malay>dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] I don't want to <malay>halang</malay>
<malay>kalau dia nak</malay> [kan] <malay>kita akan</malay> we are
[ah]
in terms of <malay>nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] yes
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>ubat</malay>
[ah] yes
[ah] cousin [ah]
<malay>tergantung</malay> it's very <malay>susah</malay> [lah] then
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best [lah]
I I submit document I submit application
<malay>semua dah buat</malay> [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
the thing is is like that
[kan] <malay>kata orang tu</malay> [kan]
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother [lah] [kan]
but now the organisation <malay>bukan satu tempat</malay>
they are two different organisations so <malay>yang ini tempat</malay> check
<malay>yang ini untuk</malay>
[ah] <malay>masa depan</malay>
for future <malay>yang ini untuk apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain</malay> so
have to go through a lot of places [lah]
whether it will improve <malay>ke tak</malay>
the future
<malay>tak juga dia</malay> different criteria [kan] like example <malay>kalau macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> in order to apply for example [ah] to apply for need
[ah] certification that he is autistic then <malay>dah pergi</malay> minds minds <malay>dah</malay> certify <malay>dia dah</malay> [ah] settle
then after that <malay>nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula</malay> [oh]
certification from (uh) minds <malay>tak cukup</malay>
you have to go through a certain
[ah] doctor [lah] doctor or hospital or what okay so <malay>pergi</malay> doctor <malay>punya</malay> hospital
happen doctor hospital <malay>tu pun</malay> [ah] okay [lah] willing to help okay he did that part
then after that <malay>bila nak</malay> apply for <malay>apa</malay> for <malay>apa</malay> cash in life for home caregiving [kan] [oh]
cannot we only we only accept those who are <malay>apa</malay>
authorised by us to do the [ah] assessment so go through check up again
so (um) (um)
[ah] [ah]
<malay>risiko</malay> there and the the thing is
okay [lah] <malay>macam cakap macam macam kita ni</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> for <malay>macam untuk adik ni</malay>
I am willing to <malay>usaha</malay> [kan] and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support [lah]
so <malay>kita kena buat</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi macam</malay> you try imagine
<malay>kalau</malay> [lah] all these checks
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done [kan]
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then [ah]
yes correct and the thing is <malay>pula</malay>
<malay>kita pergi</malay> check up <malay>ni bukan</malay> free
everytime <malay>pergi</malay>
[ah] <malay>kena bayar ke apa</malay> [kan] but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds <malay>tolong</malay>
<malay>percuma</malay> free
[ah] even the hospital [one] happen epilepsy <malay>punya</malay> doctor [kan] so there is no extra charges [lah] and
