okay right
so probably (err) I will start [lah]
so my question is regarding the wedding preparation
okay so from my understanding right <malay>apa tu</malay>
the <malay>kadi</malay> is you book the <malay>kadi</malay> from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them <malay>apa tu</malay>
directly [ah]
okay
okay
ya
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] it's okay [ah]
it's okay <malay>tak payah banyak-banyak</malay> then ya
(hmm)
[oh] okay <malay>jadi kalau kadi tu macam</malay> stay further but you select that <malay>kadi</malay> because you prefer also okay [lah] [oh]
(mm) okay
okay I see
okay okay
okay
(mm)
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
[oh] I see that means <malay>kalau</malay> if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
[oh]
[oh] I I I I <malay>takut</malay> what or not I <malay>takut</malay> go in [ah] then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend [kan] then is charges <malay>takde</malay> [eh]
okay
there there there is any amendment (err) there's there's charges [ah] ya
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> on that day is your date available already [lah] on the
[oh] haven't
ya
[oh] okay okay
[oh] I see so <malay>kirakan</malay> before the date available
you go in you select the <malay>kadi</malay> so (err) I mean you play with the form <malay>tapi</malay> you don't submit
[oh]
[oh] I I was thinking of doing that <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>macam takut</malay> #tersubmit# then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference [ah] the the charges [ah] and then ya so but I was also curious [ah] I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very (err) sought much sought sought after [lah] so don't want to make the mistake [ah] then that time you book <malay>masa tu nya</malay> (err) it's a sunday
<malay>mesti</malay> popular [kan] but then (err)
(err) how fast [ah] did did did sold out as in do you like wait the the night when the the date became available or you just wait the next day you submit
[oh]
okay
[ah]
<malay>takut tak dapat</malay> [kan]
okay
(mm) okay cause I also have to settle quite a number of things [ah] cause for #dewi# side [kan]
<malay>dia punya</malay> cause the dad is <malay>bukan</malay> is a non-muslim <malay>jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke</malay> I think <malay>sepuluh</malay> then
[oh] [oh]
[oh] I think about ten [ah] ya but <malay>dia ada lagi satu</malay> (err) <malay>punya susah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> (um) <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak boleh apa tu</malay>
(err) <malay>kalau buat dekat</malay> (err) location <malay>lain</malay> [kan] <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> cannot be <malay>yang</malay> full time staff
so full time staff <malay>sana ada</malay> about <malay>tiga orang</malay> so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english [ah] so my (err) number of <malay>kadi</malay> shrink shrink then <malay>entah abeh sekarang</malay> nowadays I cannot see the <malay>kadi</malay> reviews on the web [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
but the the videos are removed ya so I like
so I also don't know but I know #salim jasman# I saw the video [lah] so I thought
he's okay he's fast I prefer <malay>pasal dia nya dia nya</malay> style is like
<malay>berbual sikit</malay> then go
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada satu</malay> (err) <malay>kadi tu dia</malay> quite quite
very eloquent [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> I <malay>tengok dia nya</malay> video [kan]
[ah] they they drag on
[ah]
ya ya (mm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
ya <malay>pasal sekarang</malay> I know <malay>yang satu kadi ni yang</malay> I identified this #salim jasman# I saw
<malay>cara dia buat macam betul</malay> relax [ah] (err) he just
(err)
I think he is not very particular as long as he can hear the person say and he just proceed
[oh] okay
okay
yup
ya
busy [ah]
okay
(mm) okay (mm) (mm)
okay okay
[oh] okay okay
[oh] the okay (uh huh)
<malay>tapi bagus</malay> [ah] because you <malay>tak ingat</malay> then that means also no stress [lah] <malay>bila baca baca</malay> [jer] [ah]
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds <malay>baku</malay> ya
ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga</malay> ya
(hmm) okay I see then ya
<malay>tapi yang kadi tu</malay> is your family <malay>punya</malay> (err) acquaintance [ah]
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> by then you don't know who that colleague is [lah]
(mm)
ya
okay (mm) okay <malay>jadi kirakan</malay> my plan <malay>sekarang</malay> is to go to the website fill up all the details then <malay>tapi bila dia punya</malay> date available submit straight (mm)
okay
okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tapi dia</malay> to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through [kan] okay

(mm) okay same here okay <malay>jadi kalau</malay> time slot <malay>dia</malay> is (err) <malay>macam mana tu satu kadi</malay> can have more than one time slot [ah]
I mean based on your experience
[oh]
[oh] then ten to twelve will be very (err) quite hot [ah]

[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ye</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi yang</malay> cake <malay>ni</malay> is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay

<malay>tapi mak andam sampai</malay> the whole day [mah]
so no no point right
okay okay
okay

<malay>sama</malay> [lah]
bread and butter right
okay
(mm) okay
okay
okay
okay okay
okay
okay
!huh!
okay
okay
okay okay
(mm) okay [lah] angry [lah]
okay
<malay>cuma cuma dia punya masa tu</malay> thinking is <malay>dia nak pergi sana cepat</malay> so <malay>dia ada</malay> time to makeup [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) okay [oh] okay okay
for bride [lah] ya you <malay>dah</malay> plan [pe]
ya okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tu tak boleh jadi</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh</malay> [seh]
!huh! [oh]
<malay>kirakan sekarang ni macam</malay> they are <malay>macam</malay> (err) they messed up the (err) planning
some some some <malay>mak andam</malay> because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning [lah] okay
okay
okay <malay>dia</malay> panic [lah] okay
okay
<malay>kirakan</malay> flexible [lah] okay okay (uh huh)
(mm) <malay>jadi kirakan kalau macam</malay> if we do <malay>nikah</malay> and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
ya okay
yes yes and traffic jam you don't know whether
okay
[oh] <malay>kirakan bukan pasal</malay> delay <malay>pasal</malay> they earn more [lah] no [lah] we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
<malay>tapi</malay> [oh] but you know how their charges are is like per whole [oh] not [oh]
but usually they won't try to delay unless really special occasion [ah] ya
okay
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> #prata# okay
a bit greasy [ah]
<malay>sakit perut</malay>
[oh] most of your friend also do at fort canning [ah]
okay
I see
okay <malay>jadi mak andam</malay> is not requirement unless you have (err) several outfit change
[oh] okay okay <malay>jadi sama</malay> [lah] I think for my side I think I don't want to have <malay>mak andam</malay> I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have (err) ya
(mm) but but she have no experience
true also
okay
okay
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah] cause you want what you want [lah] okay
okay
I I even thought of what you know because <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>katong sana</malay> [kan] there are many (err) salon ya then we thought (err) go there early ya
but that will be strange
(mm)
ya cause very close [eh] because <malay>yang</malay> grand mercure <malay>ada banyak</malay> salon ya how good [ah] that's why I have to go there okay
peranakan day [ah] so I think ya I have to go there early
ya <malay>dia pun</malay> I email <malay>juga</malay> (mm)
(mm)
okay so that part
ya I have to ask #dewi# to do research [lah] then from there
most likely we also will do the same thing [lah] <malay>kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi</malay> [ah] the day <malay>macam</malay> one off <malay>saja</malay> [lah]
[oh] okay <malay>mak andam</malay> is for rental cause they got special rate
ya [lah] and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding [mah]
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> of course photography on the same day is the best [lah] cheapest [ah] cheapest [lah] because you do makeup all that
[oh] okay so we do the <malay>nikah</malay> and the photography after that
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
(mm)
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause (err) lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
<malay>paling senang dekat dalam</malay> hotel <malay>tu tak boleh gerak-gerak</malay>
(mm) okay
ya
(mm) ya <malay>dia nya</malay> swimming pool I ever went it looks nice [lah] so I think I need to ask the person on that day
whether to see okay
(mm) we can go up and see [ah]
(mm)
<malay>bila</malay>
really [ah] you mean you all what wedding day
you want to book the hotel [oh] we thought of booking hotel for you all so
!huh! is
okay
lucky you tell me [eh] cause we really thought of booking for you all also then dinner we can go eat ya okay
okay ya okay ya let us know [lah] because we thought of (err) booking [lah] ya
okay
okay then ya so
three three (err) I think for for your case [kan] <malay>tiga jam macam</malay> okay [ah] very manageable
ya it's is very fast I like that
<malay>apa yang</malay> teething problems
I I know one problem that you all face is the
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem <malay>aku</malay> outside [mah] but I can see people no space sit ya
(mm)
!huh! [oh] they stay back [oh]
(mm)
<malay>pasal panas</malay> [oh] ya [lah] <malay>hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat</malay> (err) lawn <malay>tu</malay> mostly <malay>budak-budak</malay> parents <malay>semua tak pergi</malay> [seh] [ah]
yes yes I saw I saw it's quite (um)
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the <malay>nikah</malay>
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
for for my case okay [lah] <malay>terus</malay> settle
(um) but it's during the (err) the you you guys got the how is it how I can't remember the walk in [ah] how you guys did the walk
is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
[oh] then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again [ah]
cause for for (err) the place I have right there's a stage <malay>jadi kalau kirakan</malay> okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> start at eleven thirty
then everything finished at twelve thirty
[eh] wait [ah]
I remember is a eleven to three [ah] ya
okay
[ah] I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
<malay>lagi-lagi kalau apa tu</malay> like what you said
<malay>betul juga tapi</malay> wedding <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang macam</malay> panic [kan] <malay>jadi ada sikit</malay> problem <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma apa tu</malay>
(err)
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my <malay>nikah</malay> so
<malay>nikah</malay> plus (err) tea ceremony ya
that is the main main core concept
[oh] I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
ya [lah] <malay>siapa nak ikut</malay> to the letter [kan] yes
she don't care
yes
okay cause I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
[ah] that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
<malay>kirakan</malay> I want to like <malay>macam</malay> eleven thirty to one for example is <malay>nikah</malay> tea ceremony and then
that's also the time <malay>kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar</malay> [lah]
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about (err) one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty [ah] then whole lunch [ah] then in between before the one thirty starts right (err) we have the walk in [lah] then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans [lah] some activity [lah] so for about ya
okay <malay>tapi kalau</malay> COVID <malay>dia ada</malay> different kind of rules [ah] only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
(err) out of that twenty they have to be in their table [oh] but <malay>mungkin</malay> maybe <malay>masa tu</malay> policy <malay>belum</malay> start [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I went to the Grand Mercure right and (err)
#katong# and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
[ah]
<malay>tapi tapi kalau ada apa-apa nanti kena</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> COVID infection [ah]
okay
hopefully [lah] okay
okay I see but only worry like (err) <malay>yang</malay> table <malay>yang tak</malay> mingle boring [ah] <malay>duduk tengok</malay> each other <malay>makan</malay> cannot mix with the you know
so I thought of what you know get some emcee or what [ah] ya
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> your wedding <malay>lain</malay> [tau] your wedding can mingle is a is different cause (err) your time can be taken [ah] you know speaking [ah]
<malay>kena</malay>
simple simple (hmm) okay <malay>kalau</malay> [ah]

okay
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> if I
(hmm) okay okay [oh] I <malay>itu yang</malay> category <malay>macam</malay> (err) emcee [ah] <malay>yang macam</malay> too much [lah] that's why
ya I want the like (err) formal one simple one
