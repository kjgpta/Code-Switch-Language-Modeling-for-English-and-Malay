I don't know what kerapu
I think I tengok first because usually for me
something fancy for tengah hari lah makanan tengah hari lah
uh nasi you know
fancy tengah hari macam nasi kalau malam more like salad lah because of your condition right because of your kencing manis right your diabetes
for the for me the kids kalau ada nasi ada ikan they will eat lah
uh but I don't want to buy tadi bila I beli ikan tu I tak nak beli banyak ikan takut nanti simpan dalam ice box bau so I rather just buy satu ekor ikan lah
dari beli dua ekor itu hari I beli dua ekor abeh tak dapat habis
you know susah nak habis abeh end up buang you know so I rather not
sebab tu tadi bila kat sheng siong tadi
I beli satu ekor ikan aje
uh tapi ada kala pula I feel serba salah when I do that kena beli satu pula nanti the kids I want some more fish you know macam
kadang-kadang pula bila masak ada plan tapi mak bawa makan ke
you know atau my mother give food untuk uh she packed food from from her house right then she give also that would also
I have to wah I edit punya rak
tapi semalam punya not not that bad lah but it's just a simple two three pages
jadi macam eh
you know macam if you sit you if you did it this way for your write article you will have less problem lah I would have edited even faster but semalam I
I edit tak I didn't really require a lot of time lah think within less than one and a half hour
or less than two hours dah habis ah edit
uh tadi I berbual dengan my
my russian teacher tu the skype over skype eh
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was err he was a having a conversation with his friends our uh what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me yang
I and the song was from tokyo square then she's like tokyo square so he thought that dia dari jepun ke group ni then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean lah it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was uh
but the song actually nice tapi dia pakai lagu sukiyaki punya lagu tau do you know sukiyaki right there's this
uh it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow kak tina to this concert by tokyo square
uh that is the originally is from tokyo square but there's some uh famous mat salleh singers sing that song lah western singers that err sing err tokyo square punya lagu but that is I say macam singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
a lot of talent lah they don't macam you know
uh but dia punya melody has been reused and reused by other bands lah but that is not the most famous tokyo square
uh because like I mean nama tokyo square tapi dari singapore you know macam
because my I think kak tina did some events ah for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
and that they were performing dekat mana tau kat depan if I am not wrong eh at this padang area near parkway parade
no macam this area dekat depan parkway ke sebelah kat parkway ke one of those area lah because parkway was you it was like a famous lah you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center dekat eighties nineties mana ada banyak
I think kalau mungkin mungkin yang singapore yang rock band lah yang dulu-dulu ah
ah the malay rock band ramli sarip all that there is known tapi for the english
medium eh english medium tak banyak that's why tokyo squares is one of tapi yang you kata sam willows sekarang famous there were a few ah
like they say kembangkan dia punya talent ah
you know macam yang ada english the err english medium ada but they are not
they are not world famous lah macam the their world famous because they perform
like macam siapa jacintha ah jacintha abisheganaden I think abisheganaden is it halim
but macam you have err macam art fazil you have err jai eh is it jai is it the
I think macam we we we know okay like macam acting a lot of them because of the
the khairul anuar join siapa apa
the malay channel lah siapa tu
ah not really talent train lah it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market macam kira malaysia ada market you know
macam nak cakap pasal comedian ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar comedian pun comedian macam err suhaimi eh suhaimi part time you know at least dia dia part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
no I think macam pasal singapore banyak pakai script
singapore the the ah they're not very good with improvisation tak bagus
ah I I I understand macam boboi boboi punya jokes eh boboi the group the maharaja lawak eh kan they have boboi they have the different
ah what is that either let like either when they talk about loghat eh there's always a tema tema like like loghat like is always going to be malaysia menang because singapore tak pandai buat loghat you know
they can really do loghat know and they really are very good at imitating macam singapore punya macam they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know macam malaysia really bercakap loghat loghat is accent right kira loghat orang kedah orang kelantan and then
kita punya loghat is loghat bahasa baku
no no but they are very professional I remember I pergi err the not kedung kodek what's that
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching pi mai pi mai tang tu at that time was imuda imuda that there were some people sayang they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform ee apa tu they can really perform macam
buat masa yang berpanjangan tau macam ada stamina is really that atau buat orang macam orang pergi kelantan kelantan they they the people doing dikir barat
they can really do dikir barat the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
uh macam for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs lah
the yang yang lama-lama lah
dia kata orang glamour ada what is that ah
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia dia perform astro punya lah
I think astro punya organise so ya guest judge was
ah tapi dia ada all the the veteran singer so hady was face off with this other
ah so they have this person in the end dia menang dua-dua two of them memang kan
why now you know macam like in a way kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat malaysia you know
ya pasal dia dah then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really menyanyi is really his talent you know
no but macam I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series eh
junior eh yuan ching you tahu you kenal dia was she some
ya zoe tay was from your ni
yuan ching yuan ching yang dekat jurong eh
no but but you had that yuan ching punya alumni yuan ching punya alumni is it yuan ching
yuan ching macam hancing the the yuan ching punya alumni dinner right you eh
err your friends apa ashik eh siapa
amin kan dia orang tak pergi eh
I told you the three of you form a table what with your other friends and sama kelas
now memang susah
cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar jer
is it badan besar rambut putih eh
ya macam macam macam seroja was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
you know to be ya I mean be err get get new more books you know but macam the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just macam seroja
you you are I'm not I'm older than you sayang
ah tu ah si si siapa was telling me these millennials ah because it's
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right mana tengok seroja I tengok kesian ah
dia beli rumah tu about satu point satu satu point dua juta tau
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to uh buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house pun err
uh it's slow down macam orang pun tak nak beli
rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu I think
uh dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual
macam tinggi lah tak nak jual harga tinggi lah she just want to sell uh
ah and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle dekat
her condo tu kan not near the beach right so macam
to her is an effort lah to go back and forth naik basikal di situ and I think a bit ulu lah because situ kan jauh kan
she like cycling but macam
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but macam
for me when I see her I tengok I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
macam is typical of err they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
macam still tinggal that rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual and still have err her she's start to pay ready for her house
no no hers was second hers was a new lepas tu dia kata ada
ah tapi besar because rumah dia belum habis renovate eh because they had to for stall the
uh the no the the macam kira development dah habis semua tapi orang semua I think they nak renovate ah sikit-sikit kan
tapi pasal renovation kena put on hold because of the COVID
so I was thinking to myself oh not bad eh dia tak payah jual rumah in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to jual rumah so maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta I mean she's already nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
maybe she has the money ada duit juga ah
that one betul-betul ada err pool or view of the pool ya
tiga tiga bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice sayang it was like
uh I think I think for dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal condo she shared with a flatmates dulu dia tinggal dekat sekarang dia tinggal kat condo I think she found a new flatmate eh and then macam kat kat russia kan they don't have this quality of
uh so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware lah about the development about about buying condo uh that dasha is aware so macam macam it's very sexy lah
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because dekat itu dekat dengan russian nya embassy
and and then dekat bukit timah dia nak dekat dengan nature agaknya orang putih gitu kan
ah shared dengan ramai ramai ramai
I tak tahu I never ask
uh but I think she like the location agaknya
uh because this mat salleh they like their nature they like
uh dia naik bus dia dia orang naik bus
because maybe the flatmate yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya
they're not really macam kita a bit rude about money we talk about money like macam I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think dasha will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about macam
macam it's not really the thing lah macam us cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual
you tahu this this year I don't see her spending anything dia tak beli baju baru
mungkin dengan boyfriend dia ke apa kita tak tahu kan mungkin ada boyfriend lah
kalau like that okay eh
uh but sami suka
macam dia dia kata dia ada swimming pool kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna kan uh that's fixed to me condo lah
macam some of the aminah punya friends right they tinggal condo ah
uh macam err I guess that's macam we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
yang pak ali eh you know pak ali always get the best grades macam dean's lists lah borhan also the one the radio warna right but they were from it doesn't
macam ya people used to think that err
he was educated sayang he was educated when he was young he was educated in eton tau
did I ask him what did you do he's baba budak orang baba
dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi tuition
dia pergi tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
uh teaching macam he has he has his full time job
even after tu dia continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so macam you know you have this
but he's very nice lah I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time kita because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you berbual and then dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang so most of the time we speak melayu and baba so
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him oh can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me lah of course lah he won't pay for it lah but because it's my mahal right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there dia beli dia ingat I don't know how it is now terrence
no no no dia nak pergi actually tak nak pergi singapore
tapi dia kata dia not good enough lah dasha kata sebab tu eton they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually eton then after that the eton got
a professor but dia orang lah
or american eh but very fluent in russian and then because err project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but macam macam russian only a few know
uh tapi be you know why they go to russia because dia punya tuition fee
singapore I tak tahu but uh
so there were err she was speaking russian to her husband and dia she have two children two or three children they all go to sabah or sarawak then after that yang orang kat belakang dia there's this man ah err medical doctor
dia kata oh he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns err medicine in russia
no but I think is in a hospital in malaysia dia orang recognize
I think wait singapore punya that they have a different different tu ah
because I remember my friend you know yang arwah nadim tu yang meninggal tu isteri dia
belajar medicine dekat kelantan lah if I'm not wrong kelantan also
but kelantan ni banyak
but kelatan punya he he actually don't want to go there he doesn't want her to stay there
tak recognise kelantan punya medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes dia come back
err to be dia kerja kat mendaki kan arwah dia until he very sick already he went over there
um but yang your friend tu siapa
yang your friend tu yang follow kita tu pergi kashmir siapa tu
you know that the hair stylists yang I pergi the hairdresser tu yang pergi kedai cina tu anak perempuan dia tak boleh masuk dekat medicine school dekat singapore so she actually took out a I think two hundred thousand dollar loan
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka australia
ah because dia tak stress lah macam singapore
kan bilang
err so pula dapat keluar pergi luar negeri
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology siapa si
ustazah yang teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example yang daripada
apa eh
it's not considered a degree level macam for example you want to be a teacher right
yes that's what my ustaz told me
so macam it has to be like they recognize degree
jordan I tak tahu
could be ah because mak dia mak dia tak nak but but but uh the ustaz kata that's the reason macam for example kita dapat second upper the second upper uh or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya that's why like people say why they go to madrasah for that's the big question everybody ask
agaknya ah tu
I don't know now err COVID I tak tahu ah
so that's why a lot of people recommend pergi jordan
there's dia orang punya
kan itu hari si king of jordan datang
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like tiga empat daripada eygpt and then she knows other dialect lah so dia kata ada kesian because she was telling me because dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz
ustaz hasan so dia bilang ah dia bilang dengan I lah some of them come from negeri yang you know they come from kampung so only know dialect tau dia orang tak tahu so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend ah
and this lady have a condition ah dia kata then I ask err your cousin eh how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into eh a'ah kak tini bukan senang you know like nak kena ni nak kena surgery nak kena ni can you imagine nak kena like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap lah nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people agaknya derma I think embassy derma agaknya and then spend money on them you know err spend the money on translations err these translators
oh ya because the the king would err hussein not hussein I I I kenal bini dia uh he was very impressed the singapore side very cepat very efficient
but when I was telling doctor ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia showing off
uh that is the rumour lah that she tunjuk the jam
ya but it's also something that has strength lah because her fusha is very good like the orang arab dengar fusha lah yang I try to berbual dengan ustazah hadijah
itu fusha but okay so macam the the difficult dialect is not egyptian lah according to them lah but I don't know I tengok egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt punya dialect very near fusha the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
banyak orang arab banyak kan very diverse
dia tinggal kat egypt itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama she even take she even take talaqqi courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take talaqqi she taught she taught me how to tajwid
she told me yang the and then when I ask abi abi say betul
ada yang ustaz yang famous sampai boleh kalau you buat salah your bacaan sampai boleh ambil you know your you know the what is that thing ah
when they collect the smoke the cigarette punya ashes leh
like garang ah
let her bukan poly tak boleh pakai tudung pakai jer tudung kat poly
or you want her to go okay lah go pakai then there's the other thing lah
I think err tengok appetite dia macam math and science
in singapore you cannot do well macam
macam I don't think so lah
err namanya
tak tahu ah I just tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat lah but she's very close to murni so now she's the
punya translation unit she she's the head you know
pasal I selalu berbual dengan dia
then I made her watch asian alida bahasa melayu I even I even err
gunakan err
apa tu penterjemahan eh
penterjemah subtitle ah dalam bahasa melayu
dia suka ah mula-mula tak suka mula-mula tanya apa mak maknya tu kau tak sayang nyawa kau eh you know the cerita ejen ali kau tak sayang nyawa kau
no I think pasal dia dia daripada kaku dia macam kaku but the my mum was very impressed that dia menonton filem tanggang eh dari awal hingga akhir so I said what's happening you know
anak going
tapi tapi dia suka dia suka tengok my computer ah
okay kita punya ni nak tamat sayang
but she also get shares which I am I think she her limit is three to four hours after that she like okay don't need computer pun takpe ah she has this limit ah
I think in really should learn I know kata takpe sekarang ni tengah tengah waktu akhir dah dah peperiksaan dah berakhir pun masih masih nak belajar I said no lah no nothing belajar I said this is like membaca buku
berbual-bual know like you know those things ah
no because because when when I made the order dorang they asked for the ya lah they asked for your options like what do you want
okay ya so the cake is now the chocolate orange cake with Nutella kan ya then the macaron my mum biar dia choose lah cause different different colour let her choose ah but she cause she
ya the colour is the flavour so dia ada different different flavour lah so but my mum choose like the colours that are ah but the the taste the taste is not that different lah for macaron manis jer dia punya taste a bit a bit jer
tak dia maximum three flavours ya so so the bottom two the bottom two tier is one flavour the second two tier is one flavour the one two tier is one
mm tak
I ah cari-cari lah kat instagram
ya I read all the reviews apparently all the reviews say the macarons are good so I try the macaron I tak tahu that's that's the thing that's why I rather take the macarons cause the reviews a lot on macarons
nak order order birthday cake first ah
ya but then but I already pay deposit lah so whatever lah kita tawakkal jer
ya cake is the ya I think the remaining I just need to find out dia ada minta macam I think they ask for two hours time frame the that one I don't understand lah I ask uh don't know they haven't reply ah whatever ah nanti ah tapi that the cake is still a long time pe the day on the wedding baru dapat pe
I don't know I just cause their phrasing for that question is like very weird so I was like what do you mean by this tapi dorang belum reply so nanti ah just wait for them to reply

ya so biar lah biar lah dia mak pengantin
ya but he didn't ask tak I I called him actually I I wanted to ask about the package cause I need to order the wedding cake ya I I want to

that's the thing so tak kan nak kasi macam kawan kita datang abeh dorang tak dapat makan seh it's not a buffet get it that's the part that they're not they don't understand
yang yes fine I can put them as crew macam like so that you get more seats but they won't get to eat lah because they are not itu pe a'ah the food is only fifty pax what

ya then you meet me at the hotel baru kita datang sama-sama lah I mean ya I mean we will just gonna I don't know ya the thing is because dia cakap we have from seven to ten abeh dia cakap kalau bridal use the room but we also don't have much time before that what
mm not enough time lah nak makeup
ya ya biar lah I don't think nak kena tanya mak andam juga ni like like will you follow me uh to the venue or tak ya cause kalau tak dia buat kat rumah then lepas tu dia jalan pe
pak andam usually is your brides man what eh brides man groomsman
alah kalau gitu rizal tahu lah
a'ah rizal dengan syam rizal dengan syam semua buatkan hafiz pe

I think ya I think it's part of the package awak pun nak kena is it awak kena tiga kan
tengok lah tengok my mum suruh
takpe I tengok kalau dia tanya kak kau nak pakai inai ke tak tak yah lah ah okay lah ah kalau dia macam gitu okay kalau dia cakap eh kau merepek pakai lah inai ah then tu makna terpaksa
tak perlu lah hafiz pun tak pakai
and lepas tu ada lain benda ah ah pasal yang food serving
ya cause after nikah nikah selalu berapa lama fifteen minute twenty minute
mm tak ah ambil gambar jer lah abeh lepas nikah dah ambil gambar
doa ada doa kena doa bismillah gitu
okay lah so so fine eight thirty nanti uh the thing is actually kita dah short of time tau
ya nak ambil gambar orang nak ambil gambar kita
ya abeh kita tak makan ah
sekejap ah like the last ah last last eh we are photo taking tiga puluh minit sudah eh
ah okay okay so okay so awak take note err for lepas nikah kita cakap the food is served at eight thirty walaupun apa jadi just serve jer because it's gonna be on the table jer kan
ya so so just eight thirty a'ah macam eight thirty eight thirty gitu okay start serving lah like once once dorang dah they feel like nikah tu dah is okay to make noise already then they can just go
tak lah
tak kesah lah kita nak makan we still need to cake cut okay
like okay dengar dengar dengar that's why I say ya we'll go by table that's why I say biar let them serve the food after this lepas nikah lepas tu okay just ask rizal to okay um now the food while the food is served we will go table by table to take pictures eh like each person ah
ah but first of course our parents first ah ya of course of course our parents first lepas tu dah lepas tu dah continue ah so in the meantime people come people go back and then just makan jer ah like that one time so once we are done dah lima puluh orang then we can just go join them makan tapi cake cut kita belum
selalu cake cutting first kan selalu cake cut is the first kan
ya ke
eh okay lah okay lah okay then then the cake will be the last because after that kita terus kasi and then kita kasi dorang then they just cabut kan together with the berkat kan okay okay so oo but I need to remember to buy packaging to give the macaron and the cake macaron macaron boleh bawa balik the cake boleh makan tak ah plastic okay lah macaron plastic okay lah
macam macam yang kopi ke tak kopi punya ah itu okay tak lah on macaron ya allah macaron
tak itu itu nanti saya suruh siti siti siti bagus siti kan baker
ah tu yang nanti siti nanti suruh siti tolong anokan
ya so eight thirty makan table by table take photo and then once we done we join bila kita dah habis blah blah
baru kita cake cutting cake cut okay dah jalan-jalan dah
so table by table kita makan by the time should be nine thirty lah tak kan kita makan lama sangat ada chance pun saya pun macam tak terasa nak makan a'ah lepas tu suruh dorang bungkus makan
shouldn't be lah kalau pergi table by table should be tak terlepas ah
I think so confirm rizal sabo nya dia mesti sabo punya like uh korang ada apa words to each other oh okay we both have a few words conjointly rizal kau irritating okay dah dah siap eh okay then something else I want to ask lah something else I wanted to ask the venue but I forgot ya lah yang pasal deejay tu are they giving cause dia cakap remember yang pasal spotify cakap just give us and then we will play it for you
oh ya okay okay so so can kita lupa pula nak tanya pasal tu sound board ah you tanya dia like who is is someone manning the sound board supposed to be from our side or you want your person to jaga your sound board
ya so so just ask him kalau tak takpe I just standby hafiz hafiz nanti kau pergi
wait eh nanti nanti ya it's just fade down fade up actually kalau rizal boleh buat pun rizal boleh buat sendiri jer bila dia nak berbual just fade down sendiri lepas tu dia berbual bila dia dah habis dia off mic lepas tu dia pergi ah lepas tu dia pergi balik to the sound board to just ah macam fade up lagu sikit ke ya atau actually awak boleh set kan on the board auto fade down

ya lah awak nak cakap cakap ah
ee banyaknya
dia cuma nak duit jer buat apa nak talk to dia buat fifty fifty fifty right technically it's including am dia ikut pe
tapi memang nak kena gitu kalau dah invite banyak you need to engage an ambassador to make sure that everyone is ya it's better to have rather than nanti everyone all standing at there in front and then kena saman might as well you hire an ambassador to make sure everyone is abiding with the safe entry rule ya lah
dia boleh buat cuma siapa nak jaga macam shah ibrahim easy dia hire an ambassador that's his way tapi kita ah bila kita buat siap nak
oo I remember the question that I want to ask tukang ambil temperature
tak but ya siapa yang jaga is it our people or his people
ah just ask awak just ask put down and just ask jangan I think I think nanti saya datang eh don't have anyone ya it's err you need to ask someone from your side to do it barangkali banyak gitu pe
I don't think so cause dia tak minta dia tak kesah kalau submit name I think hotel hotel yes macam restaurant ke
I ya we really need someone to jaga the tempat seh I think rahmat have to do it I think rahmat have to do it jaga-jaga macam nanti orang datang oh cik eh cik duduk kat sini eh cik duduk kat situ eh atau atau beforehand beforehand kita buat allocation and then we update them okay you be seated at table what table what that's why we need I put I put first thirty first october is their last date to so first november kita confirm everything we assign wherever and then we can send out like send again lah macam their confirmed punya table if any changes please let us know beforehand so we can make necessary changes and all that
then wait nanti after merisik I think um the week saturday we can send out the invitation lah
can merisik is on fourth october which is sunday then the following saturday can send out the invitation so we got one week to print out whichever siapa-siapa yang awak nak kasi the hard copy then we can print out
I will I share with you ah eh got google this I dah buat schedule perangai perangai production manager cause I'm like I tengok I need to see the dates huh
ya that's why now I use mine ah I already apa apply eh pakai twenty four hours tu ya I already put it so nanti on the card ya I will just tell them to search my name ah
because when I search I dah try I signed out from YouTube and then I try searching my name just nice keluar everything mine right my account
tak I actually don't know how it works ah
I just for me pakai for me just use laptop camera can already but you awak yang nak
biar ah bukannya kita nampak it's the screen is going to be so small we're gonna be far away from the laptop
okay lor so it means you what you're trying to say is the camera tak payah like be connected to the laptop
eh besok awak kerja kan
mana tahu sometimes you go site you take a while what
entah lah
tapi fajr takut dengan mak dia mak dia marah dia diam dia ni tak dia ni jawab balik
cannot ah mesti have to dorang nak kena takut takut they need to know the consequences of their wrongdoing macam zurai tak pukul langsung
ya lah ya pukul just to dorang rasa dia punya pahit ah macam ow
nak kena sakit sikit jer
I I tengok terus I tertidur
tapi ya lah like let's same ah like my my brothers can do whatever they want perempuan aje like the rules only ya because they're they're guys ya the rules only apply to girls guys ya lah dorang lelaki nanti dorang selalu cakap ah biar ah dorang lelaki
it's it's the it's the same concept as the westerners ah like when the girl have sex a lot she's considered a slut but when the guy have sex a lot they're considered macam wow a man ya tu ah
or is it it comes from the western ah so orang tengok macam gitu kan
the children the the children will tengok at how their parents are ah nanti kalau dorang nampak dorang macam dorang nampak macam if let's say dorang nampak the father kurang ajar dengan mak dia nanti they also know they will do that to the girls also
it's no lah sometimes it's not about the father also sometimes because sekarang perempuan semua they want to be feminists ya that's also the problem ya perempuan perempuan wants the same status and rank as the guy so macam ya sekarang wives apa
tapi women now don't want to show that women need men
ya sekarang susah
I think it's okay it's okay kalau women want to be independent but ya but at least show lah kasi like give and take
tak sayang ah tu
ya they don't have time to dia you know you know I saw I read something like I think we should do it lah when we get married dia cakap tak I read somewhere it's macam an advice dia cakap how to keep your marriage alive or macam not there dia cakap make sure once a week at least once a week you go out go for a dinner a'ah then at least once a month go for a staycation or something once a month macam go for like like a someone further away somewhere further
tak okay okay okay once once a week go out with your family together with your kids once a month have a one to one date a'ah lepas tu once a year go overseas with the with the whole family this is how you keep ya ya so at least walaupun like you have children once a month you are having dates so every once a month if if any time between the first month and the second month your your love macam die sikit ah you will macam you will refresh your dating days a'ah so at least every once a month every once a month you are lighting up the candle you're lighting up the candle ah so at least diam eh ya so that so I think it's a very good advice seh macam I think ya it's it's it ya cause the thing is sekarang a lot of people
but ya but when things happen dah susah
tak lah don't have to be tak don't have to macam go out macam overseas as in pergi dekat dekat pun tak kesah macam malaysia you know that kind of thing ya just somewhere lah
ya it's about macam kita macam keluar once a week bring your children out is macam gi bawah main-main ke a'ah just macam every sunday ya so macam picnic ke bring your own food ah pastu macam bila dating pun tak suruh pergi mana-mana mahal macam just go out dating jer huh ya just go out like apa
ya that is the daily that's the daily punya cure ah tapi susah because I think everyone is working tapi dorang cakap kan dorang cakap kalau let's say suami dia actually dah solat abeh bini dia nak solat suami tu boleh solat lagi just to imamkan dia something like that kan macam let's say kalau wife wife dia dah solat sekali lelaki dia datang
ah lepas tu lelaki let's say the husband datang balik balik dari kerja it's okay that the wife solat lagi dengan dia just so ah suami dia macam just boleh solat jemaah lah with the wife
nanti balik ah imamkan
sekarang ya the thing is sekarang cakap senang nanti mesti ada dugaan dia bisikan syaitan tak payah lah tak payah solat jemaah pergi solat sendiri-sendiri sudah dah apa ayah why you never pray what time already siapa anak siapa anak syafiq eh ayah what time already
tak lah dengan mak bapa dia dorang sendiri-sendiri dengan awak jer dengan kita jer nak solat dengan kita tapi dorang kat rumah sendiri-sendiri
I definitely eat rendang
rendang actually that's a good question why tau because
I selalu makan rendang
hari raya but then mak mak
mak always masak like anytime she wants
so when she everytime masak I everytime makan and I love the taste of rendang
so I makan everyday ah
dua bulan makan rendang straight
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe petang makan with roti then malam makan dengan noodle

you put serunding oof

kirakan the big shot ah
people yang ego
so macam
I just can't stand kalau orang nak macam nak step besar ah nak step orang yang nak step I really just cannot
kirakan dia champion ah kirakan dia champion
more better lebih baik
then hidup tak ada objective
tak ada makna ya because for example if someone
work in terms of because orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu
ya so macam
ah so macam buang masa ah hidup
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed banyak banyak industry he dah masuk he fail banyak

word of the day penat
it's very macam
asal kerja merepek seh

you know like very like feminine punya bags
apa seh I thought I want to like

I want to buy ah like I don't mind macam we kumpul duit then we buy like macam expensive like Coach or what you know like something a bit more pricey like more quality kan then how ah or maybe I should ask them ah but I haven't like ask them you know

and then she bring food lah and then she always lepak and she she gossip under the block
with the with the rest of the mak cik mak cik
bapa no no no
yes you know I pun my kindergarten was there
but anyway ya nenek always lepak there
no bawah block
ada lah inside
anyways nenek always lepak under the block and then at there at the at the primary school right always got uncle apa tu ice cream uncle
cause our our nenek and our mum all sit together what
my nenek sit with all their mum and then after that we all come out
and then we go to them salam salam buy ice cream go and play
ya but then after nenek stop nenek stop

I whenever I hungry I take the botol botol susu then I ketuk my apa tu abang noah punya kepala
like ketuk ketuk
ian very very very apa tu
energy banyak energy
err apa tu in primary school I was I was loud but then I was
in my own world in my own bubble you know shiok sendiri
and then apa tu in secondary school more people seem to like me so I talk more to them then I became the leader sort of mm
that's how I got into dikir what
err apa tu the whole cohort for dikir and dance
but then like ya lah macam how to say I wouldn't
cause okay I remember she she always tell me tell me this ah she will be like cause that recently she was like apa tu selalu bila kau nak beli makan kau selalu ulang ulang ulang
ah kau selalu apa tu
suruh nak benda yang sama so like for example she say uh I I say what you want to eat then she say I want to eat mi soto
then I wanted to eat ayam nasi ayam and then I was like okay let's eat mi soto then she was like go buy your own food
okay I miss telling you primary to primary five class his mother is known in school he the mother jual makanan
err and mi soto punya kuah
with the mi soto punya kuah it's really really nice
so first you get the porridge and then you put the kuah
really the bubur and the kuah sedap
we tell the mak cik
at first lah and then after that we started ordering it like huh and that shop sells apa tu fishball noodle
sells mi soto I forgot if got mi rebus and porridge bubur
my school got a lot of jelly and the apa tu the ice cream popsicle
find the western shop with the halal lah
one with the halal ada mac and cheese
gaduh ah why never gaduh
itu lah
itu jer
dah lah pakai tudung lepas tu lari lari kacau orang
he was picking on this other guy then that guy apa tu was starting to cry not cry lah he was like tearing up
no lah but he was just ah he's a very small kecil kecil pendek pendek
si kurap of course I didn't say lah
sweet nya
that's great sorry uh I didn't hear you just now you were saying uh you buat apa sekarang
oh eh ah ah eh like why why would you participate kalau you indonesian sorry
indonesian I see uh freelance tu kat mana
like how how do you find the freelance job macam mana
oh that's that's great because um actually macam kalau I pun tengah cari-cari kerja lah sebab um recently I just quit my job because of ya ya because of some um apa kesihatan ah related to kesihatan um ethics so macam I not quit lah I taking a break so but I tak tahu I nak continue ke tak
ya so I'm I'm looking for jobs to so macam that's interesting um maybe I can like to try to look uh look for this kind of jobs too
ah ah like I I feel like I woke up everyday like macam rasa tak happy gitu seh like nak pergi kerja alamak
hmm so like uh as of now I I tak tahu if like it's not my passion or like it's not it's not my rezeki or what because I really feel like uh I used to really passionate about this tapi macam sekarang macam dah malas nak pergi then macam really tak tahu lah if I should continue or not but like now I'm taking like maybe two months break
oh okay so what like sekarang like what line you you at like uh what industry
ya but I pun macam not really um into it yet macam how how do I say it macam dulu I
baru jer baru jer because
ya I baru graduate uh last year as in actually this year lah the apa tu during the period actually suppose to have our um ceremony kan tapi tak boleh ya so I'm the unlucky batch
ya um ya so um I I got into an internship dia ajar bukan ajar lah tapi macam it's speech and drama so I um my course actually applied drama and psychology uh so macam my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they macam post me to uh this early childhood not early childhood lah tapi macam like somewhat macam budak-budak dia macam actually interested uh tapi I got confuse I think I more interested in the uh in the drama side instead of teaching budak-budak
when I was in internship oh uh so pagi kita okay uh so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so pagi uh tak ada apa-apa it's just admin job then the admin job pun macam like tak susah sangat lah I mean like it was difficult because halfway kita punya supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in uh the company because of some things happen uh then uh so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang for class kan then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just uh tolong the teacher to just hype the class nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap something funny then we're just like uh apa tu oh my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing lah macam stupid gitu tapi macam
ya it's like to encourage them to macam speak up macam do do the drama with them macam we will have like um dramas uh drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
ya so like now I tak tahu if I nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
um actually it's not like allow allow not like dia orang suka-suka nak allow but it's like um it's a bit unethical for me to work there also lah because like err I've been having macam low moods and stuff so macam kesian the budak-budak lah
hmm I honestly tak tahu seh because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so macam I I tak tahu if it's because of my um my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm um but I I came clean to my boss like I bilang dia uh whatever that's been happening in my life then she say lah macam uh I don't think you're you're capable of working now so macam I need to macam set my head straight lah uh maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel macam hundred percent here lah because like right now you're a like everywhere
and that's a big decision to make seh because like um it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then macam in the future like kalau lambat then you it's hard for you to change but now macam is the time um for us to macam explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
ah tu lah
ya unless kalau kita kerja part time yang macam um temperature taking gitu semua I mean it's it's okay lah macam good ya it's better than nothing tapi macam the thing is ah I'm just worried macam this is just macam just graduate kan so macam I think too much about stuff then um if I take that kind of job now then macam I don't have like much experience in like uh what I want to do in the future dia macam I scared macam I'm not prepared lah but this is just me overthinking lah but um if dapat dapat kerja the temperature taking pun macam bersyukur seh as of now
berapa lama the the webinar
wow that's really good because like actually um when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to macam a diploma conversion ya so but then um for now obviously cannot uh go to the school lah the tapi nanti if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so macam um I I don't know I feel like macam its a bit more demanding in a way macam and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit macam focused on like just real school
oh no uh it's not uh teaching the kids at home but err apa itu it's just like normal school macam we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning baru kita teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two um one we teach the kids at school real kids then balik then err the teacher that lecturer will teach us pula on like about kid
um honestly I feel like a bit macam I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet kan macam I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class tapi um from what I think ah macam it depends on the company you work with kalau the company macam give you a lot of uh things to do like homework macam preparing worksheets for the kids tu semua they don't have like a proper system like tak ada macam mana eh they tak ada their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so macam it's that already a a lot of workload then kita pergi sekolah we have also we also have our assignment and like test tu semua ya so it's like it's a bit macam scary kan
ya I feel I felt that way lah then macam that's why I felt really macam um I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown semua
um I think they because there's only one that just uh finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said macam is going to be difficult lah sebab um the tempat kerja even weekend sometimes the boss I think macam she didn't like intentionally do this tapi macam just to macam she will like text us during the weekends macam to tell us need to do this this this so macam um my colleague yang just finish the diploma dia cakap ah it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then macam we we also have the our stuff to do so macam she she felt like it's a bit difficult lah to go through
that so macam she she was concerned about me lah because like she she knew that uh it's going to be tough for me and especially now kan um that's not enough teacher the card the company so so macam there's a lot of macam pressure on on the new teachers macam kita not teachers lah macam supposedly I'm not supposed to teach kan so macam they try their best not to macam expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper tapi macam sometimes nak tak nak macam takkan lah nak biarkan the company to drown kan like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya macam that's why macam she say it will be early will be more tough on me lah because everything is new then nak kena belajar nak kena adapt to the changes then like uh nak kena apa belajar lagi
but then like okay so why why macam I'm stressing myself kan like I agree with you macam since since secondary school I already told myself macam kalau tak happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then um but then now kan macam I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone lah tapi macam I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then macam I takut because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre tapi kat singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this nak buat theatre macam mana kan like there's no audience but I know there's some like macam virtual and stuff but then macam virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously err you it's easier for you to um
uh to stay there lah macam to continue from where you are tapi macam kalau you are not in the theatre company then macam susah nak dapat nak ada audition pun tak ada
early childhood um the thing is like for early childhood kan macam I tak ada um much experience other than my internship internship ya so err I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like um there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is err is err the company itself yang I am in right now is actually macam they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that um she tak ini ah tak expect us to stay very long she just uh provide a platform for a like a stepping stone gitu so macam she she encourages people to ya she macam looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing macam I know deep down that I am interested in theatre lah to I want to macam act again and stuff tapi macam I know in singapore tak boleh kan so much that's the pressure lah ya I want to do theatre tapi macam I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
uh for like kalau I nak buat early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then macam and early childhood is not bad the the pay kan especially in singapore because they need people but then like um and like if I don't continue for early childhood I macam I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit lah honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like macam average lah tapi jap eh my mum my mum is like texting me
that's that's sweet because like my mom dia macam passive aggressive tak tahu nak cakap macam mana it's like ya she macam I um because dari kecil we don't really macam um not very affectionate we are macam okay ya so macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia a bit awkward macam nak open up pun a bit awkward
then macam every time macam dari kecil I nangis about like oh my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so macam like she taught me to be tough lah macam like err emotions she put away emotions tu so macam sekarang I sedih I marah or like anything lah then I cannot like go to her to talk about things lah then macam I try my best walaupun dia macam push or try to avoid the emotion kan I will just like
try my best to explain to her lah macam what I'm feeling this way because this this this tapi then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I cakap face to face she will macam like um suddenly become very cold then macam don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things macam err err if you cannot do it then I cannot force you macam that kind of stuff you know so macam I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not macam put any pressure on me but macam that itself already made me err pressurize ya
huh err err I I have seniors but then macam I don't really talk to them macam I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there macam I don't want to stop ya
ya so macam I go for the safest uh option first which is the early childhood lah then macam but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it tapi macam kalau I nak go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then macam
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off lah I would I would say so macam if like I don't have any this is just me lah err if I don't have any macam um any education or like any specific job in mind I scared macam like not good enough you know this is kan
ya so um ya lah so macam uh as of now he keep on saying macam don't worry don't worry tapi macam you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like um that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
mm mm ya so like sekarang I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing lah because um it was a hard decision for me to make to like uh stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company um not preparing any anything for them macam macam very abruptly lah the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague yang ah the one that just went through the conversion she macam very quite helpful lah she macam keep on saying oh it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat err ya we teaching the we we you macam assisting the same class
hmm hmm but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting um the the same level kan so macam I was err more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so macam uh craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare tu semua kan
then like um the the thing is they they have this thing in the company macam kalau craft teacher dengan language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that err idea so macam most of the time I was doing the craft then macam balik pun I buat craft weekends pun I buat craft so macam like it was really a lot of stress for me lah ya then err macam I macam I that point of time geram dengan dia lah macam uh dia keep on saying macam oh I'll do it I'll do it tapi end up tak buat so I macam pressured lah because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson kan macam the one
ya so macam it was really really irritating then sampai like um the colleagues uh ah my other colleagues we very small company lah so macam they they saw me struggling gitu macam everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then err I my contract pula my timing ends at one thirty ah but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty gitu tapi my my timing kan I'm always there until four until three so macam
no no that's that's the thing so the company macam we already say in the contract so macam it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so macam ya that sucks lah that's macam that's why I feel like macam kalau I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm rabak
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so um if you have a diploma already but then you want to to macam decided to go for early childhood industry kan so you can apply at an at and then err and will consider ah macam but most of the time they will they will accept you ah because macam tak banyak in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya tak I don't think is lah because like um it this is there's a stereotype of like err early childhood teachers gets a lot of because um there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that tak banyak in singapore nak buat
then um if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say lah the company wants to sponsor you then um they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so macam diploma tu semua macam uh your O level english tu semua and then err they will contact you lah eh but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and um october
uh I right now I don't know if I want to continue lah because like after talking to you then macam like really make me realize macam ya I should just macam do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
um that's that's good but then like um that's I used to have savings um before before joining the company kan and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop rosak so I decided to buy a new laptop lah so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then macam the laptop won't be so much lah and I also look for a cheap laptop not like macam one thousand plus gitu ah
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then um after I got the laptop so macam my savings to terjejas like affected already then then like err when I join the company then I got the pay already right then macam okay lah my first pay so macam I belanja my my family to eat tu semua then like my boyfriend leaving so macam I help him with um err not help him macam like I give him as a gift to semua macam barang-barang for but not everything lah within just a few then macam I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like um broke macam mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like um I I didn't expect things to happen then macam my savings pun now like terjejas my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then macam I really feel macam everything is just
it's just cubaan now lah
ya but like I like mention ah I tak tahu if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my err my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
um so but a bit too macam you know so that people don't just terminate contracts suka hati ya so but I I brought it up to her lah about my situation tu semua but she quite understanding she say macam the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality lah it's not really macam to force to force you to pay or what
so macam she just macam let err let me uh apa tu not pay it eh not pay her and just macam take a break first but like err she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her lah but then macam as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her lah because really make
err I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time macam I feel the guilt lah because I told her that I want to continue working but like um I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that lah honestly because like at that point of time I really you macam have a lot in mind so macam I tell her stuff that I macam regret now
I I don't know why I as of now I really macam feel like everything is err falling apart lah because um ya lah because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then um my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just tapi macam I had a past of like my err my father's death so macam it kind of like triggered me lah just macam ya that's what I'm thinking so like um he him leaving my changes trigger everything lah so err I'm feeling like really really macam at my lowest right now lah ya so macam I feel sekarang
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why macam I'm supposed to take a break during tapi macam my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working macam why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then macam I need to macam ya so macam I don't know I'm really lost right now lah so I'm trying my best to macam look for freelance work from home kind of thing
and segan kind also ya understood
okay is it is it the connection the the wifi but I think my wifi ada something wrong gitu cause macam I can but then macam like very dubbing
then ya lah I I I understand why what you mean by macam um you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really I'm shy because I mean I'm in I'm from drama so I'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is um I overthink a lot lah so macam when people macam just hesitant to say something then I will straightaway think oh I'm asking too much and like I'm troubling her or him macam I will start to to question myself lah macam like am I am I like menyusahkan or not that kind of things that's why like I don't really wanna talk not because like um I ya lah sombong or what but ya I I think it's it will be great talking to someone err especially like someone that I don't know so macam I don't really have macam anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then macam ya
ya I I think it will help definitely sikit ke banyak still help thank you so much but I just want I just want to say that I I'm really like amazed at how macam you're doing it for your own good it's like you you boleh make that decision you know of like um taking a break and like exploring new things like I I don't know if I were ever have the courage to do that
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I masih macam like in the past as they have this macam um want to like put uh put some into my savings so like now macam even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so macam oh but oh my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just macam nak lepaskan anger gitu because like I'm so annoyed because err so this month punya pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so macam every time this month it's just very unlucky for me lah I got food poisoning lah I got like macam selesema lah because there has been like cold uh cold bug around the school so err then I got it also then I also macam ada panic attack in one of the night because I ingat I injured my neck so macam this month I took a lot of thinking that macam you can like I can claim from their lah then rupanya they cut cut it off from my from my gaji then because like err I still macam baru kerja situ it's still not three months yet something like that lah so macam they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard macam from my I'm not I don't know lah I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so macam and that's why I thought macam um we I already macam can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day baru like I she mentioned ah about macam oh I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so macam uh
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so macam macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu kan
err ya lah doesn't tapi sekarang macam I just feel a lot of guilt err towards the company so macam I tak tahu if I want to bring it up or not ah because err then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then macam they cutting from my gaji kan so macam I already had in mind okay my gaji month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I uh apa tu when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they rupanya they will like macam will not get a refund if I apa tu err discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred gitu so macam my gaji dah kurang then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay kan obviously the company won't ask won't macam want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then macam aduh sedih gila seh
like like I said lah that's why macam I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life um because like money wise then macam like um my boyfriend left for rasa macam got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really lah what's the everything is just falling apart
I have kakak but then like she she move out already because she nikah
hmm two actually but um my I'm not close to my eldest one because uh she we lain mak
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like um that won't bring that I won't bring it back home macam buat kerja kat situ then balik tak buat apa-apa
macam kalau penat penat kat kerja jer
I mean other than like there's um part time like macam F&B gitu lah guess can can do that tapi macam I don't know I kind of I'm not um I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think macam I can uh I can stay in can do that kind of part time but macam if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
organization so they are actually under macam they are more they work more with community instead of err kan kalau like you are the patient kan ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee lah macam like you just macam go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then um macam they will tell you lah or you you might need macam counselling or what then macam they will refer you to them lah me err I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy ah I'm not so sure about that but then macam um because yesterday when they told me about the the err what I can do next then macam rate of like err what the next thing then we just counselling lah macam is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
err I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't macam mana eh don't really ah take you no cannot ya
apa seh

I think I like documentaries my favourite cause I like to know facts or like uh know what's going on it is seram but that's that's um
true kita ikut apa yang kita nampak
selama-lamanya satu makanan yang awak boleh pilih and makanan itu akan bersama awak sampai akhir hayat
saya ada dua choice
ya with daging kita boleh buat banyak kita boleh buat banyak uh lauk
macam have itself
okay lah awak pilih satu lepas tu kita share
kifarah like you get what you get
walaupun kita rasa kita buat banyak baik but mesti ada satu kejadian
yang awak tak akan lupa mungkin awak rasa macam oh saya tak saya nampak auntie ni
tengah crossing the road tapi saya tak tolong sebab
so awak rasa awak utamakan muka yang cantik
atau awak lebih suka cergas like you know kadang-kadang kita nak keluar kita
okay kita makeup kita get ready
tak boleh fit in our pants you know we wear shirts and we're like we have to cover up properly cause
badan sihat why any reason
you know I tak boleh masak and then when I balik kerja I macam um

biarkan dia buat kerja dia sendiri and I don't think having good looks would help with doing all those chores you know
mmhmm bila awak rasa nak makan awak makan
complete with whatever we have kita tak rasa macam
at this age um aku rasa I'm doing just nice I'm doing fine or um at this age I'm doing okay you know I'm not that bad cause I'm still working or I'm still earning you know
we're talking about the cake jadi asal dengan cake tadi
ya I saw the picture then after that you terus tukar daripada gambar jadi message from gambar then it become a message that is where saya macam
so that that was the part when I actually eh ah you ask you ask me cake because you didn't mention macaron lagi so it was just cake
but I I didn't know the the macaron was choose a'ah sebab tu saya tanya
but she didn't say what oh it's a mix eh macaron dia mix colour jer ah
is it oh you can choose different like I I I I don't eat macarons always so saya a bit lost
tapi flavour no no no awak macam banyak-banyak flavour does it incur cost ataupun sama jer harga
oh okay I thought macam
oh it's not like semua satu satu satu macam err what you call it alternate macam selang-seli ah tak eh okay okay
mana dapat contact
orh abeh dia punya review is good
so the cake tak sedap ah
abeh the thing is kita tak boleh try dulu ke abeh macam gini a bit
oh by right kita boleh datang and taste correct so kalau kalau kita order sikit dia tak they don't sell macam kek tu a small portion that we can buy and taste
inshaa allah lah takde apa-apa lah can lah
so that is cake that is done dah habis
huh I don't apa yang two hour frame err saya tak faham
two hour time frame I think in advanced for them to get there I think oh okay I think I saya rasa they need to get there dorang nak kena stack up nak kena susun they need two hours for it to get ready so that means dalam macam they need to be there by six or something like that by seven they need to do the susun ah that's why they need two hours just in case tak it's a buffer time
okay ah I I could be right betul saya rasa ada chance betul
but because usually cake tak akan datang terus dah diri gitu they need to susun letak and then they macam ah tu lah a'ah ah mmhmm
cause I saw the message your mum macam nanti letak something decoration or something like that apa tu dia nak apa
dia nak apa your mum nak suruh macam jangan plain gitu ah so ada ada decoration
biar lah by the way tadi nabil call call you first eh dia call you first is it

I just say like macam takde lah apa yang susah sangat engkau cuma cakap okay sekarang sudah mah that's why saya cakap senang jer kau announce macam sekarang sudah masuk waktu azan dah lepas tu kau cakap okay sekarang kita nak akad nikah ah boleh ramai-ramai duduk gitu jer bukan kau suruh suruh berbual-bual interact takde I told him no you don't have to do that you just need to talk bila benda dia nak jadi kau bilang just inform jadi orang macam uh takpe takpe takpe takpe aku nak berbual pasal hakimmah ngan kau I macam merepek you know lah him you know lah him he always likes to macam kacau-kacau takpe takpe aku ada aku
a'ah dia abeh dia kata aku make sure hafiz S pun kena get involved I don't know biar biar jangan lepas tu then he said jangan jangan dia menggigil sudah
tapi I think yang yang yang pasal sound system I don't know they allow us to touch or not sometimes ada orang tak pasal dia dia ya sometimes they they don't allow you to touch you know
usually they don't allow to touch ah tapi kalau kita tahu
I think provided kalau takde event before that that means we can come early tau macam pasal slot before us is kosong uh
so okay lah maybe macam cake semua boleh set up siang kalau kalau let's say uh grab time
syafiq dengan rahmat um kalau ada kereta boleh lah dorang tengokkan kalau tak siapa lagi seh tengok rahmat is a actually syafiq dengan rahmat boleh lah syafiq boleh ambil awak atau rahmat can just stay there
ya but the plan is sekarang kakak cakap amirul will take care dengan bapa semua jadi itu part so kita kita focus on our side jer
that's why I think I set up saya pakai kat situ juga so that means
tu lah okay
boleh lah as in kita I don't know how is the rule I don't know macam mana kan semua
ya lah correct that means baru saya datang from home kat situ pula ya ya ya a'ah
so that means I tak macam gini tau you can pakai baju kat situ tau eh actually dah boleh pakai baju makeup yang pakai kat sana
makeup oh kira dah kat sana juga eh like that
kalau kalau tidak I I don't know for my side ada pak andam ke tidak ah ataupun pakai macam mana pakaian so kalau tidak
it's that atau I get is isn't it groom
from what I know eh kadang tak ada pak andam uh usually they will show mungkin kalau kalau groom tu nanti they will show the groom atau someone who's gonna be close to me how to wear it kalau dia boleh catch up boleh pick up then tak payah so after that dia pakaikan kalau tidak then that means nak kena get kakak punya kawan tu ah yang siapa I don't know georgie ke sofian I think that that's the name something like that that guy boleh buat dia memang a'ah
eh uh kalau rizal ada
eh uh kalau rizal ada okay ah tak the thing is dia nak kena ada orang yang tahu kalau ada orang tahu senang kalau takde nanti eh macam mana nak pakai ah pasal dia nak kena ikat
tak tahu I think tak lah actually the best tapi the best is belajar dulu
tak the thing is you need to teach who kalau teach sendiri saya boleh buat sendiri it's simple as that tapi dia nak kena pin kan ikat kan
that's why just just need to learn jer everything on YouTube most sekarang correct
oh malay dance ajar ikat kain eh
okay anyway tadi kita tulis
tak actually dia simple jer dia ikatkan sekejap jer dia ikatkan tu jer tak payah pegang apa-apa dia ikat tu dah then I can go off already I don't know nak kena pakai makeup I don't need to wear makeup pe kan
ada orang macam eh touch up touch up okay wait sabar are you going to put inai
lelaki tak payah lah tak perlu kalau tak nak boleh

a'ah I think they will serve on the table already this nanti dorang dah habis terus dia duduk
okay maybe maybe kita kasi dorang makan I think pun tak makan lama pun setengah twenty minutes then after that orang kasi makan macam twenty minutes kita pun makan kita makan orang makan jadi kita semua makan ah jadi jadi ya lah that's why I say kita makan dorang makan dah makan terus ambil gambar ambil gambar baru kita potong kek last last part macam gitu

okay from what I know ah eh macam venue gini kalau awak tak ada emcee dia err takde emcee usually what what usually kalau awak engage emcee there will be a the emcee it's either he can control ah ya lah this is what I know lah ataupun you will use your own relative to control the mic ah that's what they allow mm mm mm mm
okay actually kalau dia set setakat untuk berbual pe set kan untuk berbual just fade up fade down jer pe pelan-pelan jer tak payah kuat-kuat kita lima puluh orang lagu-lagu ah ya lah correct
play the song ah fade up lagu sikit mmhmm
a'ah boleh
tak tahu apa board
oo yang Yamaha kecil punya berapa
should be lah that one tak kan besar oh wait dia dia masukkan dekat sound board oh okay okay I saw already I saw the speaker on a yang okay speaker dia boleh tahan enough lah to cover then the board jer saya tak nampak okay lah takpe lah
lagu jer I think tak payah main kuat-kuat then the the list of song actually I have a few songs ah
standard lah qasidah-qasidah relax relax I think before that saya saya actually tengah tunggu nak maghrib tu saya saya nak tunggu maghrib tu saya nak suruh ustaz hakeem err kalau ustaz hakeem datang ah I just want him to recite a few qasidah tengah tunggu recite qasidah tapi takut dia paiseh dia sorang mm mm
a'ah sebelum nikah so sambil sambil tunggu tu qasidah sikit baca doa tapi boleh ah I think can do doa selamat while waiting pasal nanti bukan doa selamat ah baca zikir ustaz hakeem memang sorang pun dia power tapi kalau ustaz hakeem pegang mic tak kesah dulu dia okay tapi selalunya ustaz hakeem kalau pegang mic ah wahab dah start godeh board that's what I know kalau ustaz hakeem masuk jer dia godeh board
mm tak usually kalau kalau wahab dah godeh board correct correct usually wahab kalau godeh board dia will do as in general jer enough kalau uh ustaz hakeem dia adakan echo lah but it takes a while pe to get it kita tengok macam mana lah tapi
usually I think ustaz boleh baca qasidah sikit ke atau berzikir I think actually okay usually he likes to do that lah it would be nice jadi tak nervous sangat aku terima nikahnya aku terima nikah
firdaus hari-hari seh sekarang jumpa aku jumpa like he keep saying aku terima aku terima dia keep saying dia dia pasal dia nya dah nak dekat
tak dia tak stressful dia kata just sekarang ingat jer ah macam main-main main-main ah just main-main the with the thing jadi bila on the day dah macam kat lidah pe just hujung hujung aku terima nikah nama nama nama dengannya okay pasal that's how you practise you just keep saying it as in as in it's normal lama lama terus okay like that

okay okay kalau kalau kalau betul your mum nak beli do your own ada time tak kalau kalau
tak pasal kelmarin kakak already told me yang dia tu pernah buat I saw yang dulang kakak punya ah dorang they
is it I don't know kita tak I don't know
kita belum discuss pe pasal dulang
ya takpe lah tu that one can discuss later lah for this one
jap eh
oh ya know not yang firdaus punya venue he said he told me eh aku venue yes dia buat tiga ratus
pasal ah tapi dia cakap fifty by fifty that's why I said saya cakap kita punya tak boleh dia kata pasal shah ibrahim was daring enough to
ya lah fifty at one time so that means somehow pasal I think most of the venue don't want to take the risk fifty fifty fifty pun still the same people pe keep coming kan so I think most venue don't want they just do fifty jer so I think shah ibrahim somehow
but but because that time tak silap saya dia cakap adik eh mak dia pergi maknya firdaus ni went for the wedding one of the cousin wedding it already happening lah shah ibrahim allow macam said ah uh the mum saw dia punya invite is I think about a few hundred so ada orang ambassador eh no I think orang or ambassador is down there to uh overlook kat depan ah he standing in front ah ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct I think that's I think that's how he managed to convince them ah as in okay you can see at how we provide lah I think that's the procedure macam gitu
dia datang mmhmm mmhmm tapi memang
itu I told him I saya tanya firdaus dah habis kau pak saudara-mara kau pun yang jaga tak [ah] I think he will
dia pakai mesin tu pe remember that thing
abeh kita nak kena kita nak kena submit name eh
for us to make ah because we know oh no pasal kita tahu pe who are our guests dah itu jer
fifty people okay lah considered as our guest list ah but for us also our part is to just record lah nama kalau apa-apa jadi pun just pump kasi nama jer correct who are coming we just record itu ah itu jer correct
no of course not siapa nak subscribe
that's why then asal tak pakai awak punya
I know I remember but just I was I was doing I was writing down something dah
tripod small tripod stand small tau very small kecil punya kecil betul-betul kecil for the cam ah kan ada dia ada yang
use the same wi-fi to sync I don't know need to try I I I need to google I need to do a bit of research I don't know need to check cause from what I saw yesterday was using but then probably boleh pakai on by wi-fi kalau by wi-fi that means boleh gerak orang just hold dekat jer anyway it's really small kecil gila so it's easy ah to hold it kalau tidak orang pakai chest pack ah
tak pasal you have to face it have to face that's why dia punya screen face us macam very awkward awkward lah you have to see yourself I don't want
that now but like abeh laptop dia the thing is the laptop is big you have to keep shifting around orang leceh seh nak pegang kalau benda tu kecil dia boleh pegang pakai tangan and then just turn left right turn left right jer which is more better rather than you shift the whole screen every time just to adjust angle
work from home and then besok I got one site pukul tiga
tak ah sekejap jer pergi site
saya saya pergi site survey that's it takde pergi office
ya lah about one hour nya tempat pasal ni bukan really pasal dia macam just resurvey kita dah ada barang tu just need to shift it somewhere a proper location like in another location ah mm mmhmm
ya ya should be sempat lah it cannot be that long
sama macam fajr juga I think it's just a stage where
tak pasal tangan mak kakak I think tangan terus pump jadi tahu I think you can never spare the kid
mm tapi bukan
I think bukan pukul sampai sakit pukul just to ah
ah even even even macam just just to macam sepak pakai tangan pun macam just like that just dia tahu dia eh kena jadi dia tahu eh sakit okay so stop a'ah lah mm bukan sampai lah dera banting takde lah not like that
anyway tadi yang the video I send to you was too long
oh that's why you said it was too long but but actually it's quite good lah it it gives macam ustaz tu used to I went I used to went for his classes last time
ustaz madarrus he used to be in singapore now he's I think at mmhmm mm so I went for his classes last time ada cerita juga lah cerita dia so anyway he's quite good honestly kalau tanya saya baik so the the sister ask you saw the question right the sister ask about men
not being good leaders that kind of thing ah and then he he agree to it lah and then he explained why maybe the reason why things happen men nowadays boys nowadays doesn't turn out to be macam have a leadership have leadership ah responsibility like old people dorang kan ada responsibility it's just that nowadays we are okay ah simply put I also understand ah dia cakap macam nowadays err parents okay macam dia cakap parents usually perempuan takpe tak boleh balik lambat perempuan very strict semua tak boleh ya dia macam partly part
exactly pasal dorang apply to girls that's why tu dia cakap and then
mm then yang itu that's the problem pasal I think believe dulu orang kampung macam macam mana pun nanti kalau orang-orang lama pun ah nanti macam mana pun they will still start teaching the boys to tak responsibility kau nak kena jaga adik kau macam gitu
macam wah bagus pe kau bagus macam the the the biasness eh biasness
tak tahu ah I think sekarang happening to us is the modern and then we are too exposed dengan
ya lah western it's come from western that's why dulu orang kampung dia cakap budak-budak lelaki they they they become matured faster pasal the dad I I think the further the behind part they explain a lot of things ah macam it the mother also play a role dia kata macam not to strike not strike fear tau macam to gain respect for macam the mother hold the status of the father macam make the status among the the children they fear the father fear the father macam respect tau yes pasal dia cakap macam
mm abeh yes dia kata macam dulu orang cakap bapa balik jer tak payah bapa cakap balik nampak bapa balik takde tunggu straightaway masuk rumah punya bapa tak payah tenung pun dia step tak nampak jer automatically come home you know pasal automatically the father have this respect already abeh macam the mum dia kata hold this status macam okay ni bapa kau punya cawan kau jangan pegang macam ini pinggan bapa kau punya kau jangan makan dari bapa kau punya pinggan macam the mother so dia macam keep dia gitu tau so dia kata the father is the leader of the family and the mother is the leader of the household and children macam gitu so but overall it's still the father ah so dia kata nowadays even the father lack that macam I don't know what happened lah but then dia kata the fathers just lack lack
abeh dia kata yes ah tu ah he was talking about that also that was that one thing also
then then he said then he also mentioned mentioned this thing ah men have ego and men always wanted to be needed faham kan wants to be needed
yes that's the thing perempuan asyik I want I'm independent dia kata tak boleh the the rule of a man is to be needed kalau kau take away that he's not needed dia a very yes that's one thing ataupun dia punya ego mati nanti dia terus macam abeh dia kata that's why a lot people fall into depression pasal guy not needed women are independent dia cakap gitu that that's the tapi it's a this is the theory ah
dia kata ya
dia kata tak the thing is macam dia dia kata ada there was this one person who came up to me ustaz I'm married I have children and then I I don't have a problem but the main problem is my husband dia cakap gitu so actually I can earn my own money but I don't need him but I don't know why I'm married lepas tu ustaz tak boleh cakap apa-apa I don't know why I'm married macam I think it's just pasal no the thing is she is a woman tak bukan tak sayang I think over time dia ada children dia busy kerja they live too long together you get tired of the guy get tired of the guy something like that
okay wait kalau you have a kids that means you separate from your kids ah just the two of
the bond ah the bond together ah macam have adventures ah
develop again ah oh ya rekindle ah kira ada semangat membara balik
tak okay eh I think it's easy to say the thing is it's easy to say tau but then kalau awak tengok eh the context of singapore in the context of singapore susah you see eh sekarang jer to survive some you you look at the household lelaki bini nak kena
activity lah a'ah ya correct tak payah spend money ya just to macam cycling I can yes yes mmhmm mm
tetapi kan mm tapi still and then macam this kind of thing is one of the thing tapi macam dalam every day tu macam kalau boleh macam dapat solat jemaah macam malam together that would be ya that that how the ya that that's how you ah mmhmm that's like how to
ya lah nowadays ya lah tapi mak cakap
ya boleh boleh tak salah a'ah boleh memang boleh macam saya solat jemaah kat masjid mm
mm can ah ya boleh kan dah cakap macam suami nak gi dia suka sembahyang jemaah kat masjid so just go solat masjid jemaah balik dia imamkan isteri lagi ah boleh no nothing wrong with that pasal isteri have to do her chores abeh dia nak solat jemaah pe kesian kan solat lah bagus think this kind of thing can can can keep ourselves
a'ah lah tapi
tapi macam macam firuz mm macam firuz he likes to solat macam firuz is see so far lah firuz and amira like to solat jemaah so I think they don't want to solat sendiri-sendiri so which is good also lah
kadang-kadang firuz bawa solat tapi firuz punya al-fatihah good seh saya kadang-kadang macam eh you haven't pray ah you pray on your own first lepas tu saya dengarkan lah I correct him then it's okay
okay hari ini I went to bath and body works
I went to apa itu to err the dia punya outlet dekat takashimaya sebab I nak beli dia punya err scented candle
ya black friday hari ini
but it's very it's a very it's I'm very disappointed lah because dia punya sale kan
patutnya hari ini banyak um barang-barang kan tapi like semua macam sudah run out macam like the day before dia orang dia orang had a sale
tak best ah tahun ini tak best
you know I went to three one three then after that err tengok-tengok baju tapi so macam they say the price is lowered tapi macam it's still expensive you know
ya semua tempat pergi semua crowded
ya really and then tak payah keluar tak payah queue semua
just now um I was lucky lah because I thought they had this early bird sale and everything then I tunggu pukul sembilan pagi all the way till eleven plus masih belum buka
tak macam dia punya sale on black friday kan macam kaw kaw usually it's kaw kaw but this year macam it's so mellowed down
ya then like um malaysia punya lagi kaw dia orang punya black friday tapi I heard from my cousin dia orang punya black friday like no black friday
ya economy so bad already malaysia kasihan
same sudah lah murah
no not thai odyssey apa nama dia err no another one healthland
worth it sangat and then like kalau you pergi yang punya there are few outlets lah tapi the best one right you find the biggest outlet itu yang paling best
dia bukan spa it's totally all full thai massage
I pun tak ingat hundred and twenty minutes I sudah lama tak pergi nak dekat how many close to a year tak pergi
ya sedih ah
the pasar tani
ya no not normal pasar tau pasar tani
bukan pasar malam dia macam pasar pagi tapi tani lah like macam-macam lah you get like err avocado smoothie lah
then after that pineapple juice lah macam-macam ah I like
oh ah ah ya ya ya queue dia selalu panjang kan
then like kalau I masuk malaysia kan I selalu datang pagi like very very early then dia punya crowd tak sangat macam teruk sangat lah still manageable
kalau ya
ah ada lah
tak shops belum buka sebab I straightaway pergi pasar tani so I sudah sampai situ kan by the time I reach situ sudah six plus
then six plus tunggu kat pasar tani itu err I think about fifteen twenty minutes until dia punya set up semua sudah start then we go in ah
oh my favourite is avocado juice memang sedap
no um I also tak suka sayur tapi macam dia punya avocado juice is like the indonesian style dia macam campur gula melaka semua
ya it's nice dia manis yes
ya can memang sedap
yang dekat singapore punya you can try indonesian restaurants yang dekat I'm sure indonesian restaurant anywhere in singapore ada dia nama jus alpukat
ya tapi memang sedap if I have to choose a favourite drink that would be my favourite drink I really love avocado juice
tak ah I don't really like fruit fruit juice tapi like I don't know ah avocado is just an exception
malaysia yes I selalu pergi situ like staycation with my family over there tapi kalau staycation dekat singapore memang tak lah
ya and then might as well you duduk dekat rumah kan your own home
ya itu lah
yes is enough memang cukup uh sedih merana
I was like okay basically right I kalau tak pergi massage sudah berapa bulan kan my back will hurt so much
so I jenis macam how to say I'm very picky with my massage massage punya tempat tau I don't like indonesian style massage it's very painful
always yes tapi thai massage dekat singapore semua macam so expensive
ada eh
wah nak try ah
sebab indonesian punya uh style kan javanese style punya ya allah I bentan urat the urat the next day my whole body ache like mad kadang-kadang tak boleh bangun pun
yes it's very bad but ya but for thai massage kan I macam the next day more more active and boleh buat macam-macam
um I try both dua-dua I suka
I prefer the traditional one sebab dia dia push your body macam macam way then bunyi ketap-ketup wah
ya sedap
tapi you kena pergi yang macam err healthland lah that one professional and thai odyssey lah tapi jangan pergi yang um tepi-tepi jalan punya that one a bit scary ah
ah ah kaki
kan sedap
sudah habis ya me also
itu lah
err boleh cakap pasal err apa eh nama dia makanan favourite ke
oh pedas type sudah try mala
msla sedap
oh plain then you should try apa itu green curry
should try sedap sangat sedap
it's creamy and then after that dia ada macam a bit pedas-pedas then got manis like all the flavours ada lah in one
I tak tahu
oh oh yang tingkat bawah itu eh
lah I always thought itu tak halal so I always buy the drink sahaja aduh yes now I know oh my favourite thai green err thai my favourite thai drink is thai green milk tea

I always eat at this macam err outlet dekat mana eh dekat far east plaza I don't know if you know
huh uh dia tingkat bawah I don't know if you know cahaya cahaya tingkat atas tapi yang thai food ini all the way tingkat bawah dekat belakang
huh uh dia tingkat yang sama macam yang korean supermarket itu

yes I'm more of a cahaya fan tak tahu kenapa
preference ya err what I like from cahaya is the apa eh mushroom dried noodles itu mm sedap
oh sedapnya
ya I also aduh then dia punya wanton pun sedap but I haven't tried I haven't tried puncak one
why sedap eh
ya sebelah sebelah jer kan ya but then you also should try the downstairs one the thai food memang sedap
chey macam promoting dia punya tom yum I tak pernah rasa tapi I pernah rasa dia punya green curry dengan dia punya err pineapple fried rice these those are my favourite
okay I remember the sebab dia ada dua kedai thai err one is called nana
and then nana you just walk straight turn left sebelah dia sudah it's literally beside it it is called something something thai food
this kita hari kecil saja
oh kalau you datang pukul sebelas atau pukul dua belas memang ramai orang tak ada tempat duduk
so I suggest ya weekdays I suggest you datang pukul sepuluh and below lah
I think not so crowded tapi pukul sebelas I can guarantee you banyak orang
ya ya and it's like cheap affordable and memang sedap
cartoon network I suka tengok err apa itu masa zaman I kecil-kecil lah I like to watch scooby doo
then err captain caveman and apa eh road runner
err ya I love these three last time right masa I kecil-kecil pukul err lima pagi I macam ada schedule tau at five right I will watch captain caveman then after that scooby doo and then after that in the day I will watch road runner
stop watching it right ya me also ya same tapi right my love for scooby doo right is still there somehow
dia macam how to say ah dia sudah macam cari hantu
you know like dia macam cerita budak-budak kan jadi dia punya hantu semua merepek-meraban tak tak macam hantu betul
so like and then like you will try to figure out who is the culprit and everything dia macam put thinking skills in you tau
so like you fikir siapa agaknya culprit ini oh bukan ini then after that turns out it's orang ini so like that kind of thinking skills so that so that's the type I like lah
ya it's all ya dia orang acah-acah macam hantu
it's very funny then like I suka sangat scoody doo sampai beli dia punya err apa itu plush toy
no lah dia anjing apa scooby doo anjing so okay lah I just have it like for fun because it's like memory my favourite cartoon I'll have one lah
yang piglet itu ke
yay you know like masa I dekat indonesia indonesia kan macam tak banyak cartoon kan
so like at like in the middle of the night I suka buka so like in the middle of the night dia orang boleh main shaun the sheep ya and then I watch till the next morning then my mum macam bangun like eh you haven't sleep no I watch shaun the sheep the whole night night ya then that is how I like shaun the sheep is very funny
dia kejap eh hmm I think it was in indonesian
ya dia macam voice over gitu
ya I also pelik
ya ah ya ya dia punya mouth memang tak in sync and it's not satisfying
ya ya ya betul betul
then right you always go malaysia right you pernah nampak cartoon ini nama larva tak
dia larva bukan volcano tahu dia larva is err macam ulat
dekat mana I tak tahu location dia tapi I tahu dia punya mall nama capital
ya tapi dia punya tingkat atas is just an indoor theme park for the kids then dekat bawah semua normal shopping mall
boring tapi larva itu memang funny
okay I don't like but my mum seems to like it which is so pelik ya very pelik my favourite is oggy and the cockroaches
oh ya I mean I also geli dengan cockroaches but after watching that show kan macam I pandang cockroach macam it's the oggy the cockroaches ya ya then I outgrew that fear of cockroach already so ya cause I find them funny
yes ya tapi tapi kan I have a phobia for spiders
I tak boleh spiders I will see if the spider is like one meter away I will scream I just cannot see spider
ya I just cannot phobia sangat because what happened was last time when I was kecil kan err I don't know whether is it dream or it actually happened but I was inside a car then after that the whole car dalam interior of the car is filled with spiders
ya ya I don't know whether is it a nightmare or real because that happened when I was a kid so after that terus I phobia
I tak boleh tengok spider
aiyo I can feel you alamak kalau I pun phobia
aduh aduh kalau I pun phobia seh
ya and then like what triggers it more is that my parents left me sebab dia orang nak pergi beli barang sekejap
ya then my parents found me crying macam orang gila
err but I really don't know whether it actually happen or is it a bad dream itu saja
my parents cakap they never leave me in the car before itu yang pelik
sampai I boleh phobia macam ini
ya until now that time err masa I kecil I pergi school camp pun sama
bukan ada spider we literally set our err khemah on a grass a grassland filled with macam spider tanah
ya spiders tapi dia orang on the tanah so like malam-malam I felt something on me I nampak spider I menjerit I literally went hysterical
ya then I ran I ran to the err guard posts semua then after that it took me berapa jam ah to calm down can you imagine you phobia then you nampak that thing on you
phobia ya ya on top of it you know then bila ya exactly then bila um I pekik itu kan can you imagine I pekik pukul dua pagi everyone bangun then everyone nampak yang dia punya tent is infested with spiders
so can you imagine the kecoh
I I tak kisah I campak semua barang I ada kipas dekat situ I campak kipas I campak lamp post anything over there I campak I just ran masuk toilet and I literally drenched myself with water
then after that I keluar I lari pergi dia punya teacher's post
they calm me down dia orang kasih apa dia orang kasih makan milo semua then after that err sudah reda dia orang cakap eh what happen to you boleh tanya lagi what happen to me aduh then after that I explain lah then dia orang cakap oh patut lah kau hysterical yang lain semua okay sudah dia orang sudah move tempat lain sudah I saja yang hysterical sebab mmhmm spiders ya

uh huh tak percaya you tengok instagram dia
macam siao ting tong serious
itu satu and um dia macam artsy fartsy actually I don't know whether he's like the sudah gila ke err dia memang buat-buat macam gila because dia punya post pun macam pelik-pelik
I don't know how to explain to you tapi post dia memang pelik semua
right pelik kan
macam sudah a bit off
err bedsheet pun ada
then tahun lepas I pergi err dia punya making of the studio
dia punya official set punya tempat
okay um depends lah kalau you fan memang lah it's your heaven there tapi kalau you tak suka harry potter then don't waste your money there
tapi dia punya set ya allah besarnya
dia it's so big then I think it took us like four hours to finish the whole thing
ya ya ya then sudah lah jauh daripada london so basically we empat jam over there and then after that one hour pergi one hour balik
tapi it's best kalau you nak pergi kan you ambil set lah so there is a bus hantar you bus ambil you
macam mana nak kira duh
I pernah pergi
okay okay I tak nak boast lah
most I haven't gone to err eastern europe yet macam prague itu semua belum pergi
no I I have never been to myanmar tapi I um my grandma is burmese
my grandpa sudah sudah pass away sudah
it's like um I decided not to learn burmese but memang susah
uh huh very mixed lah this family ya best lah I mean dia macam ya lah tapi like my my mum malay lah of course but my grandmother dia kahwin dengan melayu
ya my atuk is good looking not boasting tapi when I look at him memang wah any woman akan suka dengan dia at that time
then after that dapat my mum so malay lah I
ya melayu melayu lah melayu boleh
eh tak ada lah
okay ah oh but walaupun um ada sedikit campur err dia punya err darah kan tapi I hold very strongly to uh hang tuah
dengan P ramlee
dia rumah betul dia tapi they convert to museum
ya then um for hang tuah I memang suka history and everything macam gitu lah
so ya I pergi perigi hang tuah
ya perigi hang tuah
oh because dia macam dia bukan attraction to public tahu jadi macam orang-orang yang macam singaporean yang biasa yang tak suka history dia orang tak akan tahu tempat itu kalau dia orang tak buat research
so like macam I memang suka like zaman-zaman dulu punya history kan so I like dig out lah then after that I felt oh hang tuah ah I should go
um the I don't know if you know the puteri gunung ledang
puteri gunung ledang is also another story
oh baru add eh
ya who doesn't watch bujang lapuk
but ya lah fun lah but I ini suka discover about all this malay malay punya history kan so I literally baca pasal puteri gunung ledang and I'm already intrigued
err I pergi library satu thing satu pasal then the other one is internet lor
okay reading itu depends on um what book it is
ah ah kalau you give me roald roald dahl is it called roald dahl
I tak akan baca
best ke
oh that one notebook punya orang kan
ya ya they were just jealous jealous sikit aduh ya that's why ya yay I found find a friends fan okay so basically kan um I boleh bangun nowadays ah I boleh bangun pukul lima and then I'll be like okay I'm bored I'm going to watch friends really
ya oh my god same you feel me yay err then masa I pergi itu kan I happened to go to primark primark suka ada macam themed err themed christmas style so they will sell all the themed punya barang-barang lah so I pergi to this err one of the primarks lah then I saw a friends collection
pullover ya macam jacket tak ada zip
ya ya ya memang cosy gila
kalau I kan I tak nak branded you just give me primark and I will be happy for life
sebab they have themed
they have themed accessories itu one thing the other thing is that it's murah
um of course lah there is a different sikit lah tapi dia macam tak melampau macam other other kind of brands lah
and it's still worth it because you tak akan jumpa primark dekat singapore
sudah lama pakai pun masih okay
you pernah tengok yang um monkey tak
I suka tengok
ya ya ya that one mantis sembahyang solat mantis
uh apa eh aku pun sudah lupa
aku sudah cakap solat mantis tengok lah ketawakan orang
mm kejap eh
I'm just gonna leave it as solat mantis
tapi yang paling kelakar is like when they interview the body parts punya ini apa ini apa aduh
ya dekat tampines
ya dekat tampines sister aduh
dekat tampines
ya I think kalau they interview me ah I hopefully will get like fifty
orang tak tahu apa gusi gusi is gum
I mean nervous pun macam gusi you don't know what is gusi
aduh and then there's one person cakap apa I don't have gusi
kelakar lah
I also don't like watch local youtube tapi because I like to um macam bab melayu-melayu ini I suka dengar orang macam tersasul ke apa kan so I suka tengok itu then laugh my lah lah you know
best ke
ya sudah tak ada sudah
I think the ya the last romance movie ah I tengok dekat cinema is apa eh crazy rich asians
go watch lah it's very nice tapi yang I tak suka is macam dia tak macam mix tau
macam dia punya portrayal of singapore macam very atas gitu
huh uh it's like nanti orang ingat semua kita kaya I have overseas friends dia orang ingat oh you crazy rich ah I macam I macam huh no aduh
sis literally if I have the money I will borong the store
you tahu tak dia punya macam dia macam jacket dia macam fur fur gitu
dia macam banyak-banyak colour tapi dia macam jacket and it's furry furry on the outside
tak pernah nampak eh
oh bukan yang hood punya dia tak ada hood
I bought it err okay last year masa I kerja I pergi rush pergi uniqlo I don't know why during my lunch break lepas itu I pergi capai itu oh my god it is like the best spend out of my pocket money
no lah I think it's about twenty dollars or ya twenty dollars lebih
uh ke I bought it in malaysia no lah I bought it in singapore
twenty to thirty dollars macam gitu ah
but what am I saying uniqlo punya baju semua comfortable
ya uniqlo punya memang really the best ah
tapi if you want to find like macam vintage vintage and oversized shirt kan cotton on is still the best though
okay I tak suka oversized shirt tapi depends kalau dia punya
dia punya how to say graphic dekat depan itu cantik then I will probably buy it
if macam tak cantik I tak akan beli lah
tapi honestly
banyak orang suka pergi thrift shopping
err lucky plaza banyak
I think you pergi yang tingkat atas atas punya
I can't believe you know baju champion yang our parents wear last time
can fetch up to fifty and above sekarang
oh okay um sekarang I'm doing like part time um kerja part time so macam um I do some um actually doing financial advisory um ya at the same time doing um freelance freelance works ah ya um macam and doing translation works for untuk bahasa melayu to and bahasa indonesia ya
ah no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had um indonesian punya maid so sometimes ya
uh ya ya ya so actually um like last time my maid selalu um talk to me in in bahasa indonesia macam I know how ya how to speak ya hmm
um actually it just baru baru start so macam um macam just had like briefing then uh so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
ya I think macam health actually quite important lah um ya I rasa macam when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy macam what's the what's the point what's the point kalau kau pergi kerja everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy lah for your good for your health and stuff like that
same lah sama sama ya is is I think macam it's quite common gitu to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun in
you kerja oh so baru graduate also
oh drama side drama side macam buat apa like day to day like what is it like
oh macam just macam entertainment untuk dia punya budak-budak that kind of thing lah
hmm so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company macam allows you to to to to take breaks in between lah
mm dia mm okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common lah untuk like some some of us yang baru start kerja then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that macam when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like macam is it a mismatch of expectations bila you baru start kerja you thought it would be something else
mm actually good good that your boss macam I recognize that you you need to take a break then um then kalau when you're better than you can always balik go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me uh ya lah macam I work for dua tahun then lepas tu uh I tried dua company tapi macam uh at the same time it felt different tapi macam same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also macam tak tahu if it's the industry punya issue or kalau I need to change industry atau change company ya macam that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to macam take a break and then um from there I explored different different punya industry and then um at the same time I kerja part time then um macam trying to at the same time I explore lah whether I feel nak stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough lah one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right macam you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya at least some more now macam it's COVID punya period then then nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
it's something better than macam nothing right
ya ya ya I think to be honest macam singaporean man a bit cautious or like became fikir banyak sangat of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then kalau doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so macam just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new sekarang I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so macam at every ya every setiap pagi I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for macam tiga jam jer then um ada assignment then um some project ya just learning new things I guess
oh the the webinar is actually uh era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's enam enam bulan then ya at the same time they are macam giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya tapi those hmm tu actually untuk mid career adults lah macam those that ada work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new lah I guess ya
tak payah because everyday macam is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
but how macam mana nak teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
hmm okay I see I see I see sebab dia what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
ya macam overload of things to to do right do you feel
tapi what about the your your other work punya colleagues like do they feel the same way
hmm sounds very challenging lah macam susah so
ya so macam I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment lah so I started taking um um I started joining this financial advisory punya company then dia orang give like trainings um to to prepare us lah macam how to how to like you know prospect for clients macam how to um basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I rasa sales punya skill is quite important macam in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or kalau be it ideas or products to anybody lah so so I rasa macam it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn macam susah to macam convince people um to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process lah I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
hmm I macam baru start meeting clients that um uh there are some um potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that ah ya
so um other than that macam I think you what you said about um an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive um like make you macam want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess tapi macam I haven't actually um had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then um for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to macam earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense macam or even though sekarang I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy macam ya like I don't bangun tak rasa macam stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work macam you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this macam how I felt lah everyday after after work last time like you balik rumah macam tak ada mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
ya I think it's common like macam I spoke to my kawan my friends dia orang pun macam rasa the same the same thing lah ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
then you got try macam try company company lain tak like because ini your first job kan
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether macam is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
is it you are supporting financially ke or dia boleh pay for dia punya own things like oh is it difficult
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay um so um ya it's really macam it's I think sekarang we're in a very difficult punya position pasal there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
oh you are twenty only oh sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my mak and my my dad don't pressure me lah like because ya even though I'm already twenty five tapi dia orang macam they know it's not easy lah our time to like they said last last time by twenty five dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak you know that kind of thing but they but they don't macam push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think ah macam syukur lah like I feel quite
mm I see ya I think macam same my family macam not very affectionate also when growing up what macam don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
you ada connections with like theatre punya um like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
um actually macam I just told him I am exploring something new lah while because like at the same time also um learning like macam tengah belajar new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so macam I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything lah like I can pay for my own things like I ada savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that lah like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like ada ada like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
ya I think macam having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace lah it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing macam it you make you look forward to nak pergi kerja you look forward to seeing them
then dia orang dia orang tak bayar hmm
hmm oh you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like macam mana like how does it work
so what do you think macam you want to try ke you don't want ke
at the same time um I rasa like while we're still young important to save also lah saving is quite important ya ya so macam since since I was young kan I always believe in saving then macam I am quite thrifty lah macam and like macam tak spendthrift sangat so like I made sure to to have enough savings lah so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya
tapi you got you got try macam apply to a different company for the sponsorship for early childhood tak
oh but now is the intake right you said october you just check macam apply for fun lah like what's what's it there's nothing to lose kalau you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right hmm
ya tapi you can just tell her later kan like macam that you you're but you're officially left right you said
tapi ada notice period tu semua lah
oh kenapa
then kalau kalau you leave you must bayar dia punya six thousand ke tak like it like if you do finally decide
tapi macam you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then kalau tak then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
okay actually I ada kawan yang just started the early childhood she also was from engineering punya field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so kalau you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about dia punya program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so dia totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people macam sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not macam out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya macam some ya ya ya that feeling what's segan to us just sometimes that feel that way tapi actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience macam whatever you have experience lah then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least macam lah like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry lah then at least you roll one out
so actually I met her from um like a random punya part time job also then macam we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and macam after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya macam random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
I don't know I think macam I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of macam thought into it it's not macam a fleeting decision like I was really macam very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my punya bosses all like understand lah like my work was difficult lah like I was facing a difficult punya client macam everyday hentam on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
at the same time macam as in like I said lah because I had macam savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important lah like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing lah ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine kalau you ada children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing lah like take a break and not work kind of thing
oh probation ah macam sekarang sekarang is probation period is it
tapi dia punya contract what the contract say
no but your contract said you have so actually macam you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then dia orang tak they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
you have do you have siblings like you ada kakak or adik like
oh only one kakak lah
huh sorry oh see I see okay ya I'm also not tak tak not close to my siblings my elder siblings too pasal dia orang dah marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common lah
so um I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like macam sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that hmm that is so important macam not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
tapi macam like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to macam cafe where dia punya server is so friendly like dia bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending dia punya food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too
tak apa ah ada hot pack ada baju heat tech ada macam macam apa
it's not that you don't have anything yang cannot make you warm
tapi kalau nak pakai berapa layer layer ini baju

rendang kenapa seh
tapi kalau you makan rendang selalu like wouldn't you get like too sick of it
like kalau for me kalau I makan rendang hari hari or like
it's like jelak seh
tapi I don't like I don't like to makan
to me kalau nak makan rendang kan
just makan dengan ketupat je
I don't like serunding
no lah I don't like serunding
okay with rendang but I don't like serunding
wah if I can only eat one dish for the rest of my life I rasa kan
a bit a bit susah leh
I think ayam lemak cili api
ayam lemak cili api or kari ayam
kari ayam hm
kari ayam kari ayam if my mom masak
because because right wah her kari ayam is
kari ayam power gila babe is power gila like dia punya pedas is just nice abih makan dengan sambal belacan then
dengan nasi oof
power gila ah
I think the idea of curry noodles is bad like imagine you lemak letak cili api and then you letak
mee mee dalam ee like
lemak cili api other than that what what do you want to eat
dia punya tarik abih dia punya daging dia punya lah soft punya lah
banyak you know dorang bagi banyak abih dorang punya soup pun like sendu gila is it sendu
macam oof macam sedap like
no macam
thick is it thick like tebal
pekat ah pekat
sendu is it sendu or seru
what is the most pettiest reason that you macam
satu orang buat kan like like kalau dorang buat then you macam tak suka
macam you don't like ah like like it's like you're petty like you really macam nak tempeleng gitu
I think right for me right wah I don't like kalau kalau dorang gedik
kalau perempuan oh my god kalau kalau like any if I see this minah eh this girl come up to me macam
cakap like
eh punya lah ee macam nak
macam nak lempang je seh
like I want to hit her I want to like ee like ee can you not be so gedik a not
and then another thing is like kalau dorang macam
like dorang macam step step
dorang macam world lah world lah macam
macam world lah
like dorang macam they're like
ah ah ah macam dorang bebual terus macam eh aku aku like aku pernah seh pergi kat sini pernah seh do this do that macam like
oh I got like hit up by girls at this club you know macam
ah macam macam big macam world ah world haprak gitu ah
cuba try cuba try
oh macam dia macam like oh like like ah ape tu
macam like I'm better than you tapi actually tak lah tak lah better sangat
macam I more better but then actually you not that better lah
kita party lah sia
I think kita
kau tak payah kerja kalau we don't have to work right
what do we do I rasa we enjoy
kita party
kita macam buat hal masing masing I think we will achieve our dreams ah
I think that is for sure macam
bill bill yang nak bayar ni semua
kalau we don't have to work then don't basically macam
the only reason why we work is nak dapat duit kan
buat hal masing masing ah
we achieved our dreams like we macam finally enjoy life why what what I would say
tak ada makna ah gitu
macam tak ada makna meaningless lah
tak ada challenges ah
basically time lah I think yang the most issue for my
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like oh nothing but to me I rasa macam twenty four is like oh my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I kena kahwin kena beli rumah
to me the only factor that I rasa that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to macam
ya but at the same time macam they still like if to me that those are like lucky people macam dorang macam
bertuah lah to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though dorang dah macam tua tua gitu macam forty plus tapi macam masih dapat
dapat buka apprenticeship
buat ni semua like
but at the same time kalau asyik asyik kena
macam like if you always like you know kalau you always work work hard je asyik asyik work hard abeh lepas itu macam
macam tak ada tak ada luck like people don't like it's just not your bidang lah it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try masak you try restaurant
retail abih you try ah apa lagi ah engineering abih lepas itu
you don't know you nak buat apa
so macam you'll never run out of things to like
betul juga ah betul juga ah
what you say ada ada sense
kalau you cannot minta for like more wish
okay so my first wish I rasa I would be eternally rich
so I can beli anything that I want
macam at least macam treated as human beings lah
at least macam in terms of salary in terms of of the will
kaum lelaki tengok kita basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
but the thing is memang betul lah darjat wanita dah naik kan memang tinggi lah di islam tapi
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since kita kecil sampai sekarang dah besar pun
kalau kita nak macam you know like cakap example like wedding my friend
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because ah suami dia is apa itu anak seorang
they want to buat besar besar because they are only going to have one wedding ever
kan membazir and then like to her she feels like she don't need lah because most of the people she won't she won't even kenal
and then at the same time macam in at the same time you so you follow lah if you mampu ke tak betul tak
uh ideal matches to be kahwin
must be soft spoken must be so macam
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there macam like
yeah I like like went through whatever yang kesakitan all this nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam
is at the same time macam you do have like some of this
regret macam eh kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap yes kat dia macam
okay for the third wish kan
kita kena make it a fun one
kita kena macam as merepek ah tapi macam like
like jangan serious sangat ah
so kirakan I can masak any makanan that I want
entah eh
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to ikut recipe
I for me I don't really macam I tengok recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't macam ikut one tablespoon
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I tak ikut
you know I mean agak agak is like fun leh it's like oo you know you are making a portion or you like making something like oh it's a hit and miss like oh if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more gula and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like macam like that time I masak sambal tumis telur eh sambal tumis like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs dengan
buat sambal tumis tapi kan tak ada bawang merah tau like there's no onions
so I decided to use bawang putih
and to me because mummy kata
bawang putih is like a good alternative and also like you know bawang putih is more flavorful macam kalau you masak nasi goreng if you don't have bawang putih it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important lah basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much lah because you can literally rasa the garlicky taste
and then I did macam lada kering
and all that jazz and then after that I tengah masak kan
and then I was just like I feel like dia punya
bawang putih punya taste macam still overpowering you know
so I letak sugar and then it was like uh
so I put then I put kicap and then I put uh it was like a it was like a frenzy ah it was like a
like a carnival like basically macam
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just campak kat dalam
yes imagine you ask me for rendang
I can cook any rendang you want rendang johor rendang penang rendang sarawak
italian rendang you want the crispy rendang
rendang and yes I want uh the skin of the chicken is not crispy you know
ugh serious nye
appreciation so far macam like Singapore nights festival all this
you're going to say about the penang right the padang kari that we had in Thailand right
oh my god okay jap jap jap
apa eh okay you say yours first ah
bukan kita nak pergi ice skating ke
and leisure park sana
no kita nak pergi bowling ke apa
atas tu ada ada movie
kenapa kenapa lah manis sangat diabetes tau
then kita makan Nandos dekat berjaya time eh
apparently I kena santau
yeah I kena santau abih lepas tu I tak ada mood apparently my mum said I was someone else then I diam je then my mum belikan makan I didn't even touch it I didn't even eat it then mum hold me ah she felt like my body was ice cold
and then she was like like she baca baca all this
apparently after we left after we leave the punya mall right then then I was okay already then I rasa lapar then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay lah let's go eat dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa like some
macam sikit sikit/malay lah like
where mummy masak me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday
because like mummy right she only masak bila birthday for the rest of my sisters
but my birthday right she always masak macam sotong
or macam kari ayam lemak cili api macam this kind of but she never masak any birthday for me then I feel like eh
how come never masak me birthday then I ask ah mummy never masak me birthday for me ah
then she say you you want you nak is it then I cakap ya
then she masak me birthday and then I sakit on that day
okay what how how bodoh is it
if one horse size otter eh that one seram seh
tapi kalau hundred otter size horses
kecil kecil macam miniature gitu
ya ya ya that's true you like tendang tendang tendang then it keeps on coming back
yeah that's true that's true I think ya I think I also ambil the
is macam macam imagine kalau you jumpa lipas abih besar punya ee seram nya tapi tapi like
tak sanggup tak sanggup one is enough
yeah I think gila seh
tak ada orang yang boleh ambil dia ah like tak ada orang boleh defeat dia ah even thanos you know even thanos like start ask the army to rain down
apart from rendang if you talking about like metaphorically
kalau if you talking about food I think I will get uh kari ayam
I already say kan
kalau metaphorically I think right I'll get
a bit too sassy lah macam that's why I think people don't like
like macam macam okay a bit world ah I guess
no lah but it's more of like okay like arrogance as as in macam
entah eh arrogance as if like I'm a bit too over confident
entah eh
merepek lah what you mean intimidating you not intimidating at all lor
no as in macam is not even like you not even intimidating lorh
yeah I'm I'm talking about macam or you talking about work ah
ya but if you have to kalau you nak kena pilih satu je
Jollibee atau Arnold's
simple gila dok
ya lepas I think we can we go again
ah belum buka lagi
I think central kot like
ya dia punya fries dia punya cheese tak lokek seh
gila dia punya dia punya cheese
dia punye cause its potato bun
so is different but at the same time macam rasa muak
no lah still can go cuma tak ramai orang ah
my friend semua dah pergi seh this week I see all of them
semua pergi jewel
tak tak ramai but dorang semua pergi pergi jewel
tahu lah you ambil I lah
tak ah kata tu pe dating dating mestilah bawak kena ambil orang must fetch me from one side then must bring cannot complain you know
ada pe
berapa is it by minute or by entry
gila ah
kita pergi kita pack ah
kita kita makan kita pastu kita ciao tempat lain
okay apa
okay okay ah kita berapa lama lagi ni
lagi lima belas minit eh
kena does does it have to be one hour
mm fikir fikir
but that at the same time if you have if your body is fit your muka haprak but then your personality is nice then okay lah
and if you manage to macam you know capture me with your humor then
topic topic perbincangan
cause yellow is a good energy punya
like you look at yellow then you just like oh you know sedap mata memandang gitu
so macam
turun a bit the pain threshold
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you rasa macam
macam like if I want a sandwich I get a sandwich if I want airpods if I want a pair of airpods I get airpod if I want a laptop I get a laptop
and resale and kahwin everything
itu lah you don't have to worry
nanti what if you jadi pervert ke apa
like my greatest enemies right and then see what they're doing and then macam blackmail them
entah dia macam merepek ah
dia macam world ah I guess
to me dia macam world sikit ah
ya dia macam tak serious come on man you are the avatar man
I rasa tak keluar tak tau ah
for so macam tinggal
tapi monday I have to like upload
I mean macam I have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but I'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have I'm far behind and I have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
everybody else dorang tak macam explore tau dorang macam just do one that one that one that one that one that so macam
I don't know how they can just like not explore lah I I like exploring I like to macam
yeah I like to macam
if I see something I want to develop a bit more and more and more macam you know let it let it branch out
I see it so it's gonna be this if I see this it's gonna be this so macam
cause it's sunday kan
but I feel like this year macam I don't think they they should actually have
merepek ah like who comes up with this stuff
ya but at the same time and then like you you then dorang kata dorang nak do salute eh for nurses
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus macam at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
ya macam sausage all this kena potong potong kadang kadang pun I macam makan
okay lah is it bubble tea or macam Boost
kan I think so I also prefer Boost
ya then sometimes you just feel like like example macam you pergi interview that time I gi interview then after that I just
okay that's the thing cause if you asking about my dreams cita-cita saya nak pergi ke australia untuk continue my studies which actually I was supposed to do but then I did not cause family time I was thinking about keluarga masa dengan keluarga sangat important
pasal kalau ibu um susah sangat kalau dia nak lepaskan saya cause saya anak yang paling last
so for ayah
ayah is quite easy you know
you know but like when I was supposed to go saya not supposed to come back for like two or three years that's why you know the risk of family time is important to me so that's the thing that's the answer for that
so tak boleh yang typical macam invisible
oo tu susah
okay awak awak jawab dulu
okay awak nak jadi macam spy kids lah
mmhmm masukkan makanan dalam oven terus boom dah siap is it
awak tak sangka kan tu jawapan saya saya tahu saya tahu
iya lah
as you got wow now after we think ya masa tengah fikir ni
allah ada timing eh okay
ten years ago saya dapat jumpa sekarang
kan yang benda tu dapat jumpa sekarang okay
ya pasal saya suka collect gambar-gambar lama
ya sama macam ibu collect collect collect
mm tiga belas ya
saya tengah secondary one
a'ah macam jer cause
ah cause after second year third year habis
sama-sama lah kita macam
nak buat kawan susah lah
tak buat apa-apa pun ya pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai telephone
ya tapi saya tak boleh tidur often it's cause
uh student leader saya student leader
ya saya student leader
tapi in your secondary school
sekolah yang paling tinggi cause my school is more of a like a music school
siapa yang suka first of all
ya saya kena um bully about my looks
macam compared to primary and secondary secondary school
I prefer primary school just cause dia macam carefree at that point
right you macam tak kisah
pergi sekolah tak pergi sekolah macam it's okay
dalam sekolah apa eh
saya paling suka during saja
makanan is
simple makanan simple
like it's cause tak mahal
nak cakap murah pun tak murah sangat but
kau pergi east kan
jawapan saya is the dua dollar
dekat dah tak ada dah nak cakap innalillah pun tak boleh innalillah dah takde
dah tutup it's cause before I graduate I heard that uh they were running out of money to survive in that stall so they had to close the stall cause stall tu dengan bubble tea I ingat
saya tak fan
itu yang belakang drink stall eh
ya I remember I asked them before maggi apa dia orang pakai just cause
nak try buat kat dalam kat rumah
macam tak boleh make it tak tahu
saya rasa saya chef bob awak rasa
awak chef wan saya rasa saya tak mampu
and you know me apa-apa you kasih I I makan jer
I tak tanya apa benda saya makan jer
inshallah benda tu halal inshallah tu halal
oo soalan yang susah
wow sensitive question dia
uh waktu secondary school kan
wow I know I am I macam macam-macam lah since ah macam macam macam dari primary school it's if primary school I
it's like netball sama dia punya rules is sama macam netball
exactly the same cuma dia punya um the hoop is not the regular basketball hoop or netball hoop it's a trampoline like a vertical trampoline you have to throw it
ya very complicated tapi saya buat and then I also did
um benda ni saya tak akan lupa selama-lamanya
I nak beli air
cause it's recess time of course saya nak beli air so I pergi canteen seorang-seorang
beli air terus ada this random girl came
and then I look at her cause I macam lost kan apa seh dia ni berbual
saya tengok dia I macam huh and then she was like cause you sound like a man are you sure you never went to surgery before
okay after that selepas itu dia buat lagi and lepas tu dia buat publicly
dia depan-depan orang you know but after she did that she walked away eh no and then she said uh pretty sure you did surgery before and she walked away
saya macam tercungap tu kan so I tak tahu nak buat apa
so I just masuk dalam kelas balik then I macam just doze off cause
ya and then as the day goes by it gets worse cause like I got bullied online last time kalau you ingat like myspace blogspot was a thing
abeh macam tadi you cakap oh student
tak necessarily it's a good thing cause everybody knows you and they like to put things in each other's mouth just cause like I don't say it but they would say
I wouldn't say adulthood is like cause kalau adulthood we don't usually care about people right
if dia orang nak berbual dia orang nak berbual you know what I mean
but bila secondary school it's hard cause you have to
soalan apa susah lagi saya tak tahu macam mana nak fikir
just give myself confidence pasal kalau pasal saya insecure
and only if I had a bit of confidence to just kick out my insecurity saya rasa macam everything is gonna be okay
no saya pun tak tahu nak cakap apa
uh suka hati apa orang nak cakap saya percaya apa awak cakap
everything is susahnya soalan awak
bosan kan
agak bosan cause you're not content
so dia
saya rasa saya overthinker
you know I tukar jawapan I I actually nak cakap bali
bali balling tempat bali is everything that you
kita scared of height
conquer dalam bahasa melayu is
benda tu lah saya nak conquer saya nak conquer fear saya
saya really I'm really scared of heights
lagi rumah awak punya um yang wall tu kan yang kat luar rumah it's not like a sturdy one you know actually you know
paling worst is rumah kat toa payoh I tak tahu kalau you pernah pergi
rumah dia dekat toa payoh so like the
walkway tau it's senget so you're going down and the wall
uh the side wall it's actually very rendah like your
lepas tu I nak pekik apa tau
oo soalan paling susah lagi macam
muka macam sedih kalau tak pergi dengan awak kan takkan nak text awak babe tomorrow saya nak pergi dubai got ticket free
saya pergi um burj khalifa belikan awak
ya belikan awak
um kunci key chain right
dah tu jer lah saya mampu belikan untuk awak
makan banyak-banyak abeh sehari jer tapi dia hantar balik tak
tapi you tak tahu nak pergi mana
I tahu you
you makan jer dah memilih dah cerewet abeh you nak step
nanti dia kasih you makanan lain jer you macam
itu awak everything that you have been saying the genre it's you
mm you tahu I I tak suka movies sangat
tak tahu saya cuma saya suka falling in love the whole part of
like you get to know the person you fall in love you get a heartbreak fall in love just repeating the cycle that's me I really like it anything you tahu um nicholas sparks movies macam macam gitu favourite saya
movie dia banyak kali
tak bosan just
is cerita white chicks
itu favourite
I remember script dia semua
but tak tak macam seram ke
what's the craziest um cerita paling
yang seram I wouldn't say seram
konon macam alien ke apa ke mana tahu masih ada tapi kita tak pernah nampak
wow kita tengok banyak cerita zombie tau
so I think I don't like to think this kind of things saya tak suka saya benci fikir pasal gini
boleh anxiety tau ya cause
I think virus macam sekarang
sekarang kita COVID jer kan
although in singapore they only say like macam
I'm so sorry saya tak pernah saya tak boleh fikir lah sekarang tapi ya taiwan went to zero like really quick
actually we did though remember dulu kalau uh ada SARS
tapi SARS tak teruk macam gitu although enam tahun kan if I'm not wrong is it six years we had to go through but it wasn't like the whole world
cause I rasa
or yang bagus
ya awak ni pandai lah buat soalan macam gini
uh saya rasa
cause untuk kita macam tak ganggu kita asal kita nak kena fikir pasal benda gini
awak lucu lah um akhir hayat
awak jawab dulu saya kena fikir I'm a foodie
apa daging just daging

taste awak mahal
awak pandai lah
sebenarnya saya nak cakap pasta tapi saya macam fikir pasal diri sendiri pula
ah saya buat pasta

macam cara kita kan chef wan dengan chef bob
apa punya restaurant ni
kifarah lah pasal kita get

then selepas itu like
it's uh satu jam cycle from rumah all the way back to
the trail then selepas itu from the trail pergi rumah tak sampai satu jam pon

I tak rasa like can boleh boleh buat benda mcam gini ah because nanti terlalu penat ah selepas selepas sekolah dah penat then selepas itu nak pergi cycle selepas selepas kayuh kayuh kayuh dah lagi penat
then selepas itu
uh hari hari selpas itu masih kena pergi sekolah juga
semakin penat seh

ya rumah dia orang terlalu kecik ah then also tak boleh work out kat rumah kan
then selepas itu even if kalau dia orang work out kat rumah nanti mak dia orang kacau or like adik beradik kacau
they were like showing like macam a got these people they were doing like Zoom workouts
so like selepas itu he just buat kat tangga ah kat tangga lebih banyak ruang pe
then selepas itu also got the malay dance group
so basically they just individually semua like joget kat depan camera
but then like they just joget at the camera individually but then like they did like their own solo part then there
you just open up the game that one ah yang ada Minecraft that one then you farm farm kat dalam game
sama juga pe like you
ya tak suka ah makan sayur rasa macam rumput gitu like

tak pernah rasa lain ah
tak suka sayur tapi suka earth so mesti
so must uh buat hydroponic gitu [lah]
and eating all the kambing the kambing semua makan rumput kan
rumput buat oxygen
saya makan kambing semua untuk save the earth
ya lebih rumput you know
then macam very cool lah then selepas itu kan
I menang something
because dia orang buat macam ada kecil punya competition ah untuk macam bagi budak budak chance bawa balik benda
then after that I menang
I menang like a small pokok Ribena
I think same thing like grape ah dia like mash mash mash
then after that dia orang macam just kumpul together then buat macam syrup
ya I think the moment they like boil and then after that they make macam like concentrate
then selepas itu dia orang campur dengan air syrup gitu ah untuk buat yang kita buy itu
like more pekat ah I think I think confirm got like got like sugar inside like sugar syrup
but ya then after that I I won the pokok
no dia orang just tanya like macam
uh they just ask about the facts on the pokok ah like the hydroponic or like how how like I forgot what ah like macam
ya lah because obviously like the plants pon constantly be like uh consuming
it was the first time we I because I was one of I'm one of those singaporean got the spending power for the extra ten cents so I just bayar the extra cent
oo she like what all all those bags like the macam the mak cik mak cik always like to carry one ah
dia orang dia orang selalu pakai those macam bag very uh I think Charles & Keith Charles & Keith is like more common ones but I think like most mak cik dah rasa itu macam terlalu mahal ah Charles & Keith

but then last time the mak cik the mak cik was ahead ahead of the uh curve you know dia orang dia orang buat dulu ah dia orang yang start
they dia orang pakai tudung neelofa
dia orang semua dah dah start dulu it's the mak cik punya fault yang for for starting all this flex

tak kan nak pakai sepuluh beg kan
macam mana nak angkat though
then nanti you nak tengok cerita apa
Greenland apa lagi
to be honest kan I don't know how they record
like macam mana macam mana dia orang record
so then tiba tiba kerja continue continue continue then err
but what if they start recording okay tak apa ah then that means the movie wouldn't be out what
I mean pernah lah macam let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel kan
then macam oh disney channel then got mulan then tengok ah then like oh whatever
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad macam rasa
disappointed pasal anak dia perempuan so tak ada orang yang boleh carry on
okay what do you mean by terpaksa because if she's terpaksa kan okay at first she's a guy eh she's a woman
tak tak pernah tengok that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
she she sakit then she baring I think sick or whatever I don't know
orang tengah berbual pasal mulan
oh so even okay the dad tak boleh pasal dia sakit
tapi in the in that government even though kau sakit ke apa eh sorry
even though if you sakit
okay even if you sakit or not tak kisah you have to go is that the rule
so the the mulan dia macam kasihan kan that's why she left that note
oh what to curi
no tak the first wish yang dia buat is dia nak jadi prince
I think bukan renovation it's just macam err
ya there's no one tapi that time eh that time I went is before corona is it
cause they I think pasal dia orang dah tukar eh

I have never seen where mister teh tarik is at jurong
like banyak banyak
that one thing you did lunch time right banyak banyak kan
it's still rezeki
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one lah down there right and then after that rina uh uh recently only um enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then nak kena go and study
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing lah but you think hanisah is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not lah but it's not worth it I think it's very bodoh
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then tak payh tak payah nak leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no what
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know itu pun so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread macam roti
a'ah during that time you will see in the you know like during that time he he he he pull the the girl the girl the girl also nakal ah but the girl quite angel ah tapi macam devil lah kan but she he pull the girl and then he literally did all this then he she it was horrible lah

for ya so I thought okay you know what I don't wear like baju kurung I'm going to wear I'm going to specifically choose kurta
okay jadi kurta ni dia macam
it's very hard to find kurta dekat mana like to find where kurta is
ya so we went I don't know why but we decided tekka tekka confirm ada kurta
so but there was there's a lot of like err you know like indian wedding costume which is like lawa gila but ya oh ya that's true so so we found like a cheap one cause like I I macam I felt that it was err the first one that we tried was macam dia macam forty dollars
and lepas tu ya and then lepas tu kita went and find some more there are ada satu twenty dollars
ya ya so so kita ya so kita beli that one err without the pants you know just the baju
and then pakai baju and then okay kita nak makan sebab dia nak belanja dia nak belanja makan

oh ah okay okay can can one superpower and lagi satu is nak what you just wanna be like rich begitu or you you you you want to
ten ten K only you have one freaking wish and err ya apa yang kamu tanya is setakat ten K jer ten thousand
like eh I I bet like other people oh I have a wish okay lah aku nak um one one million but but kalau one million macam sikit sangat ah um maybe I want um
I nak err satu satu juta satu juta is it uh one billion I don't know

ah ah apa apa fikir ah fikir fikir is it seems like you
ah apa apa dia
err duduk kat kerusi then
ah apa benda yang dah sampai
ya but dah grown immune lah so macam tak kisah sangat lah
apa dia orang nak fikir fikir ah up to them lah
K if a human's kalau kita manusia tak payah macam err kerja lah then err what would you want to do
 semua ke
 bagus ah  macam gitu
 semua boys
ah  macam planning bar goal lah ni
 macam my cousin
four kids  juga so what happened was uh for them the first three
like just before university lah then  dorang pun happy happy kan yay dah  boleh semi retire
hurrah hurrah kan  mane kita nak pergi let's travel around the world
uh  macam gitu lah  kalau birthday  ni selalu we always tell people that you know ah really ah even when the adults celebrate the birthday kan frankly speaking alamak you know is really ah for the kids you know
it is really for them  pasal macam they really get into it you know  nanti kan uh  bila you tell them eh no need lah anything lah
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like oh must put this must put that oh must sing put the candle ah  semua ni kan all them ah
 ini topic eh I tell you eh I think every young adult ah will know this topic very well
kan kan  kita selalu gaduh kan
I think it's more frequent than that kan if only it was only every weekend you know  pasal every weekend kan is when you actually see tau
 kalau you  tak nampak in the week  pun kan  nanti dorang stealth tactic you know uh  behind your back ah eh  selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
ah and they will uh how shall I put this ah they don't even get defensive when you tell them eh how come ah when I was  kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
no kids uh but I was uh raising  itu my nephews my nieces kan from the time they were young lah um partly because for err me err usually lah I'm not around in singapore  pasal
I was studying away kan abroad then after that when I was working also um I was living abroad most of the time  pasal kena posting
so  selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my  apa abang or adik already  duduk kat rumah lah  jaga
my  mak kan pasal my  apa parents my late father dengan my mak my mak masih ada lah tapi my father dah  arwah so I moved them into my place lah so when I'm home in singapore ah I jaga all my anak sedara lah
err  dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa err foreign service
ah  jadi macam err
 lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say eh you go ah ah then you go lah so to be honest lah I spent most of my uh youth away  pasal belajar kan you know away in university
then I come back  pun
out of the country the thing is  ye lah kan people always say eh but you come back what you know what's the big deal but I said ya but people usually travel I don't travel I live away
that ah that the big different lah  pasal most people kan  macam business especially you go in go out  keluar masuk lepas tu  ye lah  paling-paling maybe  seminggu you know
 semalam
 ini biasa lah
 tapi apart from  macam bonus  macam grade kan I mean  takde apa-apa macam incentive  ke or
uh is just to put ah  betul lah
ya actually ah your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend lah  pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu kan one of my friend so he was
uh like you accountant also err so actually  yang hantar dia so went to  belajar lepas how many years ah three years ya three years  lepas tu balik lah  balik then of course serve the bond lah
serve the bond buat accounting kan and like you lah also quite good at it  dia punya bond  berapa eh  enam tahun masa tu
not too bad  pasal pun for them  dorang habiskan  dulu baru pergi unlike me lah  pasal for me kan disrupt uh
then ah then  pergi luar lepas tu ah  balik you see so
err  ye lah for
for me a bit different so  lepas tu my friend  balik as usual lah  kita kan
you know especially when  biasa lah kan  ada baby then baby shower
 lepas tu keep up  lepas tu kaya-kaya then  macam every  dua tiga bulan you know eh fed up lah let's go have  teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue kan suddenly he said
you know I thought very good what no  ye lah but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short  apa dia jadi nursing officer
ah  dekat hospital
until today ah  pulak sekarang COVID kan ah  pulak dia tan tock seng
ah wah high demand  bukan more in demand high demand  sekarang mengeluh aja lah so he saw already like alamak  kene shift work  lepas tu tengok sape foreign worker everyday kan
err I think that's just tip of the iceberg lah  pasal masa period gini kan  kena buat banyak lah I think the most important yang  dorang kena buat triage  macam
 semua bila datang tu kan ah  nanti is uh people like my friend and his team lah then they check and then they ask them eh you look familiar ah because after a while ah
they keep coming back  tahu because now they know what to do like oh my back pain uh  dapat oh I feeling
kan  pasal when you tell them ugh my chest ugh cannot breath sir ugh ugh ugh ah then you cannot take the risk kan
so my friend after a while wah  boleh kenal muka tahu
I mean that one for sure lah it must be twenty four hours  pasal you just never know when this virus will strike kan ah so  sebab itu susah eh for your job  yang last time  tu so you say you cover asia pac  selalunye which countries ah
ah see I'm older than you kan so  tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk lah so I covered all fifty-four african countries
 pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know ah and then djibouti  pasal starts with a D D J
so I tell eh A to Z know you think what ah fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that one wasn't posting lah that one  macam
you know  dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then after one month eh you go back there again then you go to you know um  macam namibia then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
kan um  macam gitu ah but back then ah
ah you cannot stay too long lah  pasal
so from that time ah you know  sampai ke malam ah then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work kan
so ah it's fun ah especially when you're twenty something kan  penat pun penat lah of course but you know it's fun get to see the world ah by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone ah I'm different era
you must understand ah so much harder I mean  dulu
then uh you cannot find uh where you're going  mana ada Google map Google Earth  ni semua right so wah everyone  cakap eh
and I always tell people ya you all ah think now life so mafan ah  susah lah  ini lah  itu lah  leceh lah you know but imagine my time I told them started work ah no laptop is this thing called ah desktop
oh when they  itu ambil lah kan
nah I I've been uh using until today  cuma sekarang supplement uh  gunakan Netflix kan  gunakan you know Rakuten View
ah banyak lagi lah sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two ah  macam macam dah  tak worth it  gitu lah kan  pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
 budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus eh
I went through that whole  apa uh how shall I put this ah I went through that whole cycle ah kan that whole cycle ah
twinx the magical fairy  ini semua kan that that was I went through the whole cycle
kan then you have to be always referee kan  nanti uh  yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband  lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else  abang ah then you have to be referee kan then when the cousin  semua datang ha  lagi lah kalang kabut
on uh handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them kalau nak tengok semua share okay
ah  macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right  macam mana pun kan I mean cannot lah you know when ipad first started kan I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put kan  dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
 macam kenapa lah you know maybe lah you call me jurassic eh  pasal I'm conservative about this thing kan  macam huh why is your baby looking at Youtube lah and this and that kan to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry  pasal dia punya lung
get exercise  tahu
 cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor lah you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying  pasal babies are
father of four kan you  tahu lah kan  budak-budak ni semua  bila nangis then you  kasi attention  sikit aja semua okay
exactly exactly ah  sama lah
no  pasal you  pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family  keluar kan
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point ah oh my friends  semua marah if I
say things like that you know ah  kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so  macam no lah you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures what
kenapa I don't tak faham apa-apa you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids ah
said  biasa lah
eh let's face it lah you know even we as teenagers ah last time kan remember when your mother  tanya score  macam mana ah okay lah
lost your homework  kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
ah tease out kan bit by bit and find out  semua kan all these kinds of things lah
no I think until you basically die I always remind people  pun kan you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them ah you are still ah
people over and over again lah kan  pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off  macam even  lepas I  hantar last time lah eh my  anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
although  ada maid ada  dia punya you know grandmother  kat rumah kan
but I don't think it's it's just you I think uh there are still a small but good number of people yang macam you and that's good  tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about  setahun gitu for one
you know take some time talk to them kan  tanya-tanya macam mana kan then you realize actually they are quite neglected
mm  tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know  macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them  macam manja-manja dengan teacher  pasal macam
dah lah  every day pergi sekolah kan and even during COVID and home based learning kan they see the teacher still online kan  pasal
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two kan wah  budak-budak semua balik sekolah kan
no more home based learning for many schools kan wah most parents hurrah hurrah  pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out wah
 betul kan
 ni macam shift work kan follow the time zone so tell the kids okay ah  tidur eh
ah  betul
or you can travel a bit lah take one day off to maybe  beli-beli barang boleh beli present kan
mm  beli present kan ah
especially if nearer to the school holiday  ke kan
 musim apa musim sejuk
you're lucky if is brown lah  selalunye kan is more like like greyish black  tahu
and then the other thing is I call it slushy  pasal is really that  macam yang that seven eleven  punya slushy you know the Slurpee ah kan  pasal it's
ah the colour of course Slurpee  lebih sedap lah you know
when you walk around kita kan  tak biasa pakai waterproof boots and this and that
and that's the thing I I don't like about that lah  tapi london during that period also nice lah  pasal christmas ah
wah  pergi london bridge
 empat-empat
 kenapa tak pergi itu euro Disney
wah ni mesti makan chocolate ah
 ni nak tengok that little statue of that little boy peeing lah kan
 tengok bola lah wah
correct  sebelum Grab lah mm
ah  itu lah
 tapi dapat tangkap glamour ah
 dia bayar itu lah family ah
your  kawan jadi super sub ah
ah kan  ada
for me last time I would go to manchester  macam a few couple of months I go up  pasal I was studying kan that time
oh  lepas tu nanti one of
not one ah couple of my friends  semua gila bola juga
then  dorang ada that time uh subscription ah
 macam membership you know so but the good thing is being asian  dorang semua mana macam muka kita
so we go and we go  bukan uh division one  aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for  yang macam
 pasal takde big name  takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
mm mm mm I was posted to paris  tapi from paris I also cover uh three other countries lah I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so  empat
country lah  yang kena jaga so for me ah when people come usual lah you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget ah I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
ah  pasal
and  kalau pergi london  tu just outside  selalu ni all this uh
housewives all these  makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
ah  dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world lah so wah shiok you know so I was in paris uh two zero four to eight so  empat tahun ah  kat situ
 nanti nampak yang that  lampu tu lah kan  dia macam lighthouse kan every night ah ah so I'll see that light lah
eh  penat juga budak-budak
 naik stroller lah two of them
actually gare du nord when you  keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal  banyak kebab  banyak yang maghrebian  nya kan  yang daripada morocco  daripada daripada mana eh uh
ah  ada dua option satu you just  naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down  pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's  macam symbol lah paris kan so  bila
 bukan sabotage  bukan ada terrorism
 sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat  ni semua dorang touring kan it's really really
ya and I do miss uh living there  pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world lah you know without a doubt lah you know
paris eh  memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london  macam K lah you can walk a bit a bit lah  tapi after a while  macam
ah boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and  macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery kan
 kena tengok bawah lah  pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni kan
they got lah  nanti after COVID
after COVID even for me  pun frankly lah eh  lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore lah  pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly  dekat singapore lah
 tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice lah  pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my  mak kan seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend ah  masuk johor lah
mm and also  pun aiya you know  boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids kan like I've got even uh grand nephews grand nieces kan  yang dekat malaysia then its easy to uh go to
Legoland kan  pergi makan-makan
only be able to travel kan pergi johor and whatever  sebelum kita boleh really go out there again lah
know  dekat-dekat lah you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know um  pasal every day before COVID kan between two hundred to three hundred thousand eh  dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu kan  bukannye satu dua ribu kan
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right  pasal apa dia punya
 penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
obviously lah but also don't forget catered also for the johorians who work here  pasal
as soon as you hire one kan then  dorang buka kan payroll payroll  nye tu ah so  dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
ah  dia by two kan when you go there  sekarang some shops lah they definitely accept Nets which is good lah you know
 pasal even for their workers kan  lepas tu balik malaysia lah  nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up kan nak tukar duit
kan when their salary is already in sing dollars so  dorang alah pakai Nets aje lah  lebih senang
 tak susah
but you can tell ah  macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites kan  yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town  betul lah
is really bad  macam city square tu kan
um  orang semua tengok wah really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully lah it'll be a slow and painful process lah but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not  macam kita aje kan you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so  macam gitu aje lah
ah that's always good question  tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me  macam each one is so different kan so
you know ya  pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know lah budget pun  bukannye banyak kan even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type  macam
you know you just  ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know  macam you  tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you  tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of  teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did lah you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd  lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends kan ah so for me that's where it's quite you know
but I must say um not so much now lah but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me  pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest  yang dorang  baru jer  buka kan err
 orang asing you know so was a lot of fun lah you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
orang melayu ah or like someone who belajar melayu
you rasa
to improve dorang punya
yes belum keluar
oh kat yang bedok is it tanah merah
apa tu err
and I got like three days off you know how I told you macam I
sepuluh hari lagi left
slowly slowly ah slowly gila
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths uh they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit macam
ah macam gitu lah ya
but apa tu
the apa tu the
kurang ajar seh kurang ajar gila
it's not it's tak compulsory tapi macam
eh asal you tak baca dulu sebelum you buat paper
okay I think that was me in in apa tu in
secondary school also when kita buat lit
okay jap
speedy ni
speedy tak tahu lah
dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini tau like everytime dia
everytime kita nak everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
okay lah okay lah tak cukup attention
tak cukup apa tak cukup attention kesian dia
but apa tu
so dia baru join
because there was this other person but he selalu
ya it was quite rabak uh
err apa tu err
ya lah abeh nak mandi semua
so anyway he told me that lah he told me macam
so macam he was damn lost ah
my language classes then dia macam
dia macam tak cakap apa-apa never say anything so aku macam okay
ya so it's a bit macam give me some heads up uh
tu lah
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot paksa orang to
datang and you know
and then macam it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I have to really plan macam straight away after finish
pastu keluar lepak and then go straight to work atau sleep a bit more and
tidur jer kerja
ya and because my shift pukul berapa pukul tiga
no takde takde takde
no they dorang big fans of macam the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill uh actually
tu lah maksud dia
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything ah because it's a totally lain punya client ya
ya she she took chemistry in the pastu um
that I've been very complacent macam I've
not complacent macam terlalu banyak
err oh yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok the the deadline and all that
abeh kita proofreading we put everything ah like whether the date is correct
the numbering and all that and the oh categorisation and all that is betul
macam whether they
whether they apa tu
volunteer because kita punya kerja kan banyak ada nak kena chope
macam you must chope certain deliverables lah
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of macam mana kita kerja
okay so pukul tiga setengah I bangun
let's say pukul lima we have to send headlines
because I'm the kind of person yang I cannot tunggu for people
like I'm not a apa tu
that was last time uh remember I told you there was like one time in between july sampai
september ke august
just jaded like macam
so dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat
orang ketiga lah
apa benda home wrecker
no I think dorang nak more natural conversation so that
I know lah but macam we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
I don't know takut it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kesian seh
ya what have you been watching lately cerita
good tak it looks like very old
berapa episode berapa season
satu jer ada
okay bagus
ya it's so sad uh banyak
banyak but
shows nak kena
either like postpone their dorang punya release because of COVID
bila dia when is it supposed to be
ya same as apa tu yang mugen train also what it was released quite super damn early in apa tu
in japan lepas tu like only came in singapore berapa bulan jer nanti
ya macam
not transfer macam how they send over copies to
macam but what what cloud can carry that then how we have google drive
ya I'm I'm so interested in that macam I think that's what
to datang in like in a dalam ada bawa briefcase
wait so back then actually dah ada
err apa tu portrait on
ah nak kasi nanti lah sekejap lagi
ya twenty more minutes sayang
speedy nak say something
okay tunggu kejap jer just now I give you food you don't want to take
pastu macam gini ah how how how anyhow like that can ah
tak don't breathe on the thing
ya macam
apa tu err different types of
jap eh do you want anything from pasir ris
tak nak my brother can get Gong Cha you want
ya macam
then macam
I don't know lah there could be those directors yang very macam oh I need this shot
I need this shot it needs to be this particular way you know macam
ya what what kind of movie would you film melayu
would it be more macam
embodies that the most yang paling
paling like paling dekat show that the kind of movie that you like
okay more prominent ones yang kita tengok Handmaiden tu was it good
mm macam the food change eh food chain
wah takde movies what movies is
you know what I mean like you it makes you think macam oh my god whoa
but like you know when he went through the apa tu
kan ada I don't know whether the lady or the man yang cakap
if dia go through the door
did we watch another movie together about the the cerita indonesia
yang ugh was I with you
it was this cerita pasal
who had to balik to balik kampung sebab
dia nak reconnect dengan family dia ke apa
ke oh dia nak dia nak cari
remember yang dia hang baju pastu
cerita apa eh
yes yes yes that one yang tu yang tu
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like uh tanya or ask anyone I don't know
but this kind of thing definitely need macam to set up to set aside like at least
oh yes you're right you're right betul betul betul
betul betuls okay lah
cute gila oh my god it's very cute
ya ya I dah wash lagi I dah basuh
I dah kering
I dah apa lagi err vocabulary boleh kasi dorang
I kering I dah squeeze dry
I dah compress tu jer
ya I dah I've done quite a lot of things lah
ya so as in it's drying now tengah nak kering I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
bawa balik ah mana satu yang you nak
because it all looks so pretty semua lawa gila
dia macam those who know will know right
and then people think like err this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai jer
ya we've talked about this before berbual
like you know how when it when it's macam when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
dia macam it feels a bit cheaper because like
oh now they are going more mainstream lebih mainstream
popularity of macam demon slayer for example
not as popular of course lah but macam ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise nak beli nak beli apa lagi
ya macam these merchandise nak beli baju you know
ya lah but macam if you if it were another show for example macam Fruits Basket
atau I don't know what's another show I don't hear it err hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular eh macam you know what I mean
well known so macam that's why I say there's pros and cons ah
you tahu kan I ada classmate jepun in my korean class
so dia
so macam most of us kita ambil sebab kita either
kita tengok cerita K drama dengar lagu K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so I asked her like oh how about ya so I asked her macam
and she say macam
macam real people
the life in japan macam how was her school life or like at least lah
she's quite nice lah then she shared with me like about her school life uh how dia kerja part time
quite interesting ah it's it's I love this class because macam
and like the eleven year old punya remember I berbual pasal
cute gila
ya because like I like I talk to her about macam my trip to yogyakarta the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also macam in jakarta and how dia rindu lah rindu gila dengan jakarta tapi she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place paling
tak kat yishun not at yishun
and then um dia macam I don't know
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to um calculate lah because dorang punya numbering is very susah gila it's like
dorang count kan dorang punya currency besar gila kan
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia sama juga
so nak kena you must really calculate lah
banyak fikir ah I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
exactly but macam
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to layan my korean I feel like I'm such a
lawa gila it's very it's super damn it's super nice
hello hi how are you I nak minta tolong sikit lah boleh tak
tu lah my parents nak makan nasi padang ah but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best nasi padang in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like hajjah maimunah you know but other than that cause hajjah maimunah I went went there just now today they're not open
mm tak kisah lah
I think I think I know I think I know yang mana satu we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried sana sedap eh
oh is that type lah I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that kena eh tak payah eh
oh sebelas this is for lunch lah
ya nasi padang I think the most of the places jarang ah eh I think but there's one place I don't know you pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa eh nama dia I think it's called sari ratu you pernah pergi sana buka I think like pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka tau
I actually have no idea but I pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu
dia punya lauk masih still looks fresh lah tak tak rasa macam
since pagi ke apa maybe dia orang masak petang juga but okay lah kalau in case you keluar dengan your family or your friends
tekak you nak makan nasi padang you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road lah but it's it's quite near the kampong glam area like baghdad street or something like that
oh apa nama tempat dia eh
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall kalau pergi sana I think
okay lah I think I will try that that what minang place there
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing err my parents dia orang nak makan sana cause just nice lah think after that I boleh ke nak jalan around the area beli kain-kain ke apa-apa
that that area got a lot of kedai-kedai macam gitu kan jual kain lah jual buku-buku lah jual baju lah carpet lah
tak tahu eh belum ada plan but around that area got a few malls kan
for the house I don't know like pinggan mangkuk ke apa think whatever ya lah
dia orang nak beli I think nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak I think can bring to think bugis junction quite near
ya lah I think everywhere lah the same but now if possible duduk rumah more ya cause if you have to go out also yang no choice then kalau nak keluar you buy whatever you need to buy you beli dah beli dah makan ke apa then terus balik then kalau you nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue nak kena tunggu and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now banyak orang buat gitu lah tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa you nak beli kadang-kadang you beli online you tengok colour ni
nanti datang colour lain
kita kita boleh hantar balik kan dia orang boleh
tak boleh refund ke
wah ya lah and gambar you tak boleh cannot
trust kadang-kadang
then in the end what happened did you makan the nasi jer
I think I think got banyak lah I dengar complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
untuk self pick up you know you order then you pergi sana sendiri you you you
you pick up the food sendiri then I order at first they say the food should be ready dua puluh minit then I dah sampai sana I tunggu almost one hour baru the food siap
that one lagi self pick up kalau I tunggu dia delivery I think mungkin more than one hour but this was back then lah during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think semua orang order
pernah order grab takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah kan
tu lah nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup then bila order tunggu satu jam ya lah that time I I ada satu friend pun dia ceritakan dia order I think err mothers' day I think
ah dia order pun dia order err
dia dah order tunggu lama-lama the punya app cakap waiting for driver nak dekat dua puluh minute in the end tak ada dia dah order order order tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap cancel dah tunggu twenty minutes uh huh
day ada orang dah advance order the day before to arrive for example eh dia cakap you order for today esok dia suruh deliver for makan tengah hari
pukul dua belas ah on the next day lah they advance order lah then when it comes on the day half an hour before dia orang cancel dia punya order
orang orang nak buat celebration dia orang buat macam gini tu lah
ya lah but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault lah it's all the the the the restaurants kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana then restaurant yang cakap cancel but dia orang tak fair lah then the driver the rider kena marah
I think maybe for safety juga lah I think kalau satu not not dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver lepas tu orang tu cakap eh dalam eh inside my my packet got
for example lah dia cakap I see hair then they complain kat restaurant nanti restaurant will cakap eh but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant dia orang lah pasal dia orang yang pack makanan so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy kerja dia is just to send so kalau
ya ya lah you can see tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard err I got one friend kawan I satu err whenever dia order
kasih dia orang tip kasih cash ya lah but sometimes a'ah dia kasih extra like maybe two dollar ke lima dollar
I tak tahu lah I think so but I think maybe
maybe dia orang order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya lah but good lah then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot what kalau dapat tip and not say
kerja dia orang senang ya lah senang as in cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang customer complain lah customer marah so I think once in a while ada orang
kasih tip macam gitu
kasih dorang macam motivate dia orang lah at least ada juga orang yang
baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah jer
tu lah cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada deliver kan bagus eh tapi I cari semua tak ada
tapi nasi ambeng ada deliver tapi nasi padang I think tak ada
kesian lah
dia tak ada offered to refund ke apa-apa that's not good actually
cannot lah the customer dia orang bayar apa
so nanti esok you nak ikut tak I nak pergi cycling mm
I think kita dah quite long time kita tak pergi changi beach lah
takpe lah we go kita pergi early lah morning you know I mean by by tengah hari we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya lah this quite some time I pun dah lama tak tak ride my bicycle
you punya bicycle masih ada tak then okay lah is it the same one that you beli dulu
cause recently I think that day I I I ada beli I went to the bicycle shop lah to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet dah dah koyak dia punya strap I was talking to the owner of the shop dia cakap sekarang like everyday dia jual like maybe
I think so cause that time dia orang tak boleh
wherever lah tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang lah tak boleh pergi shopping lah
I think dia baru baru buka lah aiya maybe I don't know tak tahu eh
maybe lah I think they they the the new movies I think maybe kalau rasa
you rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi
tengok maybe they wait lah they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
ya there's no apa
esok esok kita pergi to changi after that after that kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak mm
okay kita pergi the famous one lah kat sana yang changi
I think the I don't know I think maybe the sambal lah okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
esok kita boleh try lah kalau kalau kalau makcik
beli I senyum kalau pakcik then you senyum okay think just nice lah so we go cycling then go nasi lemak ya then after that we head back
tu dah macam yang kat bangkok kadang-kadang boleh panas
abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu ya
I think dia punya macam
ya lah I think dia punya mungkin usually like that dia punya dia punya what you call that dia punya longkang ah dia punya drainage sumbat of course lah then kalau dia punya rain was like that day
pagi sampai petang what six seven hours ya lah
if the rain that much then the drain sumbat mana air nak pergi
ya lah tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang those landed property
okay lah but this kind of weather I think susah nak predict kalau you tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan or the other way that day pagi hujan lebat then dia stop
I think dia orang also just tikam jer lah
maybe it's the other side maybe you kat east side tampines maybe kat choa chu kang ke jurong yang hujan right mm kadang-kadang like like that what not the whole singapore
uh oh kesiannya then
mm mm that means ya lah lama lah
I think most of the the what you call it apa dia panggil dengue hot spot eh dah banyak dulu I think tak banyak tempat I think near my place also kat pasir ris ada there there there's err
one case opposite my block mm ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum dengar then terus dia pergi luar dia check dia punya pasu-pasu bunga make sure tak ada because kalau the officers datang
they can summon you kan I think ya so kalau you have like tak lah
I tak tahu I think they come random lah it's either that or either that or I don't know eh mungkin kalau ada neighbour yang complain tak tahu kalau the neighbours suspect you you tak
maybe lah maybe dia orang they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe dia orang take like a a sample
of the water something like dia orang bawa
dia orang punya lab agaknya dia orang check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back lah they take some sample of the air bawa balik to lab then run dia orang test agaknya lah but ya lah sometimes they will check what even if they cannot see kalau dia orang tengok let's say rumah you
ada ada plants ada potted plants then dia punya air dia tengok eh macam tak tukar they will tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air do you change everyday because by right you kena tukar so at least if
happen to be the nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau you tukar hari-hari
then dapat dapat
but you you get to buang dia punya telur apa ah kalau let's say you
tak tukar I pun tak tahu I pernah baca I don't know lah maybe takes a few days lah maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the nyamuk
telur to tukar lah so kalau you leave it for that long then maybe you might kena summon lah kalau dia check so that time my my mum dengar dia terus check
ya lah kat rumah pun semua tukar at least everyday lah
ya lah so kita
kalau ya lah because the the like what's the
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang
tu lah
kalau you kena gigit pun mm
so I think if you if you rasa macam you kena gigit dengan mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor lor dia punya mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then dua tiga hari lepas tu you demam I think better go doctor you check
ah tak ada dia
mm then that one can can can lead to complications lah kalau tak kalau biasa punya after some time it will it will get better ya lah but leceh lah you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you kena dengue
then you cannot see what kalau dia nak gigit you dia pun tak tak warning
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day dia punya the number of cases for COVID lah was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
these countries I guess because dia orang punya
ya then some of them might not be even kat hospital you know
ya ya lah because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers tak boleh kerja kan
semua orang first time pun tak tahu ya but
foreign workers was was told to quarantine eh quarantine themselves duduk kat dalam dormitory tu kalau I tak tahu rumah you you tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat my office pun sama dia punya
dah tak terjaga ya lah that shows
the foreign workers are important only time time macam gini then people realise oh ya ya lah this during this difficult
period you boleh tengok macam orang yang what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like macam those tadi kita complain pasal grab food driver and all that ya kalau you imagine kalau dia orang tak ada that time circuit breaker you nak makan macam mana
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch baru dapat
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody bersihkan know your around your area under your block all that
ya lah but tempat your workplace how you still going to work or
when that day I think I was at the area lah raffles down there lah you can see I was there lunch time macam tak ada orang mm can see that there is definitely different lah you see the lunch time crowd macam more like a ghost town I would say
including my my tempat kerja pun I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen lah sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause sekarang dah berapa tiga eh dah tiga since march dah lima bulan dah
working from home still masih survive apa so why do they need to like rent office mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap business jalan
kalau you kat rumah pun at least you save transport right if ya lah our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
maybe the only thing yang you spend more I rasa mungkin is just your utilities lor
kan bila at home
if not usually you are at home malam-malam and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven hari-hari
because bila dulu time sebelum all these terjadi orang semua nak keluar so sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah
ya betul
iya lah mana dia orang nak pergi
airline pun even the airline nak pergi pun the the the I think the government doesn't allow
kat singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though kecil still got a lot of places if you want to explore
give them more things to do if all the businesses tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat
takkan nak tengok jer eh but everything
ya I think like hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa
ya kalau tak it's not like kita
we said what the wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun the cinemas belum buka so
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new macam wayang I mean filem-filem yang baru mungkin more people will will go kalau tak ada orang not interested ya lah at least they have entertainment at home or more
your ya but I think no choice lah sekarang semua kena gitu
ya like dulu pun macam apa tu during bulan puasa orang nak bayar what you call that the zakat fitrah ya but now also everything online what dulu people would queue at the
masjid you know mm even
the yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya I think all the woodlands jurong I think they were I forgot I think tak salah I ada sepuluh ya ten different places where they have the celebration lah ya
ya kalau dia orang buat dekat the same place then more people will go there what so I think they have to lah to to elakkan orang go to like the padang or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people tak akan you know berkumpul at the tempat which is better lah everything lah like err I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
ya lah cannot lah some more lagi that kind of event I think you're talking about
saw got people post gambar-gambar yang the river singapore river lah the some of the beaches the sea looks
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi and then kita kat sini I mean we don't experience that that lah but for me personally I tengok bila during circuit breaker tak banyak kereta you can see like you said bila kita pergi jogging kat luar ke apa macam
lagi fresh dia punya air tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also lah that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
apa yang yang I nak cakap you tak payah spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business lah like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves lah but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you ada whatever lah
hobby baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu lah eh
main gitar bernyanyi lah
ya kalau if this thing didn't happen you you'd takkan tahu yang all this thing you boleh buat so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side lah or what
kita complain complain hari-hari pagi petang malam pun you complain also the thing will still remain then takkan today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
true ya but I guess people are just people dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak complain dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap right
macam ni lah government government kasih duit orang complain government tak kasih duit pun orang complain
betul kita cakap orang pun I think kadang-kadang I pun complain juga
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you nak kena tengok you tak boleh degil you know nak dengar cakap you jer
complain but at the end of the day I think especially kita kat sini kat singapore I think kita still not as bad as you compare to other countries
you can't even I mean you can maybe you boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin you boleh beli
beras all those barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin
satu minggu sekali but still singapore I think
itu pun ada orang kan that time berapa a lot of people masuk facebook masuk stomp tak nak pakai then kena kena all the officers suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal
ya by right bukan susah benda tu nak ya lah macam like
I see them tu lah that time
government kasih free leh nak minta dia orang pakai
a'ah seh busy dengan kerja semua
sekarang pun COVID then quite you know susah nak handle lah you know COVID dengan kerja dengan sekolah what are you doing right now
you kena lepas kerja eh

it's like malas nak pergi mana
buat kita malas the whole thing
I don't even go out my house kalau boleh just order

your area like limited to places to eat lah macam gitu
oh you tinggal mana
you tinggal mana
it's like totally malam-malam tak ada benda nak makan kan then you just
ah you really masak maggi ke masak apa
but sederhana lah you know
just biasa punya
west mall no west mall dekat bukit batok situ pe
what else I forgot ya ada banyak lah ya but that's the
tu kat jurong east lah
so mendak I don't know lah
ya lah I go town you know by the time you habis kerja
it's like lambat already then you just wanna go home
what oh what ah apa tu your tempat situ apa twenty four hours eh
ah ya ya ya I know mister teh tarik ya there is also one outlet at my area tapi
jauh ah I don't think nak grab grab doesn't cover
ah the pressure bila nak kahwin oh my god are you attached
it's a good opportunity to get married ya ya alamak nak kahwin nak kahwin should I kahwin no lah it's okay lah
twenty eight so my parents cakap ah
no lah also no pressure for me cause I prefer kalau boleh nak habiskan sekolah dulu then
ya focus on kerja
uh I think I prefer that seh kalau macam gitu cause like
some more my cousins semua kat malaysia kan so they cannot really come in to singapore
ah tak apa lah you know just make do with what we have right now lah you know
ya he's gonna get engaged then next year then married lah tengok macam mana lah because
he he's the kind to prefer kalau
all my cousins ada
and most of my cousins semua kat malaysia so tengok dulu lah macam mana
kalau phase three they allow us to you know
I feel like malaysia sekarang macam
dapat pergi malaysia fuh full on
pergi usually if I go there I pergi mana eh
johor bahru yang
ah pergi johor bahru ah dekat apa tu the mall nearby
ah city square mall also pun kat situ pun ya
murah-murah pe barang
ya you normally ya ya you through the woodlands ke tuas side depends
boleh lah kalau
right now kalau kalau boleh right I just want to not wear the mask cause it's so freaking rimas
kakak famous
I feel you I feel you okay ah there are also macam there are also perks to wearing masks ah like you don't have to tegur
all the time like you see people right you don't have to tegur what because you don't know they don't realise that it's you you know
ya tak
ya tak perasan lah
bila nak snow eh
bila nak snow ah
panas sia
so right now you still cari kerja lah
so right now you still cari kerja lah
oh okay lah uh right now pun I feel that
ramai orang yang tak ada kerja they can apply for this um
I pun ada apply I pun ada apply for other jobs but they also gave me the same reasonings like oh you are overqualified or you are underqualified
the macam for certain positions they will say macam um
tak ada hal panggil hal ah
right now pun aiya susah lah as long as I feel that kalau dapat kerja pun ambil jer lah eh
ya lah tengok condition dia lah you know some people they just
so kalau pay is not good
oh kerja apa tu
cause I applied for teaching macam english you know languages lah basically
ah macam tak faham ah I just
tapi ya ya papaya lah you know just
leceh lah it's just part of the routine right sekarang
ya lah it's always like that lah the management sometimes when you tak when you don't have a good management right
wait she say like that she say like word for word gitu
she say like word for word macam gitu
was minta kena sepak sia
ah dah burn ah tak payah lah
apa tu right now pun macam susah ah kalau nak
either work from home or face to face ah I preferred tapi
also depending lah like cause I'm doing project right like I said then macam
projects so basically uh kalau ada apa apa
ya ya you know the kalau
macam ugh malas ah it's better to do face to face ah you know like lincah can just
whatever lah right now pun
so ya I know kat sini quite bising
um right now kat sini ada renovation my area sini
it's a bit suffocating kalau you stay at home work from home
rimas ah
but I think kalau nak kalau nak kahwin sekarang pun macam
go the proper way kena ada majlis perkahwinan
that one that one I don't know sia I don't know I don't actually know how it works kalau your partner is a non-muslim
I tak tahu seh ada benda macam gini
no I don't tak tak ingat pun you ada cakap
cause you are thirties right do you feel the pressure from your parents kalau your parents ada pressure you
your parents ada pressure you
kan kalau you are studying normally you just focused on studying right
so I I tend to neglect kalau ada
get the wedding cause some people they get married first kahwin dulu ah then
ya I just nak keluar rumah you know have your own
he cannot really move into my place also because I think kecoh ah
I think kecoh ah
I don't prefer kecoh
which kecoh no not that kecoh
uh it's cramped kecoh
my brother pun nak kahwin kan end of december I I hope
cause like kecoh
the house is just cramped ah sekarang my house ada enam orang
is those it's not even petty crime it's just weird crime macam
bawa passport
kena bawa passport
actually ya pretty I think because jurong my area jurong west kan uh banyak
some more there's not much um my area there is just macam industrial there's not much activity going around
it's quite scary lah kalau balik malam-malam then
ya then ada juga uh pencuri which is
then I jalan balik
I told my parents ah then my parents macam cause my parents are in the
ya my parents on gila lah you know they are all in all these
eh seram pe
it's always like that you always get kerja somewhere far away from your house
my office work my main office is at town what so I'm like ah malas
malas the crowd no
my office situ is like
so I uh it's crowded lah especially kalau in the morning kan nak ambil public transport
fact that you feel like seram ah especially if you go home late at night
you you can you can stay at jurong east if I'm not wrong jurong east ada
ya certain areas macam um
you know uh malls or ke apa
like I I also had the same mentality as you macam um
wait so right now dia
dia just kerja ah I mean sorry dia just sekolah lah
wah kecoh
oh but then that semester break is I think is just macam cari
you know bulanan
oh sekolah uni
no belum
get a get a real job yes ha susah sia nak cari kerja sekarang
err I ya lah but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me uh pasal my wish is my need ah right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish ah to something else I tak tahu apa ah
dia orang cakap by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb err
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know oh my god I don't know how we gonna do it lah but ah I rasa dia punya
dia punya the struggle is gonna be real lah like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless kita hop on trends or unless
we have quality content lah but I think we have quality content eh I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that err getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I rasa itu paling susah lah sia
I think you are confusing streaming dengan video kita memang buat video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the err console to record the whole the whole the whole session
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing ah so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play lah because I don't think people wanna do that yet kita kita not at that level lah nor we want to venture there pasal kita I think
streamers orang they are like deejays they are like radio deejays dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak inside jokes ah where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff lah but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality ah ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
so people will be interested lah I I I baca dekat dalam dekat youtube dia orang cakap if you want to start something like this ah you have to be you have to know what you are
uh like you are trying to focus on ah macam
macm kita kita nak kena main this specific game jer tau because what people want is people want
this content from you jer so you macam the speciality ah so ya macam they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a macam a doctor advising sickness what that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy kita nak kena like specialise in this one game jer and then like a random kadang-kadang kita we see if we can selit one or two games inside
apa like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game lah ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I rasa challenging sia
tak ah of course not man
kita punya tak begitu sia I I make sure the content that we kita push out semua quality sia I mean it it should provoke a feeling lah and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness err like you kalau ketawa I think that's that's quite good already ah where we ini kerja keras like a no brainer you just tengok habis doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad lah pasal kita edit susah payah kerja keras sia ni
oh the live stream one memang tak ada apa-apa like only live stream one is really moments lor the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
settle sia I dah belikan safwan dah
err I rasa like fifty err so ya I think fifty to hundred and fifty ya it was quite cheap
because kalau pergi yang kedai betul punya
but this one I got it for cheap lah like dekat Ali Express so that was good
so I think they have to like get the measurements right actually I also don't know whether they got the measurements right cause err I mean it fits ah I have no complains ah so I assume they the custom made it ah cause they they asked to put the measurement and I did measure myself ukur ukur ukur ya
got your help with that ah you ukur kepala ukur shoulder ukur my forearms
for the kids is just S M L I dah belikan safwan tengah on the way safi tak tahu kalau dia nak pakai ke tak maybe when he's older a bit
spider gwen ah okay okay ya tengok ah rezeki kalau ada lebih
I rasa nak pakai black cat lah no black cat is a spiderman version of cat woman but he's a black cat no
yes no I don't know I tak pernah where got spider spider cat is cat not a spider I say black cat I never say spider yes
I rasa nanti I minta cheese fries ah
tomorrow tomorrow dah call dah kalau tidak
take lah half day bila lagi nak ambil
next two weeks baru christmas
next week ada apa
ya is it bila you on leave right I thought you have long leave like
I accumulate dua puluh hari sia you
I selalu I selalu err selalu like fikir macam like last year punya tu I selalu tak nak habiskan I selalu simpan for the day that I want to leave the company
my plan is always to keep leave so I can macam ni I have to serve notice two months sia you now at least I clear leave I serve like
no lah from dulu sia I macam itu
I selalu tak nak habiskan if I can bring forward I will bring forward
there is no point in I don't know lah to me macam kalau kita tak kalau kita ambil leave to not go on holiday why would you want to take that leave
some more kita tengah work from home kan
bila dia hospitalised eh
because it's not dia tak tu ah dia nak kena kita punya sink kan dia punya bawah tu kan gemuk
IKEA punya is you remove that sink ada pipe theirs is for that pipe jer kita for the whole gemuk punya thingy
there is but it won't be err apa tu macam flush ah
the it's it's like a is a triangle so it's two triangles lah kalau you nak beli is two triangles but because it's not flush because that thing is gemuk dia it will protrude out lah so you won't be flush so you will be like ke depan ah
because kalau buat satu then the other one tak buat then the next time kena buat then is like err what buang masa but I think it's fast kan yang that time your father tukar jamban knock knock knock letak jamban baru macam cepat sia like in less less than a day dah habis sia ya that time remember ya lah he call somebody ah your err abang punya father

pergi ketuk the jamban your old jamban inside your guest toilet the habis dia dia ketuk ketuk ketuk dia keluarkan jamban ambil jamban baru dia letak I was there I was watching ya probably you were at work but ya that was the whole thing that was like the whole jamban experience

I I hope satu hari ah I hope so that
anime ada banyak type like what's your genre in anime
aku pun agree
selain anime
tak tahu ah this one is your favourite or not but it is two days one night
oh he's I don't know when is the last time I watched two days one night tak tahu ah bila
I tengok running man jer
my favourite girl group uh tak tahu ah pernah dengar ke tak
kalau aku ingat it is
agaknya that time
kalau uh I
but dekat sini
makanan apa you suka
like asam rebus you know especially when
I also think macam itu juga ah
kalau for me
um selain McDonald's what's your favourite fast food also
yes ya dia dari uh datang dari filipino
I boleh makan like three piece or five piece of chicken
it's just sedap
tempat dia dekat sana juga ah I think we talking about the same thing
and err ya mostly barang macam
mee goreng combo
because it's near dia dekat dengan botanic garden ah
I always eat dekat Adam's Corner
cause you just need to uh naik bridge
and and you already reach it uh macam dalam five minute
if I go makan there I think
maggi goreng combo and the drinks I think
oh I'm sorry my melayu rabak sikit
so tebu is definitely not bamboo
K K I'm K salah saya
I pergi sana is because
so bila I go there ah
dia kerja dekat suria is it
I tak tengok news
kalau free ke apa tengok lesung
sekarang ni I watch bara
aku rasa uh
dah ada dekat uh mobile
uh habis senang untuk kita just you know
you pay one-time fee habis senang untuk
can watch your favourite anime tapi depends ah
sometimes not all the show that you want ada dekat dalam
apa cerita you tengok dekat
yes so kadang-kadang my class start at eight
the latest that I arrive paling lambat I think pukul lapan
tapi I will try my best to come school early next time
cuba juga improve my
now I have a lot of projects so tengah nak habiskan semua
lama seh
I think nak apply kerja
susah lah nak cari duit
err bulan depan
apa-apa you cakap tadi ah
dalam masa depan pun I think will continue my studies
apa you join
tak tak tahu kenapa also I join then when I was sec three
my kawan uh all ajak me go
and that's where I grew my interest dengan rugby
I anggap rugby as a
whenever nak pergi training
so bila kaki tu injured
uh kena pergi doctor
so bila
time kecil tu my bicycle
tapi is not your normal bicycle is like
so daripada situ I pick up uh skateboarding also
so I play dengan skateboard together
tak ada break any bones because I want to continue playing
dengan skateboard and also maybe hopefully
kalau boleh lah um play rugby in another ten years
we live our life together sama-sama in dalam satu rumah happily
tapi I hope that phase three is coming soon because tak sabar nak pergi malaysia
tak mahu cakap pasal mask
then when you breathe and there's fog dekat cermin mata
I can't wear contact lens takut
my kawan like
I pun tak sabar nak uh habiskan ini COVID
ya sedih bila dengar Teo Heng is closing down
tapi um if it's not karaoke
I rasa I nak pergi main bola dengan my kawan
oh of course I want to keluar dengan my family
uh ajak dia orang pergi dinner um
you know uh pergi
tak pernah dengar pasal hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher tu boleh buat untuk staycation
dah lama plan
ease off my mind off uh jauh dari rumah at least you know
meet somewhere that macam
uh boleh relax my mind
bila I go wild wild wet
kita pergi wild wild wet but actually it's different because
kena lineup time uh the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people dekat dalam you only can go one round
boleh enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
cannot agaknya bring my girlfriend along
um actually tak pernah pergi sana but I hope to try
like just now bila
I cakap I don't like uh I mean I like heights right
I takut
bila dia tengah naik suddenly dia turun
tapi no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
ada ah similar
tapi tak boleh lah because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and nak cuba
there's satu specific
that I suka
it's a M three uh I tahu you don't like cars but
ya actually betul juga ah macam
tak tipu actually is one of my favourite
tokyo drift punya cerita uh in all the movies
kalau you percaya there's nine fast and furious movie
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so macam dah malas nak tengok
ya macam for me
macam mana I boleh suka bola like
semenjak kecil uh
semua of my family
uh yes ada baby pictures of me wearing a
actually I suka club too because of the history
uh but it's datang from a rival club ah
after like how many years dia orang menang club uh cup
um I'm not being a hater tapi macam I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
kalau tak nak pergi kerja you can always take tapi kalau dah ambil
uh pergi lah rest dekat rumah
hards hard time has to come first baru
easy life baru datang so don't expect everything to be easy
ya I get what you mean tapi
harap that everything will
and boleh dapat uh boleh dapat kerja senang
kalau boleh everybody at uh live their normal life after that
I hope that good news akan datang
kalau tak we will if orang tak uh
akan datang ah
kenapa you nak pergi sana
kenapa you think that it's a macam
macam fishy fishy stuff you know
it's cold and you uh tak tahan sejuk you know tak tahan sejuk
so you are you are telling me that kita kena shop before kita pergi korea
I the the thing is that I want to go there sebab I've been there
it's a place whereby I rasa macam
tempat ini bagus untuk bawa partner ah you know
I don't know kalau if there
they have mukshidonna there tapi
I'm not sure if you can apa
sebab kalau you nak shopping dekat sana
bawa benda bring light pack light lah you know
confirm berat
I wanna go there when it's winter tapi
I'm just afraid that kalau
you know lah kita tak tahan sejuk
I tak tahan but you know
I tak I I tak pernah experience snow you know so
mana balik singapore demam if kalau dekat sana dah sejuk obviously you
tak shiok
tak shiok lah siapa nak nak nak fall sick in on holiday seh
but I think you'll like it there lah sebab apa eh
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you pakai lah brand brand itu semua sebab
macam etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream dengan face masks very cheap there
but banyak banyak
dekat sana lebih murah lah compared to you sini ah
we concentrate on korea dulu ah apa cakap australia
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like macam
a road trip tau you know like macam you know melbourne eh like from sydney we drive down to other places
macam we get to see the apa itu
scenery twelve apostle's yang dia orang tengok itu semua
another five years I rasa sebab nak kira-kira plan dua tahun
I dengar husband dia tengah ambil
provided provided if dia masih single lah kalau dia nak kahwin might
by then dah ada anak [kan]
like for me korea I've been there so I bring you to the places that I've been there or maybe to new places that kita yang dapat tahu
I want to try actually but then I don't think it's right lah macam tak
tak boleh ah it's not halal what it's live you cannot eat that
is expensive tapi kalau if you are there you tak buat
kira macam wasted lah you dah dekat sana you dah dah all the way sampai korea abeh you tak
not just crab ah can buy lobster or ketam what
it's it's best to just splurge ah sebab dah dekat sana apa
how to play ini huh
but then I think korea tak ada korean theme park tak ada haunted house lah
I try to find macam
kalau saturday macam pergi sentosa
I will bring you somewhere ah dekat sentosa
no lah not beach lah pakai just wear casual pakai casual jer
resort world tutup kan
check apa ini
nak kena fikir plan B juga seh
last I pergi
two thousand fourteen seh yang
sakit lah
lepas pergi sea aquarium jalan dekat vivo
then beli-beli barang yang tak perlu
I don't realise ini melissa what
is it comfy tak
but I don't like the pattern dia macam pattern wak wak pergi masjid punya kind of slipper
I I saw some of my friends pakai gini ah tapi dia macam wak wak pakai so I don't like
I support no I support the idea of you nak jual
itu mask daripada you nak beli and shortlist semua benda
kalau you buy the mask I will pay for you
tak akan you
makan is because makanan dia they are selling at thirty dollars
no that's why I say you must group the order let's say macam three for eleven dollars
mahal tau you tahu kenapa tak
kalau you tengok
you tengok services of uh delivery services eh like
so berapa
but I think for the start you just buy fifty dulu ah
macam very
macam loud loud colours macam orang might think twice ah nak beli unless it's an occasion ah macam
I nikah pakai itu apa
table dah empat
your mum dah masak
okay jangan berbual dekat sini
but ya lah I have that urge to makan mamak but then again
but adam road mana got
adam road like macam boring ah
yes ada spring leaf
but depends what what time we are going there sebab
eh that time dekat rumah orang
landed property that time we go itu apa spring leaf is it
you bring me there malam-malam lah landed property
there's this kedai apa thohirah eh
you remember tak
yang macam kedai mamak atas ah
dey you lupa eh
dekat landed property
bukan beauty world eh not the beauty world one
tak tahu ah dekat around surrounding landed property ah
dia ada satu kedai mamak terselit but it's the macam spring leaf type ah I think it's spring leaf eh is it
I tak tahu you bawa kereta you bring me I tahu
but I I ingat mahal tempat dia tempat dia mahal
level mahal eh kedai mamak mahal [eh]
landed property I tak tahu dekat mana you bring me there
sebab that one dekat SAFRA macam gitu
eh I can only remember kedai mamak
surrounded by landed property that one that that point of time when you bring me there I keluar I was lost macam eh
aside from jalan kayu yang ada kedai mamak
eight thirty tak tak sempat
dekat mana banana leaf

all these auctions kan dia macam
ada orang buat yang ada macam datang dari family susah then
tapi most of the time merepek ah nonsense ah yang ada
they don't know the stuff they are selling also they just put there terus dia buka
cause I bilang zul kan zul discuss dengan I we
uh podcast ah dia sebab dia ada this a lot of content to macam talk about

but some people don't don't they look tough you know they look tough hundred percent tough tapi they don't show
itu yang buat orang macam tak nampak you know they don't see
those are yang show like I told you I have friends yang don't show
selepas ini I nak ambil wudhu I kumur-kumur ah
I should bring it's patut zul yang kena cakap dekat sini because he sounds terrible in recording

I don't want I never give him before tau dia cakap this is for his fur lah you know
dia bagi then I cakap dengan dia tak apa aku kau kau kirakan nanti aku aku bayar
some amount for the vitamin ini semua ah
because I told him I told him that I kasih dia yang
yang treats itu jer dia cakap oh treats itu untuk
nak train dia orang bukan untuk
treats itu is like to make them obey you
ah macam kucing kan suka benda itu [kan] then they will like come to you
dia jangan forget about me sudah eh that's my worst fear seh
then gini dia tampar
of course ah dia rasa
there's one video that shows that uh satu okay there's two video ah after dengan before ah there's this two cat before video
ada dua kucing then
so yang cat itu the other cat is he keeps looking for dia punya partner
macam you can see that body language dia he's like macam he feels sad ah
dia macam roaming around the house looking for the person
sebab that rumah dah used to have people
in the house what ada bunyi
lampu dia tak dapat retrieve surat
lampu dia tak dapat retrieve surat
owner should have apa
fall off sebab because of he's stressed yeah
then some more dia we never sterilize him what
itu mandi ah

actually bapa I kasih dia extra tau
nine hundred tak termasuk

malaysia baru letak
uh dua puluh lima ringgit paling murah

vitamin dia I think dalam tiga puluh lebih ada lah
not treats ah it's more like macam food lah food based ah
I tak tahu how he feed him lah
dia memang dia tahu I suruh beri dia ayam
kan I tanya dia kau ada ayam sebab kucing aku tak makan ikan
oh sebab I think
my mum kasih dia ayam goreng

that building that land is is been there for a while lah macam you know
dia dah um refurbish and upgrade is it
um when I was in school macam doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening macam at that point of time we don't feel it lah obviously cause we too young
to experience it tapi
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so macam more comfortable
ya do they still find it macam alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore macam cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me kan kalau
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself pula on my own
with my parents et cetera macam it feels very alien
I pergi tempat lain gitu it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless macam
no other places in singapore make you feel janggal like out of place except sembawang
macam you make your own decisions and stuffs
levels like what period in time of your life macam you
five years five right lima
no dark past I'm digging out from you you're safe okay tak zilch
also I think ya I think pun like for me I was in poly what so macam we were like what eighteen nineteen right
tapi kan if we were in sec four we were sixteen
you secondary school cuma
no mana boleh hey hello
apa ini okay so it's like one thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen
perk up the spirits perk up the spirits tau jangan macam gini lah
but it ya we didn't kita tak close pun anyways so macam
acquaintance too young to learn the word acquaintance back then tapi that's the fact
actually I didn't have a lot of good memories dekat
at that school also anyway pasal
I only spent two year dekat sana
oh okay I don't even know kalau ada perkataan undeniable entah eh
eh selamat hari raya
yay yay woo hari raya at home
zoom raya
okay tolong ceritakan thanks okay sounds nice woo
wait you tolong or just like help um potong-potong something oh really
wait tapi macam tapi err sometimes my my english words are limited so I'm very bad at presentations
I can I can screw up I can screw up but tadi nak cakap apa eh um ya I know very interesting right
tapi macam nasi lemak pun ada other side dishes like telur and stuff like that
abeh ada ikan bilis or
wait cucumber apa
tak apa lah it's all in the name of fun
me too yang
so you nak pakai ini forever
betul ya
I'm just looking at the list of things that I made to talk and the top of the list is holidays and what we miss about it that's the first thing that popped out of my mind oh it is don't tell me you tak rindu ke
setuju it's
you literally just nak leave singapore just for the sake of it after all this
rehat and relax at the R&R
no lah come on lah I still remember bila you go you went to malaysia with your family then suddenly last minute
kan macam out of the blue there was one time
and then macam you guys didn't have clothes additional clothes ke something like that
wait yang
right putri pacific okay okay is it the one yang betul-betul nearby where's where's the woodlands causeway itu
no I mean kalau dia orang buat polls and and surveys confirm will boom cause over there you tak payah bayar
that's the thing about your family sometimes dia orang boleh just do impromptu stuffs
tapi okay lah option one will be plane option two will be car option three will be ferry
and you know I don't really like to drive a lot so kalau you know someone
malas girl you
highway tak err there was one time we went to desaru
ya just drove sikit jer it's just a short distance
legit macam snow and driving is no easy business of the sleepy roads and everything wow
abeh it was
snowing very hard sampai kalau you stop at the traffic light kan there's no one go on um to the front mirror
and then you need to macam every rental car they provide you with a shovelish kind of thing
I hope one day I mean all these will go away lah inshallah you know just dua for the best
that much anymore macam I get so annoyed cause of him
I mean macam part of me like ya lah you have it I try to be considerate cause it's um human rights issues and racial issues tapi
but please kongsi
can do so many things wait but you do you like to watch macam broadway shows
kita orang pernah tengok kan like
so maknanya if you pergi new york you kena pergi the period yang ada comic con
kalau you pergi
if you go to the to you have go to the period yang comic con is happening kan
true that selalu bulan apa which month you haven't answer my question remember
hmm maknanya
wait do they charge people steal to like watch online ataupun everyone can just login oh so there's kind of like how does it work do they still have the panels thing and what what happens actually
because of this COVID tak ada banyak wayang movies yang keluar right so macam there's no point interviewing having a panel also
and another one is uh one the first harry potter book then like the actors of the movie or like random actors they dia orang baca buku itu
you so funny ya allah macam ugh eh dia dia dari new zealand kan
tapi macam it's like thank god
abeh dia boleh buat suara dia macam mmhmm mandolin orange oh ya that one mandolin orange was the last
talking about funny guys just now dalam kereta I heard the national day songs ini on warna

tapi honestly after listening to the game kan macam okay
pasal we grow up in the era where all the songs macam
so tak dapat
okay so okay nama aku
tahun ni is uh tiga puluh tahun ah tahun ni aku tiga puluh tahun so uh untuk aku is
macam mana nak okay okay lah err maybe before that also lah
before that aku kerja dekat public utilities board lah uh it was ya you you know ah

aku pun aku took up his advise ah
so bila-bila ah dah boring dah mendak nak mampus aku just jalan ah keluar jalan-jalan but then apa ah
after a few days pun it's the same it's the same thing
kau pun dah nothing much to do abeh ah like err after a few
weeks tak tak silap aku ada lagi satu engineer engineer ah engineer baru masuk engineer dia engineer baru ni masuk dia sekali pandang kau aku memang tahu lah dia ni engineer dia pun dari india juga ah
pasal the the the funny thing is
masuk site office eh dia duduk kat tempat yang aku duduk yang aku tidur tu
so he literally
took up my my my place ah kirakan dia macam ibarat ganti aku ah
so aku
at first bila dia dia datang like
the first few days dia masuk aku tak berbual dengan dia sangat ah pasal aku tak tahu dia engineer as in aku tahu dia engineer he was part of the company is an
employee of the company tapi aku didn't know his background so hari-hari ah
ah so hari-hari aku datang office aku tengok dia pun dia pun macam aku time baru masuk dia datang office duduk office pun duduk
so aku pun aku tanya dia ah I ah pasal
ah kita attachment semua kita nak kena err put up a report apa kita punya own individual report
so aku
ah aku pun need someone to to to give me some input ah like all these technical technical details apa kita buat apa benda yang bangla bangla
dia orang yang tengah bikin apa benda yang dia orang tengah bikin so I need someone to explain to me ah so aku tahu dia ni engineer he's part of the company tapi dia pun tak ada kerja dia pun macam aku
aku tanya dia lah aku just take the opportunity ah aku tanya excuse me are you an engineer
so that explains a lot lah kenapa dia dia macam aku duduk lepak aje tak sebab dia punya project belum start lagi so that's why the the company
I asked him to to come over to this project first sambil tunggu the his project start lah
so aku
dengar gitu aku like okay ah aku punya mind macam terus ada light bulb ah okay bagus ah aku boleh boleh apa
ah minta tolong dia untuk aku punya report ah individual report ah
terus aku aku korek ah help me tell me what is this explain to me what is that gini semua abeh dia dia bilang ah
abeh after that day onwards pun
err dia dengan aku sekaki ah err err dia pun selalu come let's go let's go out jalan-jalan err pergi keluar jalan-jalan pun ni ah jadi orang tak tak
tak tengok kita tak buat apa-apa ah ah
asal tak tidur dekat sana ada got some certain days certain days we kita ada tidur kat kat ah kat tempat situ kadang-kadang pasal we did an upgrading project in a apa
kadang-kadang pun kita ah apa jalan-jalan dalam sekolah dia kita tidur dalam classroom that was during the holidays lah so the school was empty ah
kirakan err the
dekat site eh
yang paling tinggi is only the project manager lah and project manager that time aku punya project manager perempuan so ah she also
err wasn't the the macam mana nak cakap eh ah
there there are some ladies who are macam rude ah dia orang dia orang can do both the office work and the site work tapi yang that time aku punya internship my project manager she was more of the office type lah
so dia duduk office aje ah kalau higher ups ni semua ah dia orang jarang datang site
at most pun dia orang datang ah apa once err
dia orang pun tak akan dia orang pun tak akan macam err
ya probably they want kalau dia orang pergi site pun nak tengok progress you won't go into
macam dalam-dalam ah dia orang setakat jalan dekat tepi tengok oh okay ini dah siap ini dah bangun ini dah bikin dia orang tak akan masuk like literally masuk
aku so the good thing the the engineer came aku minta dia tolong so like
aku pun help to update my my weekly report
okay lah aku
uh one good thing pun aku pun like have to be smart also lah macam aku pun tahu office orang semua
cakap aku aku datang pun tak buat apa-apa kan so bila bila this engineer dah datang aku dah dapat dia tolong uh aku punya report
so bila-bila aku nak kena bikin report aku buat dalam office ah I mean that's the only place also yang aku boleh buat apa
that's like like that's that's the only setting yang kau boleh buat kerja apa
so ada juga lah there's there's where other engineer pun start to notice ah wah dia ni ada juga ah bikin ni bikin ni buat ni semua pasal like a few weeks later ada lagi satu budak
attachment masuk
ah budak attachment ah
dia pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office pasal it's just like a very ah small ah small office
so hari-hari kau datang office eh kita masuk kita punya site office sebelum masuk kau nak kena buka kasut kau ah
so satu hari tu aku aku macam biasa report late to work
aku sampai office aku tengok kat luar pintu
pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office kau dah kau dah cam ah kau dah cam ah ah
ah ni kasut dia ni ni kasut dia tu
eh hari ni datang ada kasut baru ah ni ada budak attachment baru ke okay ah ada member ah siol aku ingatkan
local poly ke apa ah local student aku dah excited ah at least ada member eh pasal kau hari-hari kerja pun muka muka sama mendak ah
sekali aku buka pintu masuk office buda china ah siol
dia dia err and he he's he's not from a local polytechnic lah he
bukan bukan he's he's a he's he's from china tapi dia punya course is from
err err err apa ni err building construction authority kirakan macam mana nak cakap eh
ah macam
okay ah it's to put it simply macam
ah aku
aku masuk fire fire fighting apa eh
dia orang ada separate course apa fire fighting course eh macam
tapi untuk building building punya sector ah kirakan aku masuk ni course
aku dari poly tapi untuk some students hantar
ah so so okay ah dia so bila aku nampak dia alamak budak china pula eh aku ingatkan pasal kau tahu
at that aku tak tahu lah sekarang still I think now still the same tapi back then
they couldn't speak english well lah and then they they just speak mandarin to you aku pun dah ibarat macam
err apa macam ayam dengan itik ah berbual
so okay lah  aku ingatkan ah okay lah at least ni ada attachment ada budak attachment okay lah
ah err just talk ah pasal
apa everyday pun got nothing much apa so just try to strike up a conversation
err strike a conversation pun like he doesn't really understand what I'm trying to say pun aku pun tak berapa faham
aku pun tahu like he doesn't really get me so okay lah just just
just err or just hi bye gitu ah
but the funny thing was apa ni
dia lagi apa eh err
dia lagi lagi laid back dari aku ah siol
a'ah ah dia lagi lepak dari aku lah siol
dia like literally
bukan nak kata aku like the model student ah aku pun aku pun ada juga ah memang ah aku lepak ah tapi aku pun err you have to be smart ah kau tak boleh
err macam selalu err apa err
tunjuk orang kau you have to balance it out ah
macam aku bukan aku hari-hari pula err datang datang office lambat
ah so aku aku hari ever since office boy dah dah macam cover aku eh office boy dah dah macam
ah dia dah tolong tolong aku aku tiap-tiap hari datang office lambat
pasal aku tahu aku dah tahu dia punya timing bila aku datang office tak ada orang dalam office so selalu aku datang bila tak ada orang dalam office
ah ah tapi when
when it comes to bila kau nak tunjuk muka ah then kau
tunjuk muka ah
ah so you you just have to be smart about it ah tapi yang this this other guy like he literally like
err dia punya suka ah
dia ah
dia dia the good thing untuk aku aku ada orang cover aku the office boy
like you have to make you use you have to network ah you have to network you had to make connections tapi dia ni dia ni tak ada connections langsung ah ah
ah office boy approach tapi language barrier juga ah
apa dia pun in his own world even the the other engineers
the malaysian chinese enigineers pun dia orang pun cakap dia ni
apa dia ni tak boleh ah dia ni buat hal sendiri
apa so so that's that's the thing ah
that was my experience lah for my for my attachment so it was from that experience yang aku tengok
eh siala rabak apa aku tengok the working environment macam it's so stressful aku tengok the the engineer yang dari india tu kiwak muka dah macam zombie
tapi untuk aku ya aku was just a student apa so aku just report to work like the usual like eight thirty to six something like that lah aku macam mana pun
pukul enam aku chao ah pasal they they don't really have have anything much for me apa tapi like those engineers like
dia orang after six pun dia orang still
err ya so abeh aku tengok like the work environment macam
semua orang buat hal sendiri macam not much interaction
like ya it's true err aku can understand they don't take me seriously and aku pun wasn't expecting them to take me seriously ah aku kau cakap gini pun aku teringat ada satu kali tu it was the first tak silap aku the first day ah the first day
aku report to to to aku apa attachment
so kan aku bilang kau apa ni err
everyone was so busy pasal they have a meeting so after that err they all left for the meeting
aku aku seorang aje ah dalam office
aku seorang dalam office sekali alih-alih ada satu orang masuk dalam office
dia pun tengok aku dia tengok aku err tak
tak kenal aku pe macam dia ni siapa siol abeh tanya oh who are you aku cakap attachment student oh attachment student abeh dia tanya aku err singaporean ah ya singaporean
dia dia dengar singaporean terus dia straight talk direct direct punya siol
you singaporean why you take this course singaporean where where want to work in construction one work under the hot sun work under the hot sun ini semua gedebak gedebuk kiwak aku dengar terus down siol serious aku dengar terus down
tapi ah ah tapi ya lah apa that was
I was still young ah you you you didn't really understand it lah tapi bila dah lama kau dah ini kau dah kerja kau dah in the industry eh
so apa ya so
after the experience aku was like siala gini rabak pe err
so err err lepas bila aku tu tu yang aku pun make me
fikir ah I like aku betul like sial ah betul ke nak kerja err construction industry rabak gini
tapi at that at that at that time pun macam abeh kalau aku tak nak kerja construction industry pun aku nak kerja apa sia
abeh aku fikir-fikir abeh aku dah belajar ambil diploma ni pun dah dah dah tiga tahun takkan nak
okay lah cakap dengan diri
aku even though aku
aku still don't know what to do with my life since aku already have this diploma which already err took up three years of my life okay lah I just just might as well take up a job
aku ya aku applied for
which I applied ah ni I applied the stat boards public utilities board ni semua so okay lah alhamdulillah err within one or two weeks they get back to me and aku got the job quite quite fast ah
um ya apa time aku
ya bila aku dapat kerja pun like
pasal like err when I join the company
then they because it's a big company apa so they have this apa induction course ah
it's no longer your your your age age age group ah so you meet all kinds of people lah abeh abeh jumpa abang-abang ni semua apa
oh engkau umur berapa
ah ya ya around your age ah oh muda lagi ni kau punya ni kau punya ah first kerja aku cakap a'ah
oh apa kau patut
err muda-muda patut kerja luar dulu kerja private apa rasa dia punya susah payah dulu err kau dah kau dah tahu dia punya susah payah baru kau masuk
baru kau masuk err
government state board ni semua you know lah because they see government iron rice bowl which is true lah definitely I I won't I won't a dispute that ah
and uh so when they when they say that aku pun like eh
alamak aku pun did I make the right move ke tak eh err err like
you were saying ah kau
a fresh fresh graduate baru baru baru baru graduate ini semua kau patut
err kirakan start from the bottom ah start from scratch
bila aku happy kerja
and aku pun so it it gave me like
err doubts lah aku pun like
did I make the right move ke tak eh
tapi I mean
apa it doesn't really matter also lah
just went along lah abeh macam
aku pun fikir balik like
err ya what he say really err apa like
ah tak bedek ah but
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks ah abeh aku pun fikir balik macam sial ah aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak resign oh just
because aku nak nak nak listen to that guy kan
uh apa uh
I mean apa you
you just made do with what you have ah you just make do with what you have memang betul
apa the the at that at that time my my nature of work
err apa
it didn't turn out quite that bad also pasal
macam you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants ah so
abeh err from
from aku punya nature of work pun project management pun what what I
back then pun aku wasn't really a
a a apa ni I'm
I am a very quiet guy lah aku not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
so so ya you aku aku
improve on my soft skills and then dekat err during my course of work pun there like what I told you ah who decided to further my studies take up
like I told you before lah apa aku time ambil degree pun was like
doing a degree I should also do a degree tapi
uh aku was just following the trend ah tapi now now aku fikir balik I shouldn't have do that lah I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
and uh what you really want to do ah pasal that time
apa err
since you say it like that pada aku in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in ah so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay um which I agree lah which a degree is not really ah apa a need ah
when aku did my degree uh
err aku did my degree while while working kan abeh as years go by eh
aku kat kerja aku like
aku tengok aku punya sama ah like
work environment pun
aku tell myself sial ah aku aku aku don't see myself
aku tengok aku punya bosses eh like
macam err
dia orang ada takde pun macam beza sia
like they are just like pasal okay
organisation kan like ya we have a apa like uh
tapi stat board they call it lah
when kau pun pun you should know ah kan hierarchy ah it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like abeh macam
kau kat bawah eh macam
tak boleh buat decision abeh kau nak kena
err lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena
abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu decision orang atas dia lagi
I mean kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka
like apa sia ni like
kau orang err kau orang cannot make a decision abeh aku nak kena buat apa siol
bertahun-tahun lepas punya sia
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like eh siala kau orang dari dulu eh abeh sampai sekarang
more like pada aku it's not healthy ah abeh abeh macam aku like kat situ eh aku kerja situ like siala macam aku kalau stay sini aku tak nak sia end up macam kau orang ya I mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true ah aku
dispute it lah apa err government really iron rice bowl lah as in like
but aku just don't see myself doing that long term ah
to to change line ah aku decided to go into aku wanted to do media so
err after my apa ni err my degree ended
aku graduated
aku took out a course dekat mediacorp
at first aku didn't know about it also like as in I I do
ah apa sebelum aku enroll under mediacorp
ya I I did some I did some research ah of courses of media courses ah apa that's where aku like macam aku menyesal lah siala like instead of me doing this degree in project management I should have like straightaway
it's good lah it's good lah uh so aku was like err apa siala aku tahu dulu aku
and then apa that was
this school ah aku dah aku dah lupa ah nama sekolah dia ke something like that it was it is it closed down already ah
ah something like that ah aku pun dah lupa ah
then apa ni so aku just still err
to go ahead with it aku look up ada ada aku aku just look up on google lah of of ah media courses ah abeh aku fikir balik ah macam
aku baru habis aku punya part-time degree aku did my part-time degree for five years
aku dah like that five years eh aku pun like like like macam in a way like macam drag myself to to finish it ah
abeh err
lepas tu aku sekarang nak go into media industry kalau aku nak ambil degree aku nak kena
aku was like siala five years of study dah dah macam dah cukup ah like ah enough of studying ah sia ah enough of studying ah I mean
ah abeh
aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak take up another degree
another three years of degree for media abeh aku just look out aku tengok mediacorp offer offer
this is but it's a diploma ah it's just a one year course okay lah one year aku cakap dengan dia okay lah masih boleh take it lah one year okay lah so I I I I grabbed it ah
then err aku pun
transition into the media industry kan so aku like thought of err maybe err take a gap year first ah before aku joined the media industry
so uh apa aku
was planning to take my gap year which was this year aku uh already plan to go to new zealand
a working holiday if you heard of it ah basically I basically it's it's a holiday tapi ah
kau boleh you can apply for a job there
but ah but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs lah it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs ataupun part-time jobs are those kind of jobs ah ya ah so
so err apa ni err
kalau there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
pasal ah their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they make use of this err apa ni err backpackers foreigners to come to to to err holiday
and err at the same time these people need money to continue their holiday apa so they make use of this people to work in the horticulture industry ah so aku
aku dah plan ah aku dah book aku apa flight semua aku dah aku dah err dah dapat dah visa aku dah apa ni err aku dah apply deferment pun untuk aku punya
semua dah settle semua dah swee tinggal nak
nak ni je nak naik flight jer
ya I mean it's it's it's predictable lah apa aku punya kerja pula aku nak kena bagi one month notice so err apa ah
aku decided to like literally ah resign err one month before aku punya flight ah aku tak nak resign too early pasal aku pun need the money lah
I have over there apa
so aku pun decided to like just err retire one month before my flight
aku was seriously like the the suspense eh was like wow like only
apa err
when the news all broke out oh apa COVID
ni semua apa ah
at first macam the whole the whole world were were singing praises for singapore oh singapore have their best system they have the best ini itu ini semua gedebak gedebuk tapi aku dalam hati macam okay lah aku harap that like
err maybe err new zealand they dia orang like closed one eye on singapore because
kononnya singapore have a very good system in controlling the the virus they will still allow err err visitors to come over lah
sekali but unfortunately that
did not happen ah aku punya
ah apa
ah three weeks before my flight ah so at that time when they announced that aku dah already tender my notice aku dah resign pun
ah abeh like fuck man at that time like siala macam damn when when when that news came out eh aku rasa macam like like rasa macam bodoh ah like ah
not really cheated macam
ya ya ya err abeh macam
betul lah I mean
it's not my fault tapi like I really felt stupid at that time ah macam damn like like aku like aku pun dah bilang err aku punya boss semua like aku didn't like literally at my workplace inform all my colleagues oh I'm going new zealand ni semua like macam macam excitingly like break the news to them ah
aku like just keep it to myself lah tapi of course dengan aku punya boss aku nak kena bilang dia apa aku aku nak resign ni semua
abeh boss aku pun of course they they dia orang pun tanya aku kau betul ke nak resign apa ah
at that time pun pernah tanya aku if aku nak reconsider ke tak resignation aku aku cakap tak ah aku still want to go ahead
he respect my decision ah dia cakap okay ah this is your decision I fully respect your decision if you really want to go you just go ahead lah okay lah so when the news broke out that new zealand they close the borders aku like fuck man like siala ah
dah aku dah tender aku punya resignation abeh semua dah dah dah settle flights semua dah settle logistics semua settle
habis sekarang tak jadi eh aku dah then err the the other things that came into my mind ni ah sekarang macam mana takde kerja takde kerja abeh like
tak dapat pergi like a lot of things came into my mind ah
apa like
at that time was like really down ah really down abeh ah
aku didn't work for four months
ya ah apa
ah kau cakap pasal tu pun err apa
was at its peak ah aku punya office dalam office aku tu that same floor one of the one of the office lady
okay lah quite close so at that time pun like eh siala macam
err apa a lot of err uncertainty a lot of
err suspense ah like eh macam mana ni eh apa aku pun risau aku pun takut jangan aku positive sudah abeh nanti aku tak dapat pergi like you have
ah nasib baik ya lah eventually the lady she recovered from COVID and none of the office staff on my floor were tested positive also lah as in we we didn't we we didn't have to at that time belum ada swab test ah
so anytime we just ah apa do uh uh fourteen day quarantine at home
so uh alhamdulillah tak ada apa-apa
aku resign then aku didn't work for four months the first two months aku like literally like
lepak kat rumah ah aku like literally no mood ah aku just err err new zealand tak jadi kan ah just duduk rumah ah aku aku like laze laze around at home ah
how cause I very like macam my friends also like I buka ah
continue ah your story curi how how did he get away with that
the audacity adik curi daripada bapa
macam mana you dapat though
I think some kedai like some shop they will ask some shops tak kesah that one best kalau like if your muka then they like ya ambil lah wah
how I cannot I don't know like I got like macam masih you know ya
like I go I my I sprained my ankle then got like headline fracture then I kind of cannot play sports now then like I feel very insecure like you know because the thing is right macam pasal body like when you are like bigger in size but then you you play sports or what but then when you play sports what did I say oh ya then I stop ah cause I fracture then like the thing is like you know when you are bigger in size
and then but then like when you tak buat apa-apa then like they will just keep on attacking you the same you know like just now we talked about all the aunties seventy year old is like what the hell dude but then you like when you have something macam like if you dance dance is also a sport right or play other sports they will like not say or like you can will just skip one or thirty you wanted to say you know like just now we talk about
say something back but then ya makcik makcik sekarang tak tahu like ya they not it's like bukan tegur it's like menyindir then I'm like wow oh really ah your parents like that
especially in front of other relatives tu aku sakit hati betul oh my god correct not even secretly that is oh my god ya
I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them nak kereta I mean like ya oh sorry I don't know what I mean I don't understand like
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry ah I quite shocked ah but alhamdulillah at least he got there I mean macam token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just risau then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior macam tukar macam sergeant kau then kalau nak buat benda like he can macam threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can macam move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you nampak the news baru keluar like ah this chinese man
dia freaking like molest budak kecil perempuan and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is macam kalau nak cakap pasal sexual cases like harassment kat singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of para muslim say that like alah but then like maki alah also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism macam dia tak nak apa-apa religion at all kat dalam dia orang country or tak nak individualism kat dalam country dia orang also dia orang tak nak ah tudung semua tak nak which I don't understand because other people from other religion macam nuns tu semua
because they tutup also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya dia kata dia tak suka hijab cause we look scary
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot lah macam aku boleh err macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant dia orang tak kesah but the thing is even if you tak kesah or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need oh really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
ya I think cause of our agama also cause you know nabi muhammad he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot agama and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world kita dalam bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so selesa and comfortable dalam singapore then when you like tak kesah
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and apa lagi like just perangai dia orang ah I'm wanna believe is adolescence but macam bodoh apa like kalau kau tengok balik they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of mak minah scares me ya scare me like dulu dulu is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion ah tapi sekarang macam I see them like throwing maki ah mak kau
mak kau ya is just uncomfortable lah to tengok like the younger generation
is very sedih ya macam kalau cause the thing is um like the older generation tak nak pergi I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we kalau kau tengok the younger generation aku macam err like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
apa dia buat ni ah
honestly I don't even think you are a minah you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they fikir just because then they feel macam
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something ah is not even tegur is like sindir like asal kau I'm like um sorry sally like like you know like asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau I'm like um I'm trying my best you know like the way they tegur is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to jaga hati or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you ungkitkan balik I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context macam apa ni bodoh like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit ah a bit sometimes they a bit too proud ah of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up macam dulu aku kecil-kecil how ah I don't know lah
wow congratulations wow masuk jannah esok but I've met some people that dia orang err like hafal al quran all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I tersinggung sikit sebab I tak boleh hafal but like you know there's no need to
I come after you eh aku baru habis khatam tau kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam like wow and usually is like not saying what ah but is the madrasah kids pun macam gitu ya and then they
eh I don't know cakap bahasa arab aku macam okay thanks oh my god ya oh my god ya is it like sometimes aku like just fikir and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by cemburu or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like macam it just like sakit hati the way they talk to us is like that
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you khatam like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang not even about quran or what like just in life general macam
dia lari empat round you you baru lari dua round then you just say oh I finished eight rounds macam gitu you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang vlogging vlogging tu kan okay
I only have one girl friend that ada lesen motor and she bawa scooter ya comel bodoh and is very is the lah like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that ah
okay sorry I didn't know it's comel at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like hujan a bit difficult though ya mm ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the besar one just like five K starting price
wow dah fikir jauh sister
mm ah inshallah actually study like last month you know COVID COVID the thirty five guest should have went for it lagi murah really I have like some friends and cousins actually only a friend and two cousins
kahwin during so they only invite dua puluh lima orang then the others like online it was like cheap not cheap ah but like compared to what the malays you know malay weddings are so expensive sis you dah save you wanted to get married twenty two
kalau ada jodoh then it will happen
but wow I'm betul-betul cannot believe that you like dah plan I'm like wow cause like bila cakap online like you're eighteen I'm like cool she's still a student too I'm like she's still around that eighteen age wow
wait you ambil berapa course kat mana how much is it ah I heard private course like expensive what did you sit for like apa you belajar
same same industry also um how you cari course like this oh
but I think like your course and dia punya timing betul-betul chun like cause of the pandemic betul-betul cari like orang apa ni like healthcare people ya they cari ya ya so that was the timing was nice but the pandemic no lah
tak nak try hospital like oh okay okay
oh that's a bit leceh
untuk kahwin okay okay sorry sorry
is he oh no not reservist right oh okay okay sorry sorry I mean how old is your that one oh okay okay kat tekong
yeah oh okay is that a lot I have friends that habis satu kotak like one kotak per day like how what the fuck oh wow isn't it like mahal because I have friends also they pokgai pun masih nak beli rokok
ya then kalau tak pinjam I don't understand the
pinjaming the satu batang satu batang thing it's so funny like halfway through class satu batang K minggu depan okay
cause like my family is don't smoke like my parents tak smoke langsung then when I masuk poly then I'm like to me culture shock cause um none of my friends like close friends smoke but poly oh my god everybody whenever you turn somebody is smoking and like
wow aku macam quite shock nampak dia orang as kelakar to me but like to them is a norm but dah biasa is so cute like minggu depan aku bagi kau balik like wow
comel that's legit selling seh I never see the photo legit wow smart smart no ah no lah
oh my god then they tell the anak-anak look down look down lower your gaze tutup mata scary seh oh man ya
I know some girl friends will be like chill sister I do not want your mat tahir
anak siapa tu astaga
same like like rilek-rilek ya ya macam sendu ours apa sia minah-minah ni
then like they refunded to me aku malas nak register balik and then now online registration got registration fee like online fee I think it's like three dollars or four dollars aku macam I don't want lah I gemar cara
but private mahal ya motorbike but actually I learn how to I don't think is illegal cause my family has like houses like in indonesia then we also have family there then sometimes we just ride the motor there like they teach us lah so technically
I can bawa already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who takde lesen then they just bawa motor they just bawa as long as you tak kena tangkap
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends lah like you know they just bawa takde lesen as long as you tak tangkap is okay takut risky
no but you can beli motor tak lesen
can like my friend no err family member that can pay you see my friend um jual his motor to this kid he haven't even get his license
then he dah dah letak nama dia bayar dah dah ambil dah budak tu I don't know if he has his license already lah but at first when he beli takde I don't know how he gonna learn also cause of like circuit breaker last time but at least he is learning now
but ya but don't lah don't it's illegal illegal don't do illegal things you smoke like cold or hot ya I can smell it why honestly bila my friends cakap pasal ni aku tak but they said got the feeling the feeling
they said hot sakit berat berat is it what you say heavier ah
but you know one brand like gudang garam that one like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like bawa ke sekolah and then they spread ah ya like I don't know how they supply dapat like that day budak ni bawa tu macam
you know when they jual it then that thing you know then dia kasi kasi orang I don't know if they beli or what ah but I'm just like very curious macam mana korang dapat ni semua especially when they are underage and then beli
I mean eh that's a huge flex eh you want to like minum bandung I want to drink bandung in bandung like wow I mean if
you had the money like takde feeling there ah makan french fries kat singapore
you want like just keep quiet right and then tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang why is it quiet ah
kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba like ah budak ni tak nak kasi duit mm mm inshallah
kasi surprised kasi us another surprise
tapi feel like banyak though on the other side apa sia budak-budak ni
I mean who doesn't duit tu siapa tak nak though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche semua nak buat like orang cina-cina you know like the youtubers siapa ni I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel lah in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast melayu like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start ah then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know err malay podcast usually talk about agama like a lot of it
I pusing so no lah eh I only ever seen like those ya but that one is like tiga puluh sen like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that one you pass around your friends
lighter kau ada lighter tak lighter aku dah habis ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but aku tak dengar banyak macam success story for melayu that's like wow you know
mm I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya untuk anjing ah I mean that's for them ah that's a niche for them but like aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya community diam jer
kan kan aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan though
no I think like when we send it to them then dia orang akan dengar and I think cause cause the video they show dalam form like changing changing the code switching that one I think they akan belajar to like analyse the way we cakap
interesting ah macam I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit lah how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like campur is usually one one like ya around me lah is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the bahasa ibunda I'm like bro
ya betul betul
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore hijab
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered bak kwa before I'm like 我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren no bak kwa for me no oink oink for me sweetie
but like the err chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if kalau tu bukan apa ni reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course
uh twenty nine but I tak terjun botol punya orang sebab I I don't know because that time I rasa macam I terjun botol when you actually uh proposed to me right I rasa macam like the happiest girl on earth lor then macam
macam semak because the thing is that um it's not very often for me to get um
I don't have boyfriends before I have like boyfriends like macam those people who idiots people lah but then uh
ya so our age was catching up so we feel like we old wah sudah tua mahu kahwin lagi ha ya so
I rasa macam I think this the right time for us to get married
but remember that time we kena kena tipu
the for our kad jemputan
to your mother also lah from actually stopped me also mak mak stopped me
I actually oh the next one the problem was uh the kalau the tak nak nyanyi eh tak nak show up we got the best tau he's the funniest guy the funniest guy ya quite popular he's she's actually
huh ya he want to back out because he said something like he not agree with the with the caterer lah then that caterer also say um I don't know lah he's like that lah the perangai macam apa lah gitu so I was like macam ah merepek seh perangai
ya attitude then ya I was like you're funny but then still attitude macam siak so macam uh eventually I
call I I try to find kat facebook tengok ada tak siapa-siapa so I found
then that kan so all the lagu semua lah ada lagu melayu semua all mesti ada dah ada pun dah bagus uh baju semua awesome but the only thing that I scared for all the weddings right
the whatever kan semua tak show up tak apa tapi caterer kalau tak show up wah
my mum will go crazy because the thing is that makanan apa kan ha orang datang tak ada makanan nak kasih apa maggi mee
ya macam lah
ya I mean um he he dia very professional lah professional dia tahu macam mana nak berbual dia tahu and dia tak ada macam menyakiti siapa-siapa di hati pun for ah because the reason is that my mum is under religious punya school studies so kalau
so kalau cikgu macam ada cikgu-cikgu ke ustazah-ustazah datang nanti my mum was like eh don't open like all these kind of song ah
ha so macam he understand like throughout truly lah everything semua dia faham semua so the was good
uh eventually the wedding turn out good and also caterer datang we got our photoshoot photographs semua
but eventually the only thing that we don't get back is yes kita punya video tak dapat balik so orang lain um tunjukkan video kat facebook after like what
two weeks kita sampai sekarang belum lagi tunjukkan video because we do not have the video ya we want to do again
yes correct then the things that bila I that's when I found out that macam
um actually I don't really care lah that's it's correct lah macam sedih kita tak dapat video tapi at that same time I say
video could be just a story then tapi I nak cerita I dengan you like forever punya cerita video so I say okay
I want to get my own video tapi sampai sekarang masih belum buat because my computer very slow
ya I know banyak tapi video um computer slow the things that all nak kena tunggu the computer baru datang baru boleh buat
ya the cuaca was nice because dia tak hujan tapi dia tak panas pun so it was just that perfect moment
but for me I have regret I have like a lot of regrets actually for the wedding um because that wedding kan um I like my wedding betul but
back then I would actually definitely go to orange ballroom orange ballroom punya wedding right is like terbaik ah pada I um shout to shah ibrahim he make it like macam it's like a hotel
tapi still macam tak hotel juga parking is the perfect place to park the car because apa ni kat mana eh
kan tanjong katong complex yes so that place was macam tanjong katong complex where dia punya
um what is called ya mm ya dia punya parking is open space it's there's lot of parking kalau tak ada parking pun you can still park at wisma you can still park at
hooga eh salah group punya side banyak tempat untuk you nak park secondly aircon
ya that time was like the aircon was best and then dia punya makanan and then when I ask my friend because um I think a lot of people already three of my friends already get married there semua cakap makan and everything is just cost like less eh
ya about thousand a thousand people also so it's like macam that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding I mean it was like macam if I was married on that time right then it'll be nice lah cuma one thing about bad about that place it's not bad lah I say macam
not that fantastic about that place is just that dia punya tempat nak tukar baju and everything mm
ah yes because the things that macam okay for
all malay wedding as what we know as apa kita tahu kan mesti nak kena berapa banyak kali
ya around two to three right uh some ours was three ya ours was three eh no the sanding was two and then the nikah was one but nikah was a day before
so macam kita kita macam wah get married and then ah one thing about ya that one is just that ah
and then dapat hotel semua my friend actually uh because of that it actually slow down the the wedding process lah like macam because wedding malay weddings like kelam-kabut nak mampus leh bukan bukan uh macam jauh ah ah macam
bila you dah you nak tukar baju kan lepas tu you nak kena pergi patah balik kat tempat sanding
sekali macam you nak kena naik kereta go to the hotel just to tukar baju and then go back there so macam ah traffic and then campur you nak kena make up semua and then nak kena pakai baju semua so eventually that one ah take process up to two to three hours eh
the hours eh maybe along the way do you figure at know criteria was amended to alah dah cukup datang
tak lah tak juga pasal kalau nak buat photoshoot tak ada time mesti orang nak ambil gambar lagi kan ha semua orang nak ambil gambar that time semua ha selit sikit
sikit ah sikit jer tapi that's the only macam if for orange ballroom ah but then if I would go I will still do at orange ballroom then who knows maybe our ten year anniversary kita buat wedding lagi
and another thing is inviting people that I don't like this is my mum punya dia akan suka okay about malay wedding eh
you will always invite those people who either you like or you don't like or terpaksa like
because these people are like somehow somewhat related to you I remember there's this one makcik when my mum actually invited her to our wedding she was like eh you got child ni you got child some more ah
walao I was like macam eh nak eh kelakar lah makcik ni
a lot of the the cousin after that right like after my first cousin usually dia orang cuma ingat yang my mum cuma ada my brother and sister my kakak lah
cause my brother my kakak is the only people who are like macam
terserlah I me and my adik kita orang macam relax ah kita orang relax chill lepak bro tak buat apa-apa semua kita relax tak macam
my sister and my brother ha kita memang low profile relax ah relax like like you juga kan you pun relax tak buat apa-apa juga macam
ya lah tapi that time uh
we did say to uh my sister did say back because my sister was there I wasn't there kalau I was there macam over
so confirm I dah gaduh dengan dia lah tapi dah tak uh tapi K what if K takpe next question uh just asking you what is the luckiest or like macam you rasa macam
um thank god that time one one thing is the cuaca kan cuaca cuaca was like perfect ah okay then another thing apa yang you suka pasal that wedding
the other guy I mean my friend punya
I feel like macam that is the most the best thing ah of my wedding the food was nice also sadly ya
it's not about tak boleh makan or can makan also it's all about like
picture perfect I don't know ah maybe maybe it's not something to regret now actually ah menyesal sekarang pun tak guna tapi
mm tak ha dah kahwin pun ha tapi um
talking about rewind also ya if can rewind this is all the things I want to do lah tapi macam
macam kalau tak then I I I I still okay so takpe okay so nevermind let's move to marriage life okay
lepas kita kahwin lepas kita kahwin I dapat tahu yang perangai macam mana I dapat tahu macam mana you punya cara you everything I learn throughout the five years
because okay but this is what my one of my makcik cakap auntie lisa lah she told me that
orang ketiga ke apa alhamdulillah I'm so happy I'm so thankful that there's no orang ketiga
it's almost six years already um we are not uh blessed with a child yet but no matter what I'm still blessed with uh being with you lah okay so um tapi kan I nak tanya you what was on your mind
okay uh bila you dah kahwin okay once you dah habis
all the nikah right and then um all the sanding semua dah habis kan and then outside then um kat dalam bilik dah makcik-makcik semua dah balik dah mandi dah siap semua nak tidur kan
but what was on your mind eh dalam otak you tu apa you fikir macam it was for me like I fikir macam eh aku dah kahwin lah seh
aku dah aku dah I'm like all these responsibilities macam fuh dah jatuh kat kat I lah then I rasa macam eh I dah kahwin eh like like really I dah kahwin eh I tak sangka I dah kahwin and then ah so I was like macam okay takpe lek even even like few days like after the wedding
when I want when I woke up right I can't believe there's someone there's a guy beside me I was like I actually about to shout there lepas tu macam oh wait wait wait kau dah kahwin
okay so that was like uh that but it wasn't a big thing yet ah ah but for you what what's on your mind bila
you bila all this dah habis kan and the sanding part semua dah habis what's on your mind from your like marriage kind of thing
ya then like because the thing is that uh okay regarding about the call right dia macam mana tau
because the thing is that kalau you call because where I'm living alone I don't have anything like to even as your mum also she be more worried like if like the father your father is he at home ke tak
ah not because um curang ke apa lah ha but it's more to like macam um like you pukul berapa nak balik I mean like worried tau worried uh you you also did because the thing is that
bila I dah jadi isteri
where are you tu semua and stuff like that then it's like also one another thing is that I'm alone at home anything that can happen like macam kalau malam alone not that good lah kan cause it's like macam
I can't say that the neighbourhood is actually quite good lah thank god we've got a good neighbourhood ah but no people like any tom dick or harry ke apa ke you call dia orang nak strike strike malam apa betul tak
ha so I tak suka lah kan
then um so another thing is like respect lah also then when you respect my decision of talking you I mean telling you ah bila eh you ni bila nak balik ni semua then you respond okay at least I know actually I just need a respond that's all
ya tapi there's the I mean mostly you like about that lah ah but one thing about him like you tak kasih I you kasih I bebas
kebebasan also so I rasa macam happy lah ha so ya that was why ya okay that was on your mind lah like responsibilities and stuff like that also right
okay so the next one is like what you enjoy on this marriage and everything what thing I enjoy right and I found out lah yang kita ni ada banyak kesamaan in terms of like movies
ya and then like macam movie macam
some movies of course they some movies that you don't like macam harry potter you don't like tapi um lord of the ring you like and then
err so macam okay lah give and take ah stuff like that uh then but then but the most thing that we enjoy
jap at that time you belum apa at least one time only but the thing is that when that day that time happened right
meticulous lah macam semua benda I mesti macam make sure that everything eh mesti macam
goes well lah uh because I punya orang tak macam itu tau I punya orang tak macam eh tak jadi pergi sini ah pasal ah due to this and that and this and that I rasa macam I rasa risau ha but I think that time
I I say to myself maybe there's a reason why I'm not supposed to go there but eventually on that day eh kita macam eh on that time we actually had fun eh ha better correct we we had even more because it was impromptu macam tak plan apa and lepas tu kita terus like uh okay just dive ah
kita pergi cameron and port dickson
duit ada so I macam okay I terjun jer ah ha so it was macam it was fun lah it was fun kita pergi honeymoon tu semua and then we get to know each other we eventually we get to know more about each other then uh travel then
uh then he he can drive well ha naik atas semua and then because that one also is my first time I went out to um holiday without my parents in my whole entire life
I have always travelled with my parents I never like travel alone ke pergi dengan kawan ke or pergi
dengan boyfriend apa tak pernah my my travel is usually just my parents so usually like
the hotel tickets semua kan orang lain dah siapkan dah
tapi kan ah but one thing is just like it's just fun lah tapi it's it's one thing like I feel like macam wah dah dah start into responsibility end up okay dah tahu macam mana nak book hotel tu semua lepas tu dah tak tak habis-habis stop tak asyik book hotel jer nak pergi holiday jer
actually ada banyak juga for bandung but ada tapi kita tak tak venture ke sana lah
I regret tak kumpul duit banyak-banyak lepas tu kahwin but then again I rasa this is still the right time because the thing is that
ah macam kita tak boleh buat macam uh and then um but then again after I dah berapa tahun yang I realised that
I shouldn't rely on people punya kind of marriage and my kind of marriage cause
I find that because I rasa kan the time I I
I macam suka ikut-ikut orang ah macam oh dia ni ada bag dior I pun nak bag ah yang I nak pun nak I I pun nak pergi makan kat sini makan kat cafe ni semua but then after awhile then I realise
I think it's not supposed to be our kind of wedding lah our wedding supposed to be like macam our kind of marriage is supposed to be something that is just us
like a lot of my friends success friends so one thing about them is that that dia orang suka um
cause of course I know I got lot of flaws also and hey you jangan cakap you pun tak ada flaws gitu eh ha tapi macam like
you you got any regrets of the marriage itself like for example kan macam kalau dulu you tahu kalau before kahwin kan uh kalau kalau tak kalau you kahwin you can play endless car ke apa kan freedom yes you are the freedom to do whatever you want to meet your friends also have can anything but um
after marriage maybe you find like macam oh nak kena layan dia ni lah nak nak kena pergi sini nak pergi sana I cannot do my stuff and stuff like that do you have any regrets ah
but do you have any regrets of marriage not wedding oh macam sekarang ha macam for me kan I tak regret
okay because I I'm okay with marriage but uh macam being
but I know that there's certain things that I cannot do when I'm married ah ah but one thing about you you don't you don't let macam ah give me to kongkong you know macam like
I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do that kan ha tapi you kasih I freedom of what to do like for example even this uh recording screen ke apa ke
some people will find it macam the guys don't let like like you know they don't let the wife do this and stuff like that some
find that if the the lady wanted to do business or what the guy don't give ha so macam it's a lot of things like like the guys don't really macam into it lah
ha cakap nanti berselerak lah apa lah
ya kemas tu tapi macam tak boleh macam marah lah kan so so eventually macam not all guys can actually accept this ah so actually one thing I I happy lah I dapat kahwin dengan you so I happy that this thing doesn't occur to me much
which I find it macam funny ah because that time I wasn't planning mah to get married so after get married this guy wasn't like really thinking eh this guy okay or not ha
I I tak boleh seh kalau you cheat I cannot like if you cheat like
ha if you do have another girl outside or what then um that was one of my biggest fear lah I have I don't have like small small fear but then macam that one I think that if that happen terus cut ah
ah and also pukul lah but then I there wasn't any hit or anything ah I'm I'm still as fluffy as possible but then I'm not a bruises or anything lah uh so um okay for you is there any biggest fear about this marriage
uh like for example anything ah that you think like ada ke apa biggest fear lah
some in-laws lah kalau there is I is not pretty and the in-laws don't accept which is to me macam I I that's one of my fear like when I get to know your mum ke apa and then your mum don't like me akan cakap eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni sia eh sorry sorry I didn't your mum won't say like that
anyway like eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni ha dah lah gemuk tak lawa tu semua but then it's like
not like that ah your your parents are not like that ya they are very welcoming and they are and we actually did slept before waiting out we did actually um uh apa ni tinggal kat rumah mak mertua so we were like
featuring guest lah kalau you nak uh
six years and then macam kalau you want to have another what what what is your no request lah what is your future plans for the next four years before we step into that ten year punya anniversary ya
ha to join us apa semua tu so I wish that kita our financial also is doing good and everything and then um healthier family and also um slimmer but until now also dah five years also still not slim so
ya lah takde lah just just saying only
uh I'll tell you a bit about myself ah I'm uh married  ada empat anak

that the good thing about that area is all  semua connected by train
ya so  kita just  naik the train from paris you go all the way to brussels
then spend half a day there then  patah balik
um then from there I actually we actually went to  apa ni manchester tengok bola ya I'm a big big fan lah
I will I will never leave I will never leave ah london without going to manchester and watching one game oh okay talking about that my profile photo  yang uh  tengah main bola lah  tu kan
uh  dulu Uber was in singapore
uh they have competition they said ah okay you answer a few questions and you win a a jersey man U jersey okay lah then I just enter lah I just enter and on the um the Uber app just enter my name my details so that uh was in the morning on on the work day ah so lunch time lunch time I  keluar makan dengan my colleague
then  tengah makan then  ada orang call  cakap uh hi mister alif uh I'm I'm calling from Uber uh you entered the competition

 macam mana eh  nak kalau ah dah eh  kalau salah salah tak dapat apa-apa buang masa kan ah then ah  cakap okay lah nevermind ya ya ah
then I saw on this cardboard ah gambar manchester  gambar of the city and then they on the bottom they said you are going to manchester
ah then I was dah stun ah  tengok dalam hati
 apa ni takde benda apa macam ingat macam boot or apa ah player one of the player sign the boot or something because is is like a shoebox size
 bukak cardboard  apa itu aja but it didn't hit me you know I was was waiting  macam very slow reaction was like
what like  terus dah  terlompat-lompat kat situ
so is a is a is a is a um fully paid trip for seven days  pergi uh their
stadium  jumpa the player  pergi their training ground ah everything was
a fan lah ah so so that photo was actually  kat the their  apa ni training training ground their training ground so we we had a a a small football tournament between the winners from other countries
okay uh can no worries I I'll arrange everything so I went back to  kerja they are but said this was during lunch time so  lambat ah so I went back to  kerja I went to my manager lah first she look at me alif where have you been K ah I have a very cool story to tell you you're not gonna believe it but
you have to believe it I it happen lah so I told her the whole story lah then after like ten minutes of talking to her  dia cakap alif  kalau dah  lambat cakap aja lambat tak payah come up with all these stories
 cakap ah are you sure
so ah I just had that as my proof so-called proof so I  balik I told my wife my wife  pun tak percaya
then the the whole night I was waiting at my email reflect reflect check check check then about two three in the morning an email came in and it's the confirmation lah everything lah they need my detail passport  apa semua
I woke my wife ah you see you see  tengok see is real I'm not lying I'm not dreaming is real

we so we we went for one week lah that was time of my life man ya  jumpa
player free travel free hotel everything I just need to spend  duit belanja lah
from from mana ah ah
if central central paris ke the outskirts
ah ah ah okay the  ada eiffel tower
that that that time we  kita pergi night train from london
so  kita jalan lah  jalan around the area
jalan from the train the the
train  semua what what's the train say the
ah  jalan through the streets know sightseeing always  sampai the
um yup then some ya pernah but okay lah they are they are okay ah
then from there ah yup ah  satu naik stroller ah  satu the the smallest one ah ah mm
ya ya ya ya banyak halal ya ya correct
 dari from  apa ni the loop  kita naik dia ada apa the the river tour eh
ah river tour the the sand sand river all that  semua ah ah
ah ya ya ah ah we are  kita punya is just the the sightseeing just the  duduk-duduk tengok-tengok
ah then then  situ kira macam rest lah
we still have the picture the exact same picture that uh it was that was on the news  yang dah  terbakar
architecture we ah  kita kita jalan ah all the way  jalan
apa from from gare du nord  jalan around the area
the english guys oh  paris is dirty but to me  dua-dua equally dirty the difference is paris has ah more sightseeing places
the the  dekat-dekat first ah
then there's there's this  apa shopping mall  baru lah  apa nama dia they
 dorang betul-betul cater  untuk singaporeans but because I went there
 besar-besar lah the poster uh you can use Nets here Nets is a singapore thing what right so
literally every shop in that mall I think is paradigm ah I I can't remember the name you  boleh pakai Nets so it's obviously catered for singaporeans what
mm  nak kena tukar
I think out of all the people you know right like how much I love to use SIRI every like every err err everything that we want to search on google I'm always hey SIRI and dorang tak faham like dorang selalu macam give me some weird err weird like response
I macam malas nak taip okay so SIRI suppose to be the convenient option right it's suppose to be more convenient it's suppose to bring more convenience to your life tapi it's like double job ah I I I don't mind it honestly I don't mind it tapi you you yang selalu macam
for their day to day like everything is SIRI seh because I think they have like like google home or like alexa right those I think those ones are a bit more receptive a bit more macam how do I say like err they can do more commands maybe but for SIRI macam everything tak boleh
kita just tak kaya lah kita tak kaya
ya so if my phone can actually macam faham what I'm saying from time to time it would be nice lah I would I would appreciate it a lot lah
ah okay okay let's think of a scenario okay maybe raya raya kita pergi rumah dorang
okay salam hey selamat hari raya selamat hari raya
oh I makcik I I yang makcik eh wah okay
okay okay you makcik you makcik
you pakcik okay okay you pakcik you pakcik okay
okay okay kita buka eh hello selamat hari raya
baik dari rumah pak ngah punya
tak okay okay jer okay oh sejuk sangat
oh okay lah so pakcik tu akan cakap err hey SIRI make it hotter
kan yes it like that always happens like what's the point lah honestly I tak tahu lah what
I hope dorang macam it's it doesn't become like one of those err you know the movie her
like okay okay so the this guy eh okay I kind of forgot what he does or whatever but the essence of the story is that he err macam fell in love with the so macam because the became dia punya kawan like the only companion that he had or not maybe not only companion but the one that he feels paling faham like paling understanding
something like that like so dia macam
very err macam
existential crisis kind of thing macam oh no what's going to happen to me whatever whatever so ya that's kind of cool
it is kind of cool lah actually macam
it in this recording he said that tak tak dengar
I cuma dengar
no okay let's not let's be good citizens but anyway macam ah I think it's a good thing what he did only because like he made use make good use of the time you know of a bad situation he made it into a good one and
um like you macam lupa life before COVID mana concert err err indoor stadium ada
err you know what's weird like err I've been to concerts dekat big box and I feel ya
err err don't know but I think it's like the third or fourth level something like that and then dia macam um it's like a big
no but maybe maybe different concerts different but I think I've been to two concerts there and both the concerts is err like standing and I think it's weird because macam
kind of like JEM you know westgate like all the the malls there tapi macam to have a concert like the the the artist from wherever they are flying from they will be travelling
to jurong so they will feel like you know like I I guess you get the real or like you get a sense of like err a bit more macam authentic singapore but
like weird lah to have a concert there cause it's like sebelah dia is like furniture shop you know the furniture shop tempat makan I guess macam what
it's like you ya you have to buat research dulu ah like you cannot straightaway
is it in the the food court or is it like macam like tempat makan on its own
oh oh like I I probably have been to that food court and the food court that okay the the stall that I love so much dekat sana is
the naan oh my god the indian food dia punya naan is I think two dollar fifty and sedap gila and like the dia punya ah butter chicken macam tak tak ah lokek super sedap
I know macam dengar you punya mulut macam berair liur macam you know
not for more than just satu occasion ya
oh okay pasal like it's every macam not say it's everywhere it's like it's not just one specific place where all kurtas are it's like everything is everywhere ya I get it
and mahal gila like kita pula dia
oh murahnya you shouldn't gotten that one
okay kedai apa because I pernah makan dekat tekka punya market and there's a certain stall yang sedap also like it's not bad
is it dekat entrance you know there's the bus stop
I menang seh
ya so I macam very competitive
and like macam you know like like it's time I win something or more among your friends
or actually not had to win that game is like whatever opportunity I I boleh I akan menang lah but it was it was fun I love I love hanging out with your friends
mm like honestly same to me macam I'm not really surrounded with people yang
really play a lot of board games at home or my own friends they don't really do that but I feel like ever since I met your friends dorang like are really
I don't know maybe if it's in their nature yang dorang not the most err not say friendly not the most social macam
ya but not a lot like I it only I think only this year then I learn how to play monopoly betul-betul ya err before that I tak tahu sangat macam mana nak main monopoly deal also I tak tahu main
this is the thing okay the only thing I played eh a board games macam betul-betulnya board games macam meaning you are the board macam not card games or whatever first okay kita just board games was the game of life
I I think masih ada kat rumah but I have to find it
okay everyone will start at a point where okay kau nak belajar ke kau nak
ah start kerja straight it's literally like this it's literally life decisions ah that will make you ponder about what to do next tapi dia macam fast forward gila ah sebab after maybe a few turns you dah graduate lah err then for those yang macam dah start kerja after a few turns towards the ending you dah ada anak you know you dah get married you dah ada anak so it's like it's very fast tapi it's quite fun err so that's the game of life
no I've never played that also when I was young so snake and ladders was only because your friends you know macam introduced me to board games and shit oops sorry err introduced me to board games eh I wanted to ah bring that board games to
officially like official game rules I don't know how to play like to me macam snake naik atas ke turun I don't know ah ladders boleh turun ke naik atas you know like I don't know which one is which err I don't know proper dice rules also macam err you know like if you um)(ppo get the same ya exactly or snake and ladders I think cuma ada satu dice satu die so so you get six you can go another turn that kind of thing ya like I don't know I don't know so it was that was the first time also I played with my friends um but before that so there was the game of life when I was younger
dia macam aeroplane eh ya I I ingat and I think I rasa I rasa I pernah main juga but I tak pernah
like research how to main betul-betul ya
like kita lend or macam like kita will put into groups and play I don't know but pick up sticks was one of my favourites also like I love to play that game
it's the one yang you cannot move the thing right
whatever it is okay lah some people will think strategically dorang nak amek the one with the highest points some people are like just take as much as you can and accumulate all the points
so but whatever it is okay it will start with how to explain it eh all the sticks in one hand okay and only one person does this dah one hand and then dorang just lepaskan that's it
I think is I think as many I don't know lah but like only one person have to do that and then dia lepaskan kan so it's like everywhere right scattered ya so like each person just have to take one by one lah
ya which is okay tapi sometimes even the one at the top can tergoyangkan yang the other one
okay I tahu about that ball I don't know what you do with that ball like macam is it supposed to be a throwing game or what but yes I do remember that paper ball yes
for a moment I macam
in my whole life I tak pernah cakap tu dekat siapa-siapa so kenapa I cakap tu dekat you I tak tahu main chapteh no err I I think I'm pretty bad at chapteh err for people who can play what's that called yang the sepak takraw I salute like cause it's kind of similar right you pakai kaki like flick the thing up like I think sepak takraw is harder than football or soccer ya so I ya I really really salute people who can play sepak takraw
I I I think it's better if you play it and also this recording is going to be vet by other people I tak tahu kalau the rules betul ke tak completely tapi basically like ah I I really want to play with you like this game so maybe I think we should get but okay congkak gives me this memory from primary school okay so primary school ya let's go way back in primary school
kita ada this one corner
macam kampung-kampung eh like but okay
err with the steps as well like it was like err I don't know how to explain ah okay paint wall right to look like the house right and there's like a platform with the steps to make it look like you tengah naik atas the ya to the to the macam what's that call like a patio luar the kampung like outside part of the house
okay ya the serambi and then like you know okay so over there they will like not say cabinets ah like shelves of games you can play so congkak was one of them
like something similar right okay lah dah tak special
so oh that one also macam macam eraser
err I never played but there was a point where like I would have a few of the country punya flags ah
oh ya it's always like the hardest to find eh singapore err but I never had singapore punya flag
oh wow apa tu it's like a what subscription box of erasers you don't know what you're going to get but each month you get or each week you pay
um and hopefully it will happen lah but till then macam it's not my biggest priority as of this moment because I feel like you know I want to be at a macam okay there are different goals that I want to achieve in life and right now that's not like what I want to achieve at this point
mm cause I think err macam uh in any company in any business there's going to be a loss you know but I feel like if I lose now it's too much of a loss ya so I want to be a bit more comfortable first and then
no like err macam I understand this is a goal that I want in the future
but if I want to push that goal forward I cannot do it now like I don't think I can ya ya maybe macam the planning lah planning maybe boleh
but macam kalau I nak buat sekarang execute everything sekarang I don't think I can yet
or your you know like you whatever it is you can still sell or whatever or you can still find the next big thing the next idea like but it's on you lah someone can have the same product but they cannot sell as good as you for example you know so I'm not too worried I do I do understand that macam kita dah discuss the idea we really love it we we think that you know this could be something
um tutorials to her starting vlogs to then her macam err buka her own ah no no not buka ah she collab with major makeup companies
so that's like the starting right like the first step is like collabs right and then after doing the collabs and she actually collaborated dengan this satu sunglasses company
ah like she gave birth to both her babies but ocean ya it's very nice but err that's not my macam
a household name like okay like macam everyone knew fenty as like her name fenty rihanna robyn
such a global phenomenon macam and it's because kan like she had the okay business is business you get money money is whatever you know like that's the goal of any business to make money to make profits right tapi the way she did it eh because she started with the makeup and the makeup brand the way she did it was
inclusivity was diversity was macam err
macam maybe you know there are certain shades that doesn't match her or certain um products that are not the most friendliest to macam that kind of skin tone
was probably like years in the making as well it's just that starting with that as the first business macam like it really
as the main thing that I'm doing in my life macam I dah tak payah kerja dekat office I
dah macam my family is taking care of
like all those kind of worries dah tak ada and all I can focus on is my business
but it's more of a personal thing it's not macam the company success you know maybe the company success is to get returns macam to get return customers maybe that's one way of like um success but for me is a personal thing when it comes to my own business is that ah
hundred K you nak tahu tak kenapa I tanya tu sebab kat instagram I wish I wish tak lah but okay actually
it's not a scam like I I I'm very particular when it comes to like the things that we see online right but so instagram there's this account and I'm still trying to understand actually so kalau you boleh faham you boleh try to explain to me ah so there's this account that is called curated business curated businesses okay that's the handle how I found out about this was kendall eh kylie jenner posted a post of her with luxury bags saying you can win this plus seventy K
and if it comes from kylie jenner it has to be like you know legit right so okay so the steps were that you have to follow curated business and scott disick scott disick is the the ah kourtney kardashian punya
okay so you have to follow and it was like seventy plus accounts seventy five I think so you you have to follow all of those and then just comment like like err the question was who are you going to share this seventy K with so all you had to do was um answer in the comments section who and just follow the businesses which I think it's a way to increase kan like real people you see it's not bought followers it's like real people punya accounts tapi the moment the giveaway is done orang akan unfollow ah
but it's just that like kalau orang tu terlupa then maybe the account is still there
okay so lepas ni semua orang so seventy K plus like all the bags tau plus tau it's like and it's open internationally so like I wanted to see how legit it is again they have winners from different parts of the world they have from japan they have from mexico they have from
so it's like it's cool lah macam you menang you menang you tak menang you tak menang ah so I ask you that because I macam if I really menang what am I going to do like
it's one of those things where you won't know until it actually happens you know or like you can think about it but will it happen this kind of thing so macam and some the person who won was from
I don't know I think it's the states ah florida or something it's not me ah they they said the results on friday I checked tak ada notification ya but ya like so um
I I think singapore quite mahal lah like
because the bags were different sizes macam there are some like the smaller ones there are like bigger like
okay seorang wanita yang suka
oh okay bag bag beg-beg apa what's like the
and then there was a point whenever I tweeted something macam my mum works at coach gitu ah then someone indirected me and said coach is the bossini giordano of luxury brands so that's when I macam okay I got to humble down but no but basically like um I haven't heard lah ya we're not representing it's just experiences personal
okay but anyway ya so I ni tak pernah masuk macam
sebab orang-orang dekat dalam macam sombong sikit</malay>[ah and very judgemental
err I don't know man I don't know dia punya price list seh like I think satu handbag eh
I tak tahu like
empat ribu probably gets you the small zip hmm probably the small one small bag
maybe I don't know I tak tahu I tak pernah so
just macam whether or not you'll be mm
I tak ingat sangat tapi
cause okay the only reason why I betuk-betul tahu there's a difference is that remember there's a comedy that we watched the the one the err the doctor from
no no cause macam the people who listening to this probably dorang biol like you know
ya ya ya ya exactly so the the the doctor punya salutation that's given it's not medical
I understand macam it's not something kita um
like something we want ah basically not something we want for ourselves it is understandable kalau like you tak tahu the only reason I tahu is because of that comedy and I work in a business school like that it kalau I don't I don't know mm
apa kita tahu is just main game
ya kita nak main monopoly after this actually
sorry kita curse banyak seh
tapi I trust you lah don't worry about that oh
okay err in order to be my friend you don't have to laugh at everything I say it's just that macam that is a plus point lah
err kentang the way I say it kentang goreng kentang kentang kentang okay like the question shouldn't be what do I like eating it should be what do you not like eating cause like I can eat anything else except for these foods so it's like
I don't like beef unfortunately sebab to me macam a bit
in terms of food but we'll why because kalau dah nak keluar makan
ya but I've I've never said guys I don't eat beef can we not go here like I've never said that because that's very rare that a tempat will only sell that and there's nothing for me ya
ya like steak house probably still has like ya ayam err ikan semua okay err so ya I think it's still pretty okay
just that andes andes sedap gila and
ya okay so I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's called andes but kita actually dengar waiter cakap andes so
so macam usually if I go through anything that's not
so it like macam it reduces that err
that is not a good thing also jangan berhutang-hutang orang
tetapi err what I think you're asking is more like
will they be down for you like will they be there for you and macam really support you in times of need yes
macam mm there's pros and cons you know having a friend like that I feel like
cause it's easier then later bila nak pergi kedai ke apa kan itu semua kan senang sikit apa macam I had macam
sekarang macam senang takut mengandung sebelah sebelah orang senang daripada jauh jauh daripada orang semua
eh tak lah merepek tak tak tak tak no lah
eh nonsense nonsense ah no lah then if like my other wishes is macam I want to have like a lot of money so I can do my business all able to do the stuff and all ya
ah nak banyak duit banyak
no as in cause ten K some money I save up and then I go like I do my stuff I do my own business cause nak
I don't wish to be that much to have that much straight way begitu you know I don't expect much even if it's a wish I don't expect much
then if it's you if you have this three wishes apa
oh sikit setakat kalau gitu the tiga wish is
to like tak nak jadi tua
I mean a friendly vampire is not that bad eh boleh pe it's like always
jadi macam goblin lor jadi macam goblin
goblin daripada cerita korea tu goblin
got you should use that dia banyak sama macam kiss anime tapi dia ada banyak juga macam kiss anime nama dia anime flix

sekarang the
the the first project was actually video editing then I I was like really rabak ah
I have someone to depend on kalau I tak tahu then you
dah lepas intern what's your plan
kerja part time ya I think most probably I'm going to look for like a full time job so I'll be like more secured you know
something like or engineering end up you nak go to like something yang tiada kena mengena before you studied
higher NITEC cert but I rasa kalau dah dapat diploma
tak apa lah like oh tak mahu berbual pasal kerja lah stress
the first place I want to go is actually just I nak
shopping and makan and just relax but it's like the nearest at least
like you buy your groceries ke you beli makan ke or you like even if you just uh stay at hotel over there
you dapat save money
I just wear anything selesa
um it was actually my first time pergi korea but mostly I buy is like their skincare cause

bila-bila masa I watch soccer
like I I don't really minat soccer or football
I'm not really cerewet you know cerewet like about food
I I usually just eat just that the one thing that I don't like is asam pedas
if I see asam pedas I'd rather you know starve
but it's okay lah tak apa
malay food I eat it's just I tak suka asam pedas but if fast food
like no matter how many times I eat or how long I makan already I still go to McDonald's
like I'm sure I'm sure everyone favourites is McDonald tak ke

like I feel like I watch once a month sahaja no lah I'm not into
like the drama and all if I watch also I just watch it through like Netflix ke Viu or YouTube tu jer
now now I tak
tengok apa-apa cause I like actually I am busy
like morning kerja then

ah like you know like I say myself is chill but yourself is called you know cari nahas
huh you tak sabar nak pergi malaysia I can't wait to remove the mask

dia naik habis suddenly dia turun
what tak ada kena mengena car and roller coaster
who said I tak suka car I like car
people boleh bahagi masa dia orang to to be into this
so let's let's just tahan a bit
like you know there's you people say macam uh there's like there's a
or apa the rainbow comes first something like that lah I forget I lupa
a'ah lama seh tak jumpa
my work cancel ah pasal COVID

irritating kan macam kerja berat sangat gitu nak buat like you know
tak ada mood eh
duduk office right ya a'ah
but either way I don't like to work at home then your your your school pun home based juga ke apa
always all the way like that ke pasal COVID
I'm already malas because like the first
two month you know circuit breaker I really tak keluar rumah
then uh ya then after that then it was so hard to go out again macam
tak tak jadi circuit breaker circuit baker tak
siapa kisah uh nevermind lah like that time I was so bored
like I make the the you know the brown sugar pearl then the dalgona coffee semua I make
tak ada kerja ah
ya tapi tak jadi ah some some some okay some
ya some success then some is like macam
tak jadi ah then I'm try to make apam balik but it's like
not that nice like pasar malam kind
tak apa ah
oh wow but I don't like to order kat luar because like
actually I eat macam benda yang tak halal ah macam no pork no lard I just makan you know
ya lah ya lah like kalau keluar kan boleh like choose whatever I want to eat you know
apa tinggal mana ang mo kio
oh ya that one also aku ada story
eh but jurong okay what I don't know I mean at least when I go there kan macam
a whole new world for me ah like macam tak biasa at all ah but then ya I used to like cause I was thinking macam jurong kan ada
banyak ah ya so it's like whenever I go there then tak tau nak makan apa ya so
ya maybe that's why we never like meet each other because you always there but then you go town a lot kan kerja and school
tak keluar juga ya lah ya lah
uh you know mister teh tarik gitu ah
gitu lah
rajin like more rajin in the kitchen right
then my mum was like oh bila nak kahwin you know things like that
I tempted you know because recently dia orang kata uh like
majlis like only ten people or something
ya apa ni
but you attached or tak
I see some of the comments kat facebook kan dia orang kata macam
dah dah dah lima then groomsmen like lagi lima orang
that's why then I was like patut lah
ya then they were like macam bising ah like uh
uh with my majlis perkahwinan then I'm just like
tak tak faham ah
tak tahu ah the name semua macam sama gitu I don't know ya
you boleh drive tak
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like oh hi welcome to apa apa apa you know then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask what then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous ke apa lah
you don't want to tegur like that then you just like alamak dia ni lagi then
oh oh ya ya ya ya ya ya betul tak tak sombong ah nanti dia cakap sombong then you know cause usually never wear wear the mask then they'll be like
uh eh you very sombong eh sekarang like then I'm like
you penat kerja then you just like you know zone out and then you just walk home or something but then sometimes I bumped into them then I never see then dia orang kata I like macam
sekarang dah sombong eh what what what then I'm just like what you know so
now wear mask bedek-bedek oh tak perasan lah like you know like ya but I understand what you mean by rimas also I think that one is just because singapore is hot
nak snow tak nak ah that one kiamat already
actually I don't know whether I want to still work with them I like recently I got like macam change of heart
dah tua ah like macam tiring ah events
my friend dia nak jadi temperature screener kan dekat kedai tu kan
then dia orang kata mesti ada diploma then I'm like
susah sangat ke temperature screener you know like apa seh
tak makes sense ah I think dia orang macam sengaja nak
buat susah you know then they complain like you know oh nobody want to apply padahal
tapi the people like freaking toxic seh then I cannot take it then I just like say like I don't want to come back
kerja apa uh teaching
ah tak but I got um biasa ah tuition experience and like you know
I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom gitu
ya then apa lagi eh uh
ya then now also like nak classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like macam
every hour kena sanitise gitu ah like ugh
then macam malas gitu ah
ya but this one dia toxic ah the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay lah cuma the management ah like macam
ngada-ngada ah I don't know how to say
then like the first three days the management tak datang so I'm like okay ah this job like not bad ah I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like macam
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but boleh lah can manage lah you know not so
um tengok how I work lah you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then dia orang
ya she damn cari pasal ah like with me like semua benda yang I buat which I think is like
not even her problem dia macam tak okay
then I like malas already then ya then like
if I know everything why I training right like bodoh pe perempuan ni
uh then then I know what he what they she roughly mean ah I don't get like everything but I boleh faham sikit-sikit ah
aku baru then aku tak tahu apa-apa you know things like that then I'm like
or is it the next day or something like that then she like tegur me ah she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like eh kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa then kau orang nak test aku
I know how to do lah gitu so I managed to pass the test lah then she was like okay actually um I think you can
uh you don't know anything so I uh that time I'm just like malas seh nak datang balik
you want kira work from home ah I don't want seh
but then now I I see like macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay lah I guess
my friends semua macam introvert dengan homebody juga so it was quite fun lah for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other macam
you ask them to jumpa right like like
too wild too long in that's why I'm like macam
but then my parents dia orang macam nak my sis my younger sister to marry first
tak ah I think my relationship longer but my relationship uh I'm also attached to a non-muslim
ya it makes things more complicated ah I guess then my sister she macam
she attached dengan muslim guy so that's already one
macam sekarang right I was thinking like is it
marriage is just like macam
eh but then you know what so scary leh like macam
um recently kan I baca kat
facebook ah now now got a lot of free time what so more time to browse facebook gitu semua
wah then ah so if cause to me right macam kalau kita relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
need lawyer need to sign things all macam ugh malas ah
uh tak I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know rajin-rajin in the kitchen then dia orang macam
oh um izzati finally can get married gitu you know but then I'm just like
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much kalau tahu I just
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun lah but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant gitu you know
like chiongster also lah kerja banyak and things like that then my parents also not happy ah because like
supposedly twenty five kita kena dah married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off lah
mm mm betul lah then what huh
kita pun ada cakap ah like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
then she say it's like hell lah because the mother in-law macam
like have a lot of expectations of her gitu
but sometimes kecoh is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of kecoh
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she cakap dia tak nak ah she nak cari rumah sendiri juga
like you know hari raya you pergi like rumah kat jurong then mesti ada kucing punya I don't know ah I don't know how to say ya
I never say ah bukan aku cakap eh
oh pergi pasir ris then I oh pergi changi okay then pergi jurong ah I
seram seh
oh but recently my sister kena then I was like what the hell
a bit overconfident lah dia orang kata
so so it's like I'm like oi uh why you follow me like you know padahal I'm just a
sometimes dia orang will follow from a distance which I can still like macam
buat bodoh lah you know then
there was one guy who even like macam
naik kan then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
and actually because I want to lean ah because I malas
recently kan I feel like macam I want to move to the west side because
ya so it's like macam I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
life you know like sometimes the the kerja is like so far away from your rumah then it's like ugh malas ya
so ya lah ya lah macam I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't uh what
ya lah cause in ang mo kio like macam nobody ever sleeps
then sometimes like three kan ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon then dia orang ketawa like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
because he also still studying then he want to like uh like what you say lah macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu
sebab dia nak jadi teacher so now he studying the subject
because he wants to work at punya kind of school
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't kerja you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
say before that he is macam
like when he got school kan dia nak
uh but then that semester break it I think is is macam charity
that's why just like normal expenditure kan it's not like saving for a house gitu you know
ah cina lah
I was workaholic also lah then macam
whatever lah actually I was kind of those kind like oh I I independent woman I tak nak kahwin tak nak
ada children all then in the end
saje jer like you know like
try try cause nowadays got macam banyak apps gitu lah you know and websites also
so just make friends ah because I feel like macam
my age kan like orang semua dah kahwin then dia orang macam tak nak hang out so much
I suddenly meet him then suddenly like eh macam eh actually like if we get married and have a life together macam fun gitu juga eh ya so
oh you never tell me sekolah oh okay okay
the job punya name if I'm not wrong it was apa tu
it should be ah or siapa-siapa yang boleh faham ah melayu
ya but the job punya
the job punya description wah was not that not that bad uh
transcriptions oh sorry err listen to audio punya files
no I think it's like maybe macam punya type of thing uh
ya ya basically ah but I think there's also another aspect of macam
err natural language processing punya
because kan you know ada ada debate kan whether language is
err nature or nurture macam whether there is a biological foundation for language
the brain punya mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke tak whether the can learn
because my results kan belum keluar
if I apply then like a bit weird uh but I'm quite sure I will pass lah so I think tak ada hal kalau nak apply jer
special education punya teacher
because I fall into the macam the
only one exam was quite difficult uh the other three macam
gitu-gitu jer uh okay ah I did two of them quite well err
but at the same time kalau dia rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest punya score possible
oh so macam what are your strengths what are your weaknesses gitu ah
wait he got cut off oh because the break up room punya time was ending
sebarang jer siol leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the benda ni compulsory kan
belajar belajar all the way like for hours and hours straight
for the eighteenth century punya lit
it's work for me throughout the four years uh for all my lit punya courses ah plus I hate lit uh so
biar lah dia
tak menyibuk lah dia
left maksud
oh kejap pause
but the appointment pukul enam pagi
nak kena siap apa seh you just need to go over to the location pe
okay so he's not actually baru ah macam gitu
so so your shift doesn't deal with macam punya barang-barang ah
apa and oo
kirakan dia lost ah
kita orang macam chair destroyers eh
I mean even on your off days also most likely kena tidur kan
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift punya thing uh pasal dulu nasri pun bila dia tengah kerja shift
macam even on his off days his time was taken up by
tidur dulu because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
wait so so you mean different punya clients
I think especially because macam lain-lain punya organisation ada lain-lain punya processes
so macam
solid base to work from within your own organisational punya itu
like it's dependent on the client rather than the itu
what what do you mean kena macam tu eh apa
first come first serve siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu
pukul lima five in the morning
and you don't want to be the kind yang
tanya tanya tanya macam oi you want or not eh you want or not gitu
like I have a feeling like usually the one yang step up is you and not all all those other people yang itu
pasal kan ada apa budak baru nama jaden kan abeh seniors dia jaded
so jaden dengan jaded sama-sama
never mind never mind let them cringe janji janji kita punya audio dorang dapat
no no no it's like it's like bila kita orang dua orang jer berbual macam
kalau orang melayu apa ah
ada ada ada there's a there's a uh there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
macam like like ah is it
is it kayu tiga
I think it's kayu tiga
oh okay lah betul lah I mean we we're having
I mean maybe the design of dia punya blocks also plays a part lah
but at the same time tak kan you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time orang nak balik rumah
tak kan orang sia-sia jer ketuk-ketuk siol
banyak ah anime
weeaboo kalau melayu apa weeaboo
kalau indo weeaboo
part dia pun belum sampai dalam anime dia
they had they had to stop for a while pasal COVID
uh apparently january next year in japan lah tapi kat singapore belum tahu ah
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own macam
cinema punya based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of uh apa
err to do with the film ah let's say macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself abeh nanti macam
tak lawa ah dia punya tu
ya ya that's the thing macam kalau film it's like
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel punya density
like with digital all like you are constrained by dia punya
the pixels ah and the resolution that it was framed at ah macam you know lord of the rings
is because dia punya digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
takde ah but it weren't limited like if you if you film
but all the and the extra extra punya barang-barang
was err ten eighty P punya rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether apa tu
dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya effects
or whether dorang nak apa
err just use the existing punya rendering
and then upscale to four K tapi macam buruk ah macam zoom zoom in gitu ah that's the kind of effect
ah ya ya ya macam stretched gitu
tunggu ah dia
ah ya lah you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script macam mana dia punya scene develops
you know like the three quarter removed punya angle or like
macam the kubrick punya
stanley kubrick punya follow through the halls
no tak nak tak nak
tapi macam kenyang ah boleh ah Gong Cha
how to work the camera to achieve that itu
I think director director macam gitu is
dah successful dah ada banyak duit then
the ego that comes with it is itu uh
I think it can go anywhere ah doesn't necessarily have to be macam
horror or itu it can be like it can be like drama
the person and the nature of the person macam who are you gitu
macam telling you
the the thing that I like about the original punya jurassic park is
that that err that apa
it kind of moves beyond macam like what what constitutes
like how you know there was a scene of the guy yang dia dia
err apa ada T-rex
then after that dia abandoned budak-budak then after that dia terus dia lari masuk toilet then T-rex gigit kepala dia
it's like err macam
I only remember the beautiful shots of the itu
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also macam lawa gitu
it's very macam ethereal
I cannot remember but it was the director of pengabdi setan
but I I want to watch pengabdi setan ah where to watch ah
because I I took the scriptwriting punya course apa
you make the film I write the script dah settle ah
like next year because tu apa tu
like my monitor punya resolution terlalu tinggi for the for the card
so macam I need a stronger card
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm murah punya maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know rehan that time buy on sale thirty seven murah
that's why it's so macam itu
sebab I don't like it ah because all the mat reps semua macam tengok macam uh demon slayer demon slayer
boleh beli dari AliExpress pe
of the thing because it's actually dia macam
macam with real respect for people punya feelings and not just some
random rom com yang dorang macam sebarang rojak letak kat dalam ni semua abeh mix mix mix abeh
janji kelakar habis ah
but at the same time like you must also consider macam kat japan kan
yang the source material dorang punya manga ke
dia punya light novel ke visual novel ke pe
has to be actually very popular dalam its own format
or sampah habis
different ke
so sahaja jer ah dia ambil
oh dia muda eh
husband dia singaporean pe
oh abeh dia just dapat kerja kat sini ah
maybe dia punya dia tak kasi basis book tak suka ah
wait dia tinggal kat mana
as in as in in indonesia dia tinggal kat mana
boleh eh
try uh nanti
you watch the show then after that you tell me you tell me what it is next time eh kita kita cari korean punya movie
wait so so far your your korean punya tu sampai tahap apa
as in like dia punya apa tu
boleh understand adult punya language ke
macam hyperinflation
came first sebelum writing
dia punya shine through lawa tak
oh macam too good to be true gitu ya
ah ya I mean it's not lucky lah it should fit because it's all out punya key cap apa
alamak minta tolong apa
alamak tutup eh tapi today today saturday kan normally weekend sabtu ahad buka apa okay mm
doesn't matter where tapi nak kena dekat ke nak delivery ke nak apa
mm I think for me kalau recommendation I recommend just nearby kalau since you're going out already might as well pergi to err minang minang
I forgot the name ah minang house I think minang or minang house I know of a few so that one yang popular dia dekat dengan masjid sultan just in front so kalau you masuk from the
eh from the back I think boleh tapi from the side lah the side gate you just park there then
masuk maybe like lima minute jalan lima minute
then mesti nampak mm mm
selalu long queue lah every time tapi the only thing is you have to go with your parents early lah kalau tidak lunch time selalu wah the queue is like gila like oh my god like you can see
I don't know dua puluh orang dalam queue
tak boleh tak boleh buat reservation ah just queue I mean I don't see them taking reservation lah because dia punya tempat macam macam biasa macam kedai kopi tapi dia macam atas punya kedai kopi sikit ah cause boleh ada two storey so and it's like a shophouse so definitely I don't think they take reservations but
ya lor just walk in lor but I mean kalau you want just go maybe pukul sebelas
mm ya sebelas setengah sebelas setengah for lunch tapi because dinner normally err I think tutup
um ya so I think kalau nasi padang kalau nak makan fresh you makan lunch lah jangan pergi dinner dinner
susah lah kalau nasi kalau you know lauk kalau basi sakit perut seh
tapi tu apa tu err singaporean yang buka apa
ke indonesian
orh okay interesting I mean cause from what I know kalau nasi padang normally lah selalu lunch kalau dinner I don't know I mean the the other one that I know is at paragon tapi that one is in a mall lah
and be be prepared to pay like I don't know I don't know I on average lah macam empat puluh lebih lima puluh lebih because dalam paragon you know lah it's an atas mall so tambuah mas
tu also very popular because last time you know lah tourist selalu pergi and then
err I think it's at basement basement one or basement one or two lah hmm so you can expect the place to be a bit more atas lah
ya lah you know lah situ beli gucci lah lah prada lah ya lah kalau ada duit lah kalau tak ada duit then different story lah tengok-tengok jer boleh lah kan tengok tak ada tak tak ada duit apa tak minta duit eh
mm try lah I think that one is one of the popular ones but I think makan situ lagi sedap
eh lepas ni nak pergi mana
pergi shopping ke
go earlier lah nowadays because aiya you know lah sekarang because of the pandemic alamak macam macam like nak masuk mall jer nak check in check out then like ambil temperature lah abeh mall lain habis store lain
abeh every store you go you have to take your temperature my god it's like I mean after awhile I don't know for you and your parents but I like for me when I go with my mum it's like penat seh just masuk keluar masuk keluar
like non stop and then kalau tak kalau tak ambil temperature tak ambil tak masuk dekat safe entry thing tak boleh masuk
even if you want to go for like five minutes also tak boleh
I don't know whether you experience that before some shops okay and then some shops tak okay I'm like really like come on lah like give chance a bit lah like you know but I guess everyone has to take it seriously lah that is true tapi macam kelakar because at the beginning bila this started semua orang macam alamak kanchiong kanchiong spider you know macam alamak
okay how ah macam how to check in how know contact tracing lah this and that and then after that after awhile
I think right the best kalau ada duit beli online sudah
uh uh betul memang memang my mum also experience that before dia beli apa lah kelakar it's not just baju eh it's like barang-barang rumah sekali after that dia punya colour lain and then dia punya size pun lain
ada boleh lah ada like macam all those order macam order from china all that how to how to return back seh
no gambar cantik selalu gambar cantik makanan pun sama every time kalau order grab dia punya gambar alamak macam photoshopnya wah it's really like damn atas the photo
and then sekali datang like that time okay it's funny that time eh I'm sure you mesti you ada story pasal like failed grab delivery punya apa tu
punya orders my god my my time bila I mean my experience so far is like oh my god
like it's really crazy like okay example leh that time I beli ayam penyet and then you know what happen nasi tak datang boleh gitu order ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet tau tapi nasi
tak ada and then bila bila complain dengan dia orang firstly dia orang tak angkat phone abeh dah dah gitu and then nak tanya lah
mana mana nasi kan nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang order nasi lemak tak ada nasi order nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar
and then dah lapar and then after that dia orang boleh cakap oh I think the nasi dia orang either dia orang lupa atau driver makan huh tak I don't know nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa
you imagine if it's you kalau if it's your if you are in my shoes tak marah
nak nak tunggukan nasi and then takkan so the the kelakar part is the kelakar part of the story is what know
bila I call them to go and say that the nasi tak ada and then dia cakap so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say ah tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke and then
kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa tau dia cakap ma'am because right the restaurant err a lot of order ah ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait ah maybe one or two hours untuk satu nasi I'm like ah
tak payah lah in the end my mum masak nasi sendiri ah so thanks lah so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
satu jam eh eh kalau I mesti dah
dah membara you know like dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk
abeh still nak tunggu satu jam eh tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli mcdonald's sudah
ya lah masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak clean up tu nak bersihkan eh tak payah lah
ah wah mesti crowded gila ah
abeh huh cancel
eh eh jahatnya sedih
so I think also susah lah macam the restaurant nak blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end siapa yang suffer seh
dia punya gaji bukannya berapa seh kesian mm mm
tu lah I mean I selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal lah dengan motor lah dengan kereta lah and then
selalu macam you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun alamak macam susah you know macam kesian ah macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya
apa tu dia orang punya job lah like tapi tak tahu eh macam let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer lah
eh eh baiknya lah eh eh siapa seh tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu as in tip in cash or huh oh my god
mm mm betul
mm betul
mm mm betul
tu lah lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua still ada comment lah singaporeans standard lah kalau tak complain bukan singaporean apa
susah lah nak order macam like that time baru my friend order apa eh I think dia order
susah kalau I mean that time my friend pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang eh that time my friend order during bulan puasa ah during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk lah because dia orang ada macam
apa macam err open house eh bukan open house macam
err family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be lah you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is dia hantar banyak rumah so they order macam maybe like four packet like empat packet satu rumah
so altogether maybe about empat puluh packet they just put you know lah
malay family banyak kan
so dia baik hati lah because like one of the days dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the makanan basi ah dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi and then macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan
so dia punya order datang pukul empat
and then dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas and then after that makanan dia basi so satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih
ah abeh yang kelakar punya yang the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that err food stall dia boleh cakap apa tau oh err sorry ah to customer who got the food that is basi
ah ah so also kelakar lah because okay lah kalau macam restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you macam a bit of refund or what lah but because they are
correct and then nasi I mean okay nasi padang eh maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month eh plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus tau then imagine half of the nasi basi macam mana gitu
tak ada tak ada tak ada refund tak ada dia boleh cakap oh we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya lah tu lah kesian and then it's like macam
pergi mana cycling kat mana seh
boleh juga lah eh tapi esok sunday seh confirm banyak orang
oh masih
ah ah sama mountain bike ah sama tak tak tak tukar
mm I think makan apa err cinema tempat wayang kan masih tutup kan oh dah buka eh tapi dia punya gambar semua macam gambar dulu-dulu jer siapa seh nak tengok
mm mm I think sekarang that day I think what lima puluh or something like that
boleh lah sounds like a plan bro
eh tapi kat changi banyakkan dia punya tempat yang nasi lemak macam semua semua best nasi lemak so semua semua kalau tanya mana satu yang bagus dia cakap ah semua semua famous tak tahu I think I don't know like five
six five or six stalls there right that jual nasi lemak or is it is it more than that I can't remember dah lama seh tak pergi makan changi tapi as usual kalau nak tanya orang
mana best nasi lemak semua best ah depends ah yang mana depends on apa like you suka tapi more or less sama apa selalu nasi ayam ikan timun sambal dah kan apa apa yang beza dia
kan unless it's sama apa kalau nasi lemak I mean okay lah the good thing is that dia punya price there is like macam dua I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya
uh uh dia punya nasi punya banyak I always I always ingat dia punya ada dia punya stall kasih lauk banyak abeh ada nasi macam macam walao like mountain like that know makan tak habis
mm ya lah standard kalau makcik kalau kasi wah very generous then kalau senyum-senyum sikit nanti mesti dapat lebih
okay boleh mm
okay lah boleh lah hopefully tak hujan seh sekarang kalau weather you know lah macam unpredictable that day punya lah panas I think I check the temperature you know what's the temperature thirty four degrees seh thirty four degrees tapi
kalau you tengok iphone punya app kan dia punya degrees ada macam ada macam feels like ah macam macam actually
feels like is forty two eh wah forty forty two dah macam dekat dubai seh
ah ah tu lah it's like and then kelakar kan because nowadays bila panas very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time dekat dekat singapore I think kat mana entah changi ke pasir ris ke bedok the rain sampai flooding sampai banjir and then the banjir is so bad that
at the bus stop dia punya orang is standing on the seat eh
and the air naik all the way tau
macam bukan kat singapore seh
a'ah betul a'ah betul betul
ya and then I saw seh banyak orang macam video
and apa tu banyak orang video of the incident that happen then like one of them is so funny because kan at that point of time you it's like I think I don't know lah since circuit breaker or something like that
or phase one or something then the dia punya it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus leh and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers habis lah
basah kuyup seh habis ah
kesian uh uh tu lah that's why it's like really not like singapore seh
and then means weather forecast semua salah lah
tu lah like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain dia cakap actually suppose hujan sampai tuesday ah next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today punya lah panas mana tak dengue kat singapore
weird leh no but talking about dengue oh my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day pasal the dengue case and then one of my colleague boleh kena dengue seh uh uh and the kelakar part dia mat salleh
dia dia asyik I think dia asyik keluar petang ah pergi jogging ke apa entah lah tak ingat lah apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap oh I I was out sick for one week so I said lah how are you so I thought maybe um like he fever ke cause you know lah nowadays kalau sakit it's like either you kena COVID nineteen or you kena
dengue and then the funny part is dia cakap dia kena dengue
uh uh confirm and then dia dah takut because they dia ingatkan that kena masuk hospital lah so actually tak payah because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
I I I don't know how he got it I think dia cakap that maybe because dia selalu keluar petang ah dia keluar petang to go jogging around dia punya area and dia standard lah dia tinggal dia tinggal kat robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area ah then after that
err don't know how he balik and then dia macam dia pening lah abeh dia batuk-batuk lah and then dia macam
dia rasa macam something is wrong lah so dia cakap actually dia pergi doctor first time then doctor say oh maybe you're just tired because dia sekarang kan everybody work from home ah then after that dia ingatkan
okay lah maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end dia pergi to another doctor the doctor cakap dengue then dia dah panic lah
so dia macam eh macam mana ni macam mana seh so dia dia takut that dia kena hospitalize lah because kalau hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
p[a'ah tu lah and then nowadays you know lah kalau ambil is not like those days lah ah like dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi I mean ambil boleh lah one two days stay at home sekarang is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss semua tahu habis seh
is it tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak
abeh macam mana seh dia orang nak check macam I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay lah I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like err kat apa tu at the west side I think yishun or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day ada fogging ah
and then fogging you know lah the smell oh my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in yishun and woodlands they say every other day ada fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell macam nak muntah seh and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
my mum even funnier bila dia dengar pasal these dengue cases and then like because that day I read it was ten thousand so then when I was talking to my ang moh colleague the the guy then his then err he said he doesn't know lah that because they ang moh apa he from sweden ah dia tak dia tak dia tak baca local news sangat lah baca pasal COVID nineteen COVID nineteen
and the pandemic and everything that's happening in the world lah then but then he never read about the dengue then he said oh I didn't know that dengue was a very big thing so I said ya it's actually ten thousand cases sekali I read on the day itself is already more than twenty two thousand cases eh it's crazy my god
tapi macam mana seh
macam mana nak tengok kalau even if your eyesight is like perfect eyesight macam mana nak tengok
by the time they want to gigit you they just gigit
so leceh lah sekarang kalau kalau sakit then susah tau nak kena pergi doctor lah nak kena self self isolate lah then macam-macam ah like macam-macam test seh nak kena
nak kena ambil is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know lah is hard to predict right ya so kalau dah
I don't know lah just keep healthy lah ah just keep on exercising makan betul-betul jangan makan all the
he just drink water a lot everyday because dia tak ada medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary ah
macam-macam lah nowadays
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day mesti ada something you know and it's only what august oh my god
ya lah ya lah betul susah lah
ya lor that's why how seh they check everyday like that tak penat ke macam
mm mm ya lah that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see lah the weather like panas lah hujan lah then all the air bertakung like that then mana tak dengue seh ya then there's nobody like
because my house area ada banyak new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks macam seram seh like so quiet mm so I guess lah because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
more and more ya mm mm betul lah correct
ah ah betul lah kesian eh
mm mm tu lah makan maggi jer lah hari-hari they are also heroes ah mm mm
no lah work from home lah because office tak buka then how
mm mm kat raffles leh oh my god
sama ah
mm mm tu lah
correct and then kalau you know lah kalau lunch time situ not only crowded like raffles and area I mean most times you are like spending so much on your lunch like you know you know lunch you know the lunches are like what
ten to fifteen dollars on average and then and that's like every other day kalau makan luar jer dah mahal imagine like five times a day five times a week you have to do that walao like it's a lot of money you know
correct like all the small small things ah like I think you spend less lah when you're working from home and like we're staying home more often you really just spend on like the essential items like groceries and like you know just the things that you really need I mean clothes also you want to buy nak pergi shopping nak beli apa seh
electricity bill lah bill air bill api
mm mm betul
mm ya a lot of a lot of emphasis is on work life balance nowadays ah I mean you tengok ah kalau
whatever lah like macam you are
kelakar right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees eh completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal lah you know what I mean
kalau tidak susah macam mana seh macam like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
every every singaporean loves you know mm mm like that day apa tu baru national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend
tu lah
mm mm betul nak fourteen fourteen days leceh lah nak pakai mask lah pakai ni lah and then I don't know like the amount of money that you're spending is not worth it lah
virtual workout virtual makeup I think that day I baru nampak virtual makeup session then like
like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day baru I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
mm mm betul betul lah netflix eh netflix hari-hari
ya lah tapi the amount of things on netflix you can watch is
homerun even like malay shows I think what bunga tanjung or something like that that they have so it's quite interesting and it's like they have diverse range lah like malay english they even have like tamil shows and all that it's quite interesting like I mean I guess
I think dah buka lah but like I mean you have to take precaution right
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say lah just go out for awhile then balik cepat-cepat you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks seh oh my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that oh the fireworks you have to do at padang because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year oh my god so many different places kat tampines ada kat jurong I think is it
once every four years right mm mm millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the duit
mm ya ya lah betul lah
boleh nyanyi mm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you rasa like macam-macam lah you rasa marah lah you rasa sedih lah you rasa ni lah macam-macam
macam-macam perasaan tapi at the end of the day mesti positive lah you know kalau tak positive susah seh I mean hari-hari takkan I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive lah of course some days kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke just feel all your emotions and then
tak penat ke eh mm mm mm mm
betul no lah and also you complain
mm mm betul mm mm
ah ni kalau ni singaporean kalau tak complain bukan singaporean kan
mm mm betul I mean there's good and bad lah I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know macam
mm betul
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask lah right I mean ya I mean singapore nak semua orang kena pakai mask
tak payah pakai mask
so like macam suka-suka jer then I like
eh boleh ah I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory lah for all but then I guess
jaga diri baik-baik lah you know kalau pakai nak pakai up to you lah you know
semua nak jadi famous ah semua tak ada kerja nak jadi famous ah so okay lah so dia orang tak nak pakai mask then like I guess
tu lah
bukannya mahal ke the mask ada I think what less than one dollar you can get already
uh tu lah
okay so err tadi kan kita cakap pasal three wish tadi kita cakap pasal the three wishes kan for the year so you said that you already have one of the wishes fulfilled what's the other two that you think we should try to accomplish as a family or like individual
your youtube punya channel do you have a target like for the number of followers
because macam I thought like your the intention of the game right was to show highlights lah but if you don't have those kind macam those text yang dekat tepi tu say like to narrate whatever that the screen is doing because most of the people who watch the video dia orang tak on the audio what kau kalau macam the person switch off the audio and you just you playing macam tak ada some err text visuals to compliment you punya video so I thought like I don't know maybe it could be your first draft jer
oh okay I faham so that means dia punya the video that you are trying to achieve or your channel kan it's like macam highlights for that particular night punya game like what other wins and what are the near wins what are the losses lah that kind of that's that's the kind of like video channel that you trying to achieve lah
so I I I'm just thinking right is like it gives me that kind of macam those err it gives me that kind of impression macam when I watch people play game kan it's like it's as though like they are narrating something or like or what are they trying to achieve through this video macam it's just it's similar just like the makan punya channel or makan punya video it's like okay here's what I ordered for lunch today okay let's see whether it's
going to be delicious mm ya is very nice ya I like the prawn is a bit juicy you know but it's not something that your audience boleh visualise or taste or what you know so I I you is it something like that that kind of err are you targeting that kind of audience where people just watch it just for the sake of watching it but there's no there's really no purpose you just like to share that like
we were talking about a one one wish that you said that you already achieve right the five which you already got through the um your spidey spider suit right then then the one that someone was wearing is apa tu the spiderman the puffy one that's the one that your brother give
so I'm thinking if we could get a family one but I am obviously cannot wear it outside because it's haram because it's very very very ketat unless I wear it for swimming
because properly they cover all my aurat so I I mean macam if you see that is a good investment for us to like all the school shoes it's kind of different kind of combination then we can right
then ya we just take the measurement ah tapi yang the one you beli tu berapa ah
black cat apa cat woman what the shouldn't he just be a cat woman but it's leather kan cat woman punya
cat woman punya okay ah ada cat woman punya I nak ah
oh ya you dah telefon your mother to come tomorrow
no wah you tahu my colleague geraldine she encash fourteen days eh oh my god I was like
how did everyone accumulate two digit punya leave balance seh
ya no but for me is I think the work from home thing save me a bit because at least I can manage my time kalau tak already I tell you by august begitu kan I would already have exhausted all my leave already for safwan appointment the children vaccination and then you know remember saffi hospitalise
ya I guess that's the only one ah oh ya tadi kita cakap pasal what can you mentioned the IKEA punya cannot cannot fit are you sure like all the cabinets cannot fit
whether right we should just err err fix the cabinet dekat err the master bedroom side because um for this mean toilet I nak ada other some improvements in err in terms like macam there's that rail handrail so that down the road kan kita tak payah nak renovate
ya because adding the macam cabinet there kan it might like macam block orang punya as in it might block lah whoever who
wait the toilet renovations two toilet renovation ten K or just the jamban
then oh right that was not your right the one that err rumah dia is actually just opposite B P there right the resale kan actually no wonder they need to err hack the toilet because she um megan got tell me before the dia punya rumah tu macam quite rundown and then if they don't fix it kan macam is cannot as in there will be leak and everything lah
huh ya ke that means they just enter the house don't need to do anything
oh then who was the one who told me that they need to fix the piping and everything ya ke izzad punya rumah dekat mana
oh they take over they are not err apa tu getting a new house ah because I know the dia orang punya cousin wardah and umar kan nearby kan that's why they don't intend to shift ah
so bila ija bersalin
oh man tapi they they always give a one week one week
tak baik seh cakap macam tu
I think I think dia pun worried seh
eh tapi dah tahu lelaki atau perempuan
orh what tanya jer ah what the heck
I don't know actually right if I were to go through one more time ah the pregnancy ah I really want to have that element of surprise lah it's okay I'm just gonna push him up or push her out and then know the gender but it's hard because I need to prepare and I'm not someone who will tak boleh tak boleh like not prepare
it cannot that and then I know for me kan I can't although it's a good surprise right if it doesn't macam if I'm not wrong planning need or what right macam it won't impact me for example like is my kid so I know that I need to make preparation for it what cause like my kid keluar I need to macam make sure oh dia punya the bottle is blue for example and it's not in pink you know that kind so to me I mean we can buy neutral colours lah it's just that I don't know ah macam
macam ah very not that the bottles that I bought have to be blue is in green kan actually the bottle yang I belikan tu all green kan because ah safwan punya milk pun green dia punya apparel pun green ingat tak and then dia punya yang all the friends yang kita beli ni semua
colour hitam so it's like there's no gender coloured gender influence colour
ya but actually I kind of like the pink pink blue kind of combination macam those kind of paddle pop punya colour like you know very pastel kind is it pastel
yang dia rainbow tau yang paddle pop punya ice cream tu tau
actually I kind of actually I wanted the this room to be like that see like this blue kan kan it goes well with this kind of pink kan cantik kan
wah okay lah actually there are a lot of things that I want to improve for this house actually the very first thing right I want to do is actually kan I nak amend and fix the dapur punya counter top I really cannot stand the counter top lah ya macam so hard to clean it's like I think it's because of the the macam the gap
ya and then the thing is right the water the water doesn't dry out as fast as I want it to be I don't know whether is it because macam kita punya rumah is just so the window is just so closed up so that you you know you can't really like the wind tak masuk I did but the thing is when I wipe it kan there's still some a bit of moist
usually ya lah usually they will they have like some uh ventilation lah so that the tu so that the you know the surfaces would dry quickly
so that's the only thing lah I want to fix just the counter top I don't know whether is it as simple as just like knocking but do you know when you knock it out the apa tu pintu cabinet will pecah kan actually oh my god
so just now I was telling you I was talking about I was err my friend called ah from uh ya just like uh like so it was quite interesting because uh they needed a picture of a day doctor err then err the but suddenly you because the doctor is from our hospital tapi they need a doctor to be featured dia orang punya newsletter
but but the thing is the doctor submitted the picture that is not that they didn't meet their requirements of the but the printer lah so they needed us to take a picture then I was thinking like can't you just use the phone because the you know my Google Pixel ni I took I took a picture and err portrait punya macam mode kan
but when I when I send across kan it's at least three meg three four meg know that's why I don't get it macam why would you need like um a professional camera to take a photo when you can just take a photo with your phone and it is about three to four megabyte is it because like the newsletter is like dia require exactly three hundred because kita punya my mobile phone kan when I check uh is like hundred eighty
so no choice nak kena pakai lah
ya lah but we don't have so what I did to bypass it right is I shot I shot it in two apa tu two style eh two apa tu file format one is the raw one is the uh so kalau macam dia orang nak edit kan they just use the raw version apparently it works
that's what they that's what I did to bypass the macam the wall stickers I I don't know I don't know how to bypass it without having a so I just took into a in dua punya format then I send to the to the printer err not printer designer then I ask them to layout because it's a very big it's a big wall sticker you would say so you only I don't know whether you wanna if because our phone cannot take raw kan actually raw image it has to be set from a camera kan
are you planning to change your phone oh wait you change already ah I don't know whether I want to change a okay the thing is don't get me wrong I suka dengan my phone which is the model but I find it too big I just wanna pixel three I tak nak pixel but that time kan tak ada ingat tak I ordered online
it's it's really huge ah serious I just find it too huge but macam when I hold it on my palm kan I will need to stretch I punya thumb onto the other side of the screen just to type it
so I I was thinking I was torn between these two options either I ambil I ambil the ring and tampal you know the ring where you can put your finger inside and then you hold it or either I put the link card punya holder tu so I was thinking which one is more practical but of course is the link holder
the kids see that one they don't like tak sedap seh I don't like it's just damn weird oh but I like the ninja chicken burger though
love it I don't know the sauce is called nambam sauce or something like that namban tak pernah dengar seh that sauce
is never never heard before I pernah dengar macam miso err miso err teriyaki is like some people ask me whether is teriyaki I feel like is a mix of teriyaki and something salty I don't know what its chicken is nice you tak you tak try ke that time
kenapa kepala you pening tak minum air eh
you should just do eh tadi mana air I eh
oh ya anyway tadi weather was ya okay tadi the seller stop dekat mana
habis macam mana but is ready is ready ah
I'm just thinking like whether this person dia ada jangkit or what sebab tu dia tak kasi you picit the door bell no but don't even allow you to knock usually I don't mind knocking initially I don't mind knocking but door bell cannot doorbell is too loud
on the floor tak ada bench orh okay lor
that's very considerate of you all the deliveries yang I dapat all hang at the handle ah then I was like how am I suppose to open the gate without dropping it so I I pick up with my hand and then I open the gate nonsense kan that's very considerate and very thoughtful
so dua the dua is dari mana punya section
no but dia nak kena tulis apa like you accumulate like which is like blind spot okay right
tapi yang paling kelakar yang I tak faham is I punya kereta I pass sekali I punya motor I fail it one time
take so long to cakap I punya figure of eight eh take so long to finish lah figure of eight must be eight seconds
ya lambat must be more than six seconds
did I tell you some uh an accident that I witness on the on a plank orang ni dia err it was rainy um but ah it was sad lah because after dia I witness dia punya accident I think it was it will stay in my mind that I couldn't forget and then I fell on the speed you know the the you have to speed up your speed then you have to brake at the line ya correct so what happened at the plank was I was right behind this person
I tak tahu apa or kaki dia stuck or what kan dia went up the plank dia dah nak dah nak like maybe err err five metres or like maybe one or two metres away from the last one and then jatuh off and then dia punya gigi hit the another side habis chip off the two teeth chip and it was not a nice cut oh it was like a like a diagonal line
oh my god you I tengokkan dia and it was a guy yo I mean okay ah I'm I'm not saying that oh err guys should be okay girl shouldn't lah but seriously it was not even a test it was raining a practice session oh my god habis dia gini-gini dia asyik pegang dia punya gigi tau instructor ada instructor no but
but rabak he just trip like that you know even the whole gigi patah tau the dua gigi patah better kan
oh boleh eh as long as you find your because I I know he didn't pick up the thing ah
oh I see I though you tampal from the
sial oh I can't forget seh I tu dia terus kan I bailed I cakap is okay I think the plank very slippery I go the other one dia betul-betul I try the apa tu emergency break tu I think I step on the the the err back punya brake kan too hard dia punya is so weird tau the back tire just swing forward you know it's so fast you know it's just like swing macam ini seh then I drop on my left knee
tak lah tak pakai
eh ada knee guard ke ah
because you say nanti you penat lah you nak I bawa motor lah apa lah
it's just water what is not like rosak what

dah lah that's the thing is lah a meritocracy world I don't know lah I just find that sometimes it's really the thing is dekat my place ni kan I don't know why is like your capabilities tak cukup tau you punya papers is to macam is to support dia punya capabilities padahal it's like
you ask the person to go to the kitchen you don't need to ask for that lah of course lah]basic is like have you pernah masak ke tak lah kan tapi doesn't mean tak pernah masak tak boleh masak benda sedap you know what I mean ya so I always give them this kind of theory so you suruh I buat something
but to compensate me to compensate me you cakap oh err I know you do a good job tapi but sorry you not wearing uh err this err nike shoes so you cannot be promoted you know it's just like you are just trying to find a excuse basically that's what that's how I how I feel so whenever I put into perspective to this kind of people just ya ya but it's not kita tak boleh buat apa-apa this kind of things are like beyond our hands oh the
then I will be like what then next time you ask me to do something I just say I could only do until this stage ya makes sense kan then bila I cakap macam tu will be like shit don't be too don't be too like err ini lah
see ah can can I just share with you about my work like the the things that I being asked to do you tahu I kena buat about this digital plan about this um publicity booking schedule tau this publicity booking schedule is not as easy as you ask for one to six eh I kasi one to six I have ten people who can be asking for one to six
so who do I give it to so it's really based I punya like okay for example maybe person A ada event then person B dia bukan event dia punya it's just a reminder ke some patient safety reminder so I have to give priority to uh ah I have to give priority to the A person kan but then the thing is sometimes is not as straightforward as that because what if
err you have three people who want to put reminders and you tak ada event so how do you negotiate so so that's the thing ah is it the thing is I can do it but it requires err half a day I cannot do this kind of planning kan macam like as a macam sikit-sikit sini sikit-sikit sana I cannot I need to do macam I need to really focus I need to do the schedule I will do the schedule for half a day that's how I do so sekarang ni so I don't even want to start on it
that admin person coming second jan a'ah wah because they are gonna serve notice one month at least so the thing is the funny thing about this person is itulah dia I don't know eh maybe err Q one end of Q one building up ya you dengar you dengar ni
actually I like something it's very funny tau this person yang masuk ni dia contact so many people around me except me tau to ask me about the job to ask about the job tau macam like
you could you just ask me what padahal kita but then I always like no orang yang dia tanya semua melayu like is like kau boleh tanya aku apa like ya shah aku dengar ada opening I mean macam we met every year because I give out the greeting cards and the apa tu the calendar and then at some point of time you need like publicity you also contacted me apa seh dia tanya orang yang dekat yang dah left a'ah macam dah transfer this one I tak tahu whether macam a'ah dia tanya sinar habis tu dia tanya meha except me
so I don't get it I mean like why would you ask somebody who who who left and orang yang tak kerja dekat department tu I don't get it seh
then I just like macam so I am a bit err I'm a bit like macam weary tau kalau macam why why she needs to tanya orang lain besides me because to me is I welcome internal transfer because I tak payah nak guide through macam that time ya because you can just ya because ya because you can just hit the ground running eh maybe they could have a better way
like bypassing certain things you know or work around certain things because the thing is although it's like a it's not a government a government sector kan dia ada we have more red ticks than the government you know and they very very macam very very rank conscious apparently you you macam like err of course I think sometimes what I want to tell my boss is that macam sometimes bukan
orang rank conscious tau is because like you tak boleh ask err a associate to be doing err punya kerja ya it's not a right what ans it is not because it's not it's nothing about do about your rank tau it's got to do with what you are paid to do you know so I I sometime I tak faham when people say like oh err you shouldn't be err you um saying that you just because you are associate you cannot do this
I mean is usually two sides to a coin ah you can see as like oh ya uh I shouldn't be err drawing lines about the work that I am doing but you also should look it at a perspective like if I keep doing this right then I'm being short changed and nobody likes to be short changed so for you to be saying this you are being selfish because at the end of the day you just want to get work done you don't care who but this person is is severely short changed so that that's the thing lor I I find that it's very hard to juggle kat at this this place I'm working at
dia macam tak dia tak err macam kalau kat yang kerja lama I ni dia very is very obvious tau macam you macam tadi my yang call I dia cakap dengan I err kat at least dekat kerja lama kita kan err we know okay this for this job cuma but the responsibility lies with the your degree holders the responsibility lies with them tau macam if thing goes wrong kan they are supposed to check
this and um they should be responsible um take responsibility for it and then now I heard they because they always change the person person kan ah baru punya orang and this person is from punya side lah so they are still learning the ropes to run that place ah side so apparently what I heard is they open more postings more openings for err diploma holders so dulu kan exactly so kan I bilang you there's ah err in that admission kan they have um
err the comms officer err assistant comms officer dengan abassir kan the one that I kan melayu they are very so now comms officer boleh pergi can take up the comms officer job
I know lah tapi macam ya no no but the thing is the opportunity to go tapi dia tak pakai tu ah ni ah tak pakai tudung ya so I mean it still applies lah I guess
I'm just thinking whether I should buy more of this err diffuser oil no wait I like it you don't like ah that's why you say macam the cockroach keluar malam-malam kan I mean dia orang mati kan I'm just thinking whether is it is it this smell that is causing them to be opening
unless it's like the baygon but the baygon cannot be is like dah lama sia I spray but if you notice this past few nights I tak spray tau maybe they just wanna commit suicide
I don't know no but err what I heard is you run over the tray kan you got you mati
no so what I did was I use the baygon I spray I spray a tray so the moment they pass this line kan they will die really you go and read about it is like you put them ya it's like baking soda so what they did was they put the baking soda punya powder tau then semua mati
bedak just normal bedak ah not bedak apa-apa
oh macam the the talcum powder eh
dia dia curi daripada bapa dia then she give me I don't know then um err got caught lah got caught by the teacher teacher teacher cause we went to the next block only like this is the primary school the next block she saw because the staircase is like
bocor gila then um apa ah dah kena tangkap then her family lah her family kena called what kena called they came down ah they came down where you get the cigarette ah apa adik curi daripada bapanya I was like
a'ah no she say like adik curi daripada bapa then she like oh no like please no bapa kena support ah I was like oh shit this shit is gonna be a real then I like oh no no no no no I was so scared because even though it's not my family I thought the family is going to come and slap me
at first they say okay err they give me a choice lah I don't know why ah they give me a choice but to my friend they never gave a chance they straight away call I think because is not her first time ah because that one is really my first time then err terus my my cikgu datang ah she she was like she's a very nice principle lah she eh no that one is principal not teacher she came to me like okay I'm going to give you a choice is either you go home tell your parents about what you did today
err dulu I like to mix around with like eighteen year olds because dulu kan eighteen year old boleh beli kan last time I mix around with eighteen year olds people then they smoke then I was like eh I was like eh I want then my senior was like
not really stole lah he just left it out then he was drunk then I was like oh you know what if I take he's not going to know ya then err then my senior was like okay kalau kau hisap rokok kau ambil ah so sorry then um I came down lah we came down lah they give me then we smoke I was like wah hisap rokok tapi tak tarik tau then I was like err because this one is called tarik
if tak tarik is like you receive the smoke is more thicker
ya so that point of time I was like just like that lah I never like like that so they was like err and they were like um okay then they teach me lah how to tarik then I was like eh feels much better but I cough a lot lah
man apa ah err ya lah then they taught me how to smoke then we start to smoke smoke until I get to buy my own pack I tried my best twenty next year baru twenty one ya but now I still lepas lah but then ya
tak sometimes is your ya I think because of my body size that's why dia orang macam okay okay can can because I have the body of mak-mak punya orang macam last time last time but now I am like I I went back to skinny then I went back to like this now
and my thighs thighs memang susah nak hilangkan ah
takpe takpe exactly now with my father lah my father cakap eh kau ni gemuk apa lah semua tu that time I blast out at him like this is my body I'm your daughter you don't have to body shame me
no matter what exactly oh my god that is like damn offensive then everyone is like oh my god malunya then err that time I blast out at him lah like this is my body as my father you cannot just body shame me in front of others like
exactly and kau kurus pun is not in a healthy way so kau nak aku kurus apa ikut cara kau then is like oh my god I'm so frustrated then my father was like
like keep quiet ah dia macam serba salah gila then he minta maaf lah it's like bapa minta maaf ah I'm very sorry for what I said to you then sekarang dia start balik cause I want to take err license uh motor punya license so he at first ah dia memang tak kasi dia larang dia larang gila babi then I ask from my mum my mum kasi then I told my dad lah like asal mama boleh kasi bapa tak boleh kasi then he
he was like huh mama kau kasi kau permission cause my mum and dad cerai so bila nak dapat decision memang susah gila ah then err apa ah then my dad said okay fine kalau kau betul-betul nak ambil lesen kau kuruskan badan kau dulu then I was like you know what okay asalkan dia kasi me that macam only way
macam okay kau nak aku kurus fine I do anyways lah like any way that I can do like tak makan ke apa anything but last time I never eat for almost two months I was damn thin that's why I say when last time I err I was not fat
biscuits that's all ya light snacks only ya lah if that's the only way he can let me take license right you know what I'm just gonna do it not just not to eat lah I mean like just be skinny for him to macam okay fine kau dah boleh ambil lesen
why not mm look look at your friends your friends all poly right I'm still like those macam you know so I like motor since young cause I grow up with my aunty what then her anak
is a the first the first child was a guy so I look up to him as I grew up lah and then the motor ya he ya I'm the only child ya then dia ada motor he is very successful lah like alhamdulillah dia successful then dia pun dah kahwin then bini pun
anak pun dah dua macam okay lah you know what I'm just gonna be like him lah he he is a major in err I think major sergeant ah I don't know in in his army ya cause he signed on ya
that one is navy navy lagi susah malay navy lagi susah
oh okay err oh shit about the army oh my god so now I I want to be a I want to join in the army also as a female yeah I want to go to all guys there yang perempuan ni actually boleh buat semua macam gitu
I know how to self-defence like siapa-siapa nak pegang kan try me like seriously I learn a lot how to self-defence with guys lah cause dah banyak kali kita dah take advantage but then I learn how to be stronger lah belajar belajar belajar belajar pang satu kali ni this guy ah dia nak try one time shoot he run away he was like like
like legit no one talk to me anymore because he is the one yang nak ambil advantage punya he he tried to macam nak pegang-pegang tu semua then I was like bro we are just friends bro then you are touching me this way then he was like can lah can lah terus I give up like okay kau fikir perempuan ni apa lemah sangat apa I give him one punch at his face because I was
that one I don't care lah like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me ke buang uh me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done lah and dia pangkat sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant punya rank lah so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did buang so whatever he did to me he will get back lah ya
I don't know the way that is not like err being like disrespectful disrespecting lah I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad lah kirakan cause he's the one that create us what so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with allah like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like bukan macam eh lu macam muak no
that's exactly ya that is like ya allah tolong lah jangan lah buat macam gini you know like please lah please lah at least that one he knows macam because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know macam like berbual maki ya allah you know that
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those hijab people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay ah macam you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear hijab and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant blah blah blah no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like like that
same sama ya true true
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect memang betul kita semua bukan perfect pun
so is like something is even orang yang very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam oh wow kita aku rasa aku betul ah tapi orang lain tengok macam eh actually dia ni apa sia dia buat a'ah sia salah sia padahal sendiri fikir macam oh baik baik baik
tapi nanti bila dah live a long life already fikir balik macam like oh my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that lah like so sekarang for the mak and minah I feel sorry for them ah because they maybe tak dia kurang ajar
pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a minah and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a minah
I can be a minah I can be a mat I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and allah give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to macam you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes kita tak macam we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but padahal macam pada kita is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to macam sugarcoat everything macam oh wow you are doing so great eh takpe ah kau pakai hijab tak tutup err apa apa ni leher takpe lah lupa melayu sikit takpe ah kau tak tutup pun takpe eh takpe ah tak pakai tudung ah kau pakai tudung dengan sleeveless pun tak apa eh kau nak main bola pakai tudung
never heard of that but ya like semalam dah cakap ah it's like okay that kind of teguran is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like wow
eh example like macam wah farah so nice ah she everytime sugarcoat me ya but padahal farah itself is like
exactly uh like seriously I feel so malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri
eh oh my god kalau tak jadi riak pun allah tak terima sia so allah sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat so the more you share to people macam eh kau tahu tak aku solat sia eh lima waktu sia
okay then what you want me to do macam oh wow you confirm go to heaven lah what you expect exactly so is like oh my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite quran ah a lot of time macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam eh kau dah khatam belum like aku dah khatam sia
I'm like okay you can at least say like macam okay kalau if your friends like haven't khatam and you have already khatam like at least two times three times you can just ajar that person macam okay lah aku tolong kau lah aku bimbing ah apa aku akan jadi your guide lah
guidance okay so kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam K lah aku jadi cikgu engkau lah aku dah khatam banyak kali like you don't have to say that macam okay lah
like for example I haven't khatam you already khatam then I'm like I really want to khatam because I want to be closer to god I want to really understand it I want to finish it I want tears of um like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then farah came up to me like example lah macam uh do you need help like kau belum khatam kan sebab aku baru khatam so kau perlukan bantuan tak at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me I was like okay ah boleh tolong tak
macam you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like oh my god like memalukan gila lah serius serius like tuduh ke
oh my god anda tak faham tu jer boleh cakap
mmhmm ya then is like okay lah if you want to be jealous because of a good thing is is actually good ah actually macam tak bersalah is not meant to be judge
alamak aku dah baca quran dah berapa tahun tapi dia baru dua dua bulan dah habis dah khatam macam
ya exactly I was like eh bukan ke tadi kita berbual pasal motor um sports bikes or street bikes

that one obviously kalau dia miscarriage salah kita are you sure you seen me I don't think so I never see you before excuse you other people is sitting down why you don't want to target them exactly
sikit lagi sikit lagi eh maaf ada benda merah kalau dia full I think it's like err seconds no I don't oh but yours
I think kita boleh start sekarang
tak macam pelik eh buat benda macam gini
you said that you nak berbual pasal
rumah baru kan
okay so rumah baru tu I was thinking
ah initially kan saya nak buat yang
colour kelabu tu kan yang colour grey
entah eh kadang-kadang saya pasal that time saya tengok Pinterest then lepastu
ah apa tu
saya nampak dorang buat macam this deep green punya colour dia macam
royal green punya colour
ada dia macam deep very
dia macam not dark green tau dia macam
emerald green gitu
okay you see this ni kan light kan dia macam something like this
no this one this one yang hujung ni
but it's not very dark what dia macam okay okay jer
so I thought that colour untuk kita punya apa tu
kat mana hall
dalam bilik feature wall kat mana seh
but then our apa err headboard for the bed kan nanti cover feature wall you cover half already what
on top then might as well you taruk frame
entah apa-apa painting ah yang cantik-cantik ke you go and buy kat Spotlight ke
ya habis siapa nak paint
no lah tak jatuh punya lah
okay I ada this idea tau one
okay okay I won't say one room but one wall you know the hallway yang ah okay sekarang it's
right then lepastu ada macam this narrow pathway
ah that pathway kan ada one wall
ah that wall yang now is the study table punya corner yang taruk printer
because sana kan ada um
dia macam ada mini table
and then bawah dia is all drawers
remember makcik tu buat
and then I want to fill up that wall with frames like small small A four-sized ataupun A five-sized frames
so if if it's a walkway I tak nak
no dining table is still kat ni pe uh entrance
sebab apa tau the
if you put raised floor dekat depan entrance
exactly orang dari orang dari luar boleh nampak and then the people sitting at the raised floor can't really see the
so then macam
okay so kat sini is one area
is macam an area of its own
then macam you don't want to talk across like that
so might as well leave it as dining area ah because anyway it's nearer to the dapur what then once you masak-masak kat dapur then you just keluar kan then it's sebelah jer
tak payah nak bulky bulky punya dining table
ah because right now dia punya dining table bulky gila
ye lah ye lah lepastu
dia punya tingkap area is the triangle one kan yang ada bucu kan
ah can ah yang itu yang bucu nya area kita buat raised floor
so at least dorang ada seating area kat situ then you can put you can put books lah or whatever you can put your playstation kat sana if you want to play games
then you don't need to semak kan the living room
because you kalau dah main start main game cam playstation kat
but workstation if kat triangular punya bucu I don't think it work because dia banyak pakai space
and dia punya space tak ah
okay so you can easily duduk lah
almari yang in-built tu
oh ya cakap pasal swing
if we install a swing that mount daripada ceiling
over the years kan nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
cam combine weight lah
nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
dalam house seram hor
saya macam banyak imagination kalau swing gitu
nanti macam ye lah awak kerja malam
then saya sorang sorang kat rumah
which we we want to buy also what you want to buy weights I want to buy the cardio punya machine
no seh I malas nak pakai tudung jogging kat luar
tak nak ah swing macam
seram pula nanti malam-malam alone
living room saya nak gi toilet dapur asyik nampak jer benda alah tu
actually the I want to put on the wall I want to mount on the wall because dia save space and it looks neater
kita baru move in what
why do you want to alih-alih kan
why you want to alih
if you take it down then you you you jalan wire right and then you just move the mount lah you screw it to some other wall that you want
then the screw hole yang kat lama punya wall you just paste it lah you cover
ah okay faham
but let's say you want to alih you want to alih where where you want to move it
then after that is already the wooden punya punya fake wall
ah tukar mood ah
but then that means you won't have your feature wall macam rumah shah lah
because rumah shah is already permanent like that because he go and buy the big big feature wall
then jalan wire kat belakang lah berlampu lah apa semua all the lights all the lights
but if you want but if you put on top of console why you want to tampal
let's say you want to move it depan tingkap
then the lights shines at the tingkap
we don't pasang first
tu nanti boleh kita tengok macam mana kita nak ubahsuai bilik tu that living room
and then we decide if really want to because light anytime you can pasang what
ah so that one we nanti nanti dulu ah
tapi saya saya tak nak rumah tu too fancy fancy you know what I want it minimalistic and clean and like one solid colour or maybe okay or maybe one one colour and then maybe two shades that's it two shades of the same colour let's say if I choose grey light and medium grey
I don't want macam blue white orange green I don't want I don't want
you want the house to look like one karaoke punya tempat ah
but it's but it's macam pening macam I don't want to come home to that kind of house
yes yes betul tapi we can do that tapi we play with shades we don't play with colour you tahu okay I want the house to look very hotel hotel ish macam atas atas hotel so you see atas atas hotel they use very minimalistic colour
okay and they play with shades and dorang punya furniture is
either if you want to choose wood then it's all macam classic wood if you want to choose metal they won't choose the heavy heavy kind of metal they choose macam ah simple ah structure metal
so it looks very macam nice and clean and comfortable tau and very fresh you don't get sick and tired of it because you're going to stay there for years
and then we can make it gradient that means atas light colour like the same green light colour light green lepastu pelan pelan medium lepastu pelan pelan dark green
if you want to buat macam a bit fancy
ah tapi gradient ada leceh sikit nak buat ah
that one tak salah you have to use sponge then macam
ah so leceh ah
so macam compared to your time spend
paint the entire house you nak paint gradient macam gitu so about the same tapi dapat paint satu bilik jer
and then you have to buy tiga cat
because you nak gradient kan you kena beli tiga tiga shades of cat ah
solid grey let's say grey ah solid one colour one shade then you just buy one big tub of cat
let's say ah let's say you tak nak buat gradient
tahu lah I know
I'm just comparing the ni
berapa litre ah paling besar
lima litre ada lapan litre
yang bangladesh pakai kan
one big tub yang I pernah beli
oh ya cakap pasal brand
ah tadi I nampak satu advertisement and then uh apa tu
I don't know what technology dorang pakai
tak serious serious macam okay macam for example Nippon Paint cakap dia punya paint is odour-free
odourless and also ah kalau apa-apa conteng conteng you can wipe it off
tak I don't know but ya
I know tapi that's how they advertise ah so
they said that the paint purifies the paint purifies the air in your house then macam wah cool lah
tapi I rasa Nippon Paint should be okay lah enough lah Nippon Paint pun everyone use also okay lah
then the the one yang boleh lap ah kalau
err see if kita nak oil paint ataupun the
kan dua
kan ada dua dua type ya
got two types of paint satu is ah
cat minyak lagi satu is cat apa entah cat kapur ah cat kapur
tapi berkilat seh nanti
the finish is berkilat
is this one this one is kapur
ah oil-based is berkilat is like how ah
it's like okay sometimes you know void deck dia punya pillars tengah tengah dia macam ada pattern pattern then it's berkilat
kalau terkena baju ke terkena apa you buang
you buang sudah tu baju
bukan susah nak hilang tak boleh hilang pun jangan harap mm
ah tu ah
then awak masih nak yang
painting painting ayat tu
tak ah
I'm not saying I'm not saying that we gantung atas ah headboard kat katil
kat ni lah apa tu living room ke kat dining room area ke
if you want ayat-ayat then okay lah put lah but frame
no no you go you go to arab street got this one uh kedai dia punya ayat cara dia buat is so modern tau
cantik gila serious serious cantik gila
no but dia punya dorang macam buat three D printing punya tau of the of the tulisan
it's not old school rumah pakcik kind serious
it's not rumah rumah pakcik makcik punya
paste on wall looks like sekolah madrasah seh
you paste on the wall then macam dia macam mengotorkan
okay unless you can show me the kind of paste dekat wall that I am going to like
ya lah that's why I tell you I don't know which one I like because to me tak lawa
because you want to paste it besar besar dekat living room that one macam
apa uh you find me stickers ayat yang pada you cantik
no lah ayat from al-quran ah
ah kalau words of wisdom might as well I take the A B C english one atau malay one
so you find me a ayat
yang paste on yang pada you cantik yang you berkenan
you you pilih
bila masuk rumah kan ada satu tembok
oh tu tak boleh buat apa-apa eh tembok tu
tapi tu nanti nanti ah
sekarang jer store dia dah kecil
the the pakcik kecil kan store what actually the store is big what
mm the the dining table bulky seh like bulky gila punya kes makcik-makcik punya style
I don't want to put it inside a room ah then macam one whole pile kat tepi tu
kita nanti nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu because tu pun renovation seh
a'ah so still akan berabuk juga ah
it's just a fake wall and then a few macam ah apa tu
ah rak-rak
mmhmm a few rak-rak then okay already ah
and pintu okay lah oh ya ah I just realised rumah makcik tu tak ada bomb shelter
and then the our new house mana ada first floor
dia start from second floor what
mm boleh jer
but I think better if orang solat dekat inside the second bedroom ah because if they solat dekat the first bedroom then let's say we have our laptops
kita ada our documents
and then some more if I then some more if I bring in yang tu ah apa tu
exercise nya machine
ah there more comfortable I think more comfortable ask them to solat dekat the second bedroom because we are going to put in this kind of carpet remember
bilik amni looks kecil sebab katil dia besar
you got see before or not single bed then bawah dia boleh pull out
dengar lah dengar
awak punya idea of walk-in
kita ada this macam very short pathway kan actually short pathway tu tak ada
pasal makcik tu dia naik kan wadrobe tu nampak macam short pathway actually it's just a huge square room that's all
macam this dua pintu so you tambah lagi satu pintu ah
and then tempat saya bersiap my
because my tempat siap is tengah tengah what so if I getting ready in the middle abeh you want to walk where got space
because your baju there what
actually kan saya tak suka bersiap duduk tau
I like to stand and siap
I thought it's with a chair and then macam
ah faham
just to taruk my barang barang makeup right
actually I don't want cermin
I don't like that kind of cermin I like this kind of cermin yang you can go up close
no I don't want to sit down I won't ever sit down when I'm tengah bersolek
mm laci lah laci kecil
can ah then the laci I can put my tudung and then kat atas tu macam I buy the transparent plastic rak-rak then put lipstick lah ke apa semua
most most probably berselerak
dia tak selerak bila apa tau macam the first few days that I kemas
nanti dah after the first week terus dah macam berterabur macam ribut taufan kat situ
orh side of the bed ya you sebelah tingkap ah
mm mm side side siapa panggil side side bed
mm tutup belum
because I was thinking if ada enough space eh if
couch kat kat kaki katil
you know okay when you go hotel hotel kadang-kadang dorang ada small couch kat depan katil
that's where you sit down drink kopi or you want chit-chat but you don't want to be on the bed you want to sit down
kat wall lah
gantung kat ceiling a bit ugly you know
tak nak ah nanti jatuh kena kepala
orh rak eh
one simple rak
then after that kita taruk projector kat situ ah
ah then can taruk frames also
then macam it brightens up the room
it does dia macam you have so many memories then you can frame it up
cantik what
because it's very personalised so macam okay for example you go travelling and then you beli painting or something and then you come back to singapore then you buy a frame then you nicely frame so macam it means something to you
maybe orang luar yang datang visiting tak tahu lah but you know what
because you are the owner of the house so you macam okay aku tahu aku beli painting ni dari mana and then uh okay this picture was me and you from where we go
because okay kebanyakkan orang kumpul this benda-benda sentimental lepastu they chuck it one side or they put it in the box they put it in the album then they never look at it
dia macam not very useful lah
eh don't want ah ugly ah tampal tampal tampal gitu
dah macam bilik budak
dah macam apa teenagers teenagers punya bilik
wow I'll be your age sekarang
tapi you dah empat puluh
imagine boleh imagine tak
awak dah empat puluh you'll be celebrating your four zero
hello and then bila you celebrate your four zero birthday birthday I belum sampai I masih tiga puluh tiga
as long as I dapat feature wall yang ada frame

that's why he always have like macam err playful fights with thor I think new zealanders and australians have
the other side will be like uh oh no I want this one ah eh you cannot I plan already mah so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think eh want to get married it's not going to be uh sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later lah nanti dulu berbual so sekarang kita go dulu then kalau later part then we can plan lepas tu buat plan K uh getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house mah
so that's for me it's very simple I don't like macam you know lah to me a rocket go to the moon how to plan that thing no need no need no need no no no no I'm not I'm not very detail so as long as happy to see

in okay so I was not like macam pendiam or what something like that so
I talk to him macam
macam dah kenal lama ah ya correct that guy is is is is cool
that guy is cool very very cheerful funny guy ya better than I think that's better than our last time yang yang supposed to be there right ya

halal that is what I want dia tak ada macam eh
kasut kasut ketat tak tak ada tak ada tak ada I don't I don't I don't have think of that cause that time for
tak payah fikir sangat ya
the best part dia punya hari tak hujan tu jer for me it's the weather ah for me for it uh dia punya for me is the weather I cuaca dia yes correct
macam dia tak susah nak dapat tu weather that time out of what january eh month of january right dia dia macam tak nak kata panas tak boleh tau pasal I'm very stable outdoor tau dia kat luar
uh okay tempat dia okay just under void deck juga kan uh kita ambil kat void deck kita book void deck so kita plan nak booking void deck malaysia dia tak ada ada ada orang book kan they're taking up other events something like that it's very dia punya port dah okay tau so one thing's uh kita dah book then apa lagi
about the ada ada water utilities right you have to go something like that and everything uh under under that lah so make sure yang siapa yang nak kahwin uh kat you know void deck ke apa kan make sure you do your planning well I'm talking about the place ah ya
kan oh really kenapa eh
kenapa eh
for how many pack berapa orang dia eh okay
oh macam the brides woman jadi batman eh
mm lima puluh eh oh tak I think dua
three tiga tu tiga oh tiga eh uh first mm
slow down the process macam macam mana
maybe along the way they boleh buat photoshoot kan dalam kereta ke apa something like that tak eh
selit sikit lah tak ada selit
oh why kenapa
actually yang pasal your makcik tu dia memang cari pasal lah ya correct why why kenapa dia buat kenapa dia nak cakap macam tu kat depan mak you kan habis what your mum apa ada dua anak jer patut kena cakap balik
oh apa asal ha a bit
okay wedding eh kena uh nak uh apa uh dia dengan kompang tu
kan that time wow that time I macam ada crusader datang tapi tu semua dah plan lah so I cannot use my proceed kompang macam macam lain-lain team pula kalau tak I smile I tak ada uh plan but it goes well
sometimes it doesn't plan well it doesn't plan before but it goes well so it's like it's like macam cool lah eh tak tak
tak cakap pun ni semua jadi sendiri eh I was like happy ah my brother was there uh my adik was there with me dia dia yang plan macam mana dia punya line up so I was uh wow that's my first time tau I tak macam prepare all this eh asal my brother know ah ah that time ya brothers are quite okay lah my best man there that time
okay so uh kompang the the luckiest I mean the best part is the kompang weather and I also uh when I came to the pelamin then I saw you there sitting
then uh that's where I meet my wife and mak andam dia cover muka dia everything like that something like that tapi ada ada hadang eh
quite fun lah but that time tak ada macam rabak punya pakai apa uh padlock ke apa nak pecahkan kunci tak ada ah but just that dia very straightforward yes
and dapat tahu siapa more yang I dah kenal kenal lah yang tak kenal tu uh kat sana baru kenal tahu macam eh quite cool juga eh I mean of course the yang paling bising pun ada
of course they are part I think I think I think your family side is the loudest and have had have more uh fun there ah quite lucky you know actually it's throughout is the families getting to know each other I mean mak dia also apa welcoming me as a new guy in the family ya
tapi kita tak boleh buat like second round dua round tiga round tak boleh the best part
talking about the ballroom let's say ah you want to go to the what orange ballroom kita tak boleh makan ke
dah jalan dah kahwin if can rewind something like that ya
okay I first thing is sad one thing is happy okay the sad part the the wedding is over and it turn actually it turn out well lah okay and dia tak ada macam problem macam power trip ke apa tak ada it just went well so the event
dah habis kan so kita dah
dah apa dah stand down everything then
not say happy but I'm very like macam uh conscious ah what where to step everything it's not like macam wah this another episode it must be a difficulty at anywhere and at any corner will come
so what I'm I'm telling myself okay so kita then I think banyak tengok movie ah or drama orang-orang kahwin semua macam ni everything macam mana how dia dia dia plan dia rely on everything so nak recalled that back dia then kena ikut cerita apa dah jadi movie or drama dia jadi you know but I want to be my own drama
I want to be my own so I cannot tell them eh apa nak buat next ah siapa nak tanya my father or my mother or wherever yang dah pernah kahwin eh apa nak buat next ah it's like kental ah so I'm a man now I don't care so now you got own you got own way so you have it's a fun life ah
whether you what you want it to be so you nak macam mana you just create yourself until now I'm still creating so as a husband I as a husband
I'm talking for myself right uh I want to be very thrill I mean not really straight ah kadang-kadang corner a bit so you know ah you know the road well dia tak ada macam uh always straight jer ada ya lah kadang-kadang kita straight pun
boring apa straight road mesti ada corner left a bit sharp turn all these ah play along lah so how you handle okay first thing
uh that is me I cannot handle my wife if you if you can't handle me what I mean myself so this what I'm trying to say that kita if you handle myself unless you can handle anyone else so it's like that
so dah kahwin then uh ya then I rest at home
okay then don't play play anymore tak boleh macam berfoya-foya something like macam uh go anyhow and then I ask permission for my wife pasal kita dah kahwin sekarang kita tak boleh macam hanky-panky dulu bujang lain tak apa
we lepak bawah bawah block apa semua mak mak tak kisah so mak abah semua tak ali bila nak balik uh kau layan phone jer sekarang kalau wife lain tau dia tanya on the spot nak kena respond
dua missed call game
kiranya macam you're asking for trouble lah I know something will break or what itu eh wife punya side but dulu tak ah so this what is a discipline ah so you have to be more not say matured more discipline and care your wife be accompany with her so that everything goes well actually when I think ah
the more I care about my wife eh the more things I get you know like macam you there's something you return well lah something you don't know what is that but something you return you return well just nicely macam tak cakap dia dah fikir dulu tau ah something like that something like that if you if you think that way ah for me lah now right now that's one thing I like about her
if you give in she will also give back so fair lah ah for me it's fair if you now I don't have any like lepak dengan kawan tau dia tak macam call turun lepak lima lima empat pagi unless work lah unless work tu pun nasib dia punya
so ada lah sikit
uh not dia tak sama tapi serupa lah okay so pasal uh travelling eh okay start from travelling okay I as in start from our honeymoon lah the that is the starting of we how we can be linked
so there's no other dia tak ada pergi tempat lain tau macam long distance that time nak go mana ah pergi mana cambodia eh huh that time was the last time so I don't know that passport dah habis pasal I not a travelling guy
so bila part nak pergi honeymoon tu I using that passport lah yang lama tu then sampai airport
that time I thought my wife eh then kita baru kahwin kan so I thought she will get angry and shocked the whole airport can hear her voice but she relax already
dia tak marah dia just cakap aja alamak it's just I know that she's very disappointed you know
tapi dia tak expose dia punya marah tu kat airport so we plan that was macam I literally divert tau pergi malaysia
and then at malaysia passport I my passport lepas so dia kata can pass through ah my wife pergi book every yang mana yang nak pergi so that part eh she really a hardcore dia boleh book
so kita pergi mana dulu ah cameron highland first baru drop to cameron highland and port dickson so meaning we go three places lah eh under under malaysia state
I quite weird we having fun there lah it took part it's not it's not about malaysia you know it's the how we make that happen until now that's the best somehow eh kita nak pergi ah somewhere like macam uh korea ke itu kita plan apa kita nak plan plan plan sampai pergi tapi ini tak tau dia nak pergi bandung dulu nak pergi bandung then airport uh then passport dia habis uh mati then lepas tu kita dapat tahu kita pergi tempat lain and that was not planned
mm so kita ramp
that time so I have to drive lah so then I think my wife my wife should realise lah until now eh I'm a good driver not punishment it's just that dia tahu tau eh my husband can you know something not something fall
someone can can bring up back macam I tak cakap eh awak I cannot drive lah malam ni
no no no no I will fork out I will fork out something you've resolved eh macam
masuk mati ke I've tried to make something better lah so that's why my driving skill come in about that time dia dah I dah drive dah berapa kali ah eh
so I got you're saying that I I I I got uh someone that yang macam
travels dengan parents tak ada boyfriend ya you see eh you can hear that or not tak ada boyfriend that will make I'm the guy okay so
so something lesson learned lah sometime kalau kita pergi bandung pun it's a one way trip dia tak pergi mana-mana tempat pun whereas kalau kat malaysia ni kita pergi macam
a few places lah banyak oh ada juga eh oh
by okay by the way kan uh insyaallah kalau abang you ada duduk sana all right
dia punya menyesal tu takde lah
pasal I I choose this what
so how you can say regret no no no no not not really lah if something like macam benda yang eh kalau tahu buat ni takde takde it just went well if I plan if I say that now
if I know I being I do that now macam sekarang kan baru nak menyesal then we're going backward
so tu yang best lah macam
marriage sekarang ni ke apa oh okay
of course kan masa tu berselerak lah
I I scared I takut bila kalau my wife dia
uh suruh buat ni suruh buat tu uh tak boleh tidur rumah I tak tengok mak I something like that lah kena very like macam doesn't goes well lah once ada ah I don't like kadang-kadang kan ada orang kahwin dia straightaway eh
kat dia punya in-law jer
I don't know mungkin dia takde can nak tengok adik sendiri for me I I don't have that my wife give me freedom to go play especially
see my wife jalan-jalan makan dengan dia orang semua ya my wife is very fair very fair so we have this uh fairness lah ha so vice versa if for me kalau apa yang dia buat tu tak salah kan dalam segi undang-undang and dengan undang-undang agama then why not just try lah so try something new cause dia try something new ni kadang-kadang dia tak boleh macam
macam lama punya style jer so kita nak kena understand kita dah apa dah zaman ni sekarang kan zaman sekarang ni kita
a lot of things all or way we can uh do business ke apa ke so you have to try it out
bersyukur sekarang ni dah dia punya takde macam apa selisih faham lah
try to be more okay dia I think ah okay my wife dia nak ambil lesen tau okay I know this lesson we will take one or two years maybe or months only but
kalau dia drive tu I think she can bring me anywhere lah might be it's her turn after five years I bring eh another five years is her turn lah
dia punya turn so hopefully kalau dia dapat drive kan untuk suami suami dia ni yang very cute ni also cute you know I'm very cute also and of course ah ya so hopefully that's my request mah and drive me anywhere
I like I like her cooking until now no failure especially my recipes I just left my recipes recently there's I just finish ah so she cook for me every night shift so that's the best part day shift pun sama yes
I like her cooking actually uh she can cook well better than me ah that part I cannot take ah they cannot part they cannot challenge thank you sayang
