okay so (err) <malay>tadi</malay> [kan] <malay>kita cakap pasal</malay> three wish <malay>tadi kita cakap pasal</malay> the three wishes [kan] for the year so you said that you already have one of the wishes fulfilled what's the other two that you think we should try to accomplish as a family or like individual
I guess that's a need [lah] not a wish
your youtube <malay>punya</malay> channel do you have a target like for the number of followers
but the thing is when I watch your when I watched that video that you uploaded [kan] it's like a it's a live stream but the thing is sometimes all I want to know is if I'm not playing that game I wouldn't know like what you are trying to do [kan]
because <malay>macam</malay> I thought like your the intention of the game right was to show highlights [lah] but if you don't have those kind <malay>macam</malay> those text <malay>yang dekat tepi tu</malay> say like to narrate whatever that the screen is doing because most of the people who watch the video <malay>dia orang tak</malay> on the audio [what] <malay>kau kalau macam</malay> the person switch off the audio and you just you playing <malay>macam tak ada</malay> some (err) text visuals to compliment you <malay>punya</malay> video so I thought like I don't know maybe it could be your first draft [jer]
[oh] okay I <malay>faham</malay> so that means <malay>dia punya</malay> the video that you are trying to achieve or your channel [kan] it's like <malay>macam</malay> highlights for that particular night <malay>punya</malay> game like what other wins and what are the near wins what are the losses [lah] that kind of that's that's the kind of like video channel that you trying to achieve [lah]
because right how I can relate is like you know those there's this kind of channel or video and (err) where you watch people eat
so I I I'm just thinking right is like it gives me that kind of <malay>macam</malay> those (err) it gives me that kind of impression <malay>macam</malay> when I watch people play game [kan] it's like it's as though like they are narrating something or like or what are they trying to achieve through this video <malay>macam</malay> it's just it's similar just like the <malay>makan punya</malay> channel or <malay>makan punya</malay> video it's like okay here's what I ordered for lunch today okay let's see whether it's
going to be delicious (mm) ya is very nice ya I like the prawn is a bit juicy you know but it's not something that your audience <malay>boleh</malay> visualise or taste or what you know so I I you is it something like that that kind of (err) are you targeting that kind of audience where people just watch it just for the sake of watching it but there's no there's really no purpose you just like to share that like
because I think I watch the live stream not the edited [one]
just you just now you say about the spiders suit right I was thinking
I don't know just now (err)
we were talking about a one one wish that you said that you already achieve right the five which you already got through the (um) your #spidey# spider suit right then then the one that someone was wearing is <malay>apa tu</malay> the spiderman the puffy one that's the one that your brother give
so I'm thinking if we could get a family one but I am obviously cannot wear it outside because it's <malay>haram</malay> because it's very very very <malay>ketat</malay> unless I wear it for swimming
because properly they cover all my <malay>aurat</malay> so I I mean <malay>macam</malay> if you see that is a good investment for us to like all the school shoes it's kind of different kind of combination then we can right
then ya we just take the measurement [ah] <malay>tapi yang</malay> the one you <malay>beli tu berapa</malay> [ah]
for your suit [jer]
include ship
how long you need to wait for
I don't know whether you want to get for the kids cause they will grow very fast
he can wear the puffy [one] [ah]
how about the brother
what about the mum mother what we have a tripod for what
K [lah] faster [lah] you order for me and then you order for #safi# also [lah]
I want to wear the gwen okay that's the only character that I can wear right
spiderman series [lah] [kan]
black cat <malay>apa</malay> cat woman what the shouldn't he just be a cat woman but it's leather [kan] cat woman <malay>punya</malay>
cat woman <malay>punya</malay> okay [ah] <malay>ada</malay> cat woman <malay>punya</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> [ah]
then I just pass it off as spider cat [ah]
the one that you say [oh] black cat right spider cat is the we just created a new character
just created a new character no I think he followed me ya he followed the style of conversation no but you ate cheese fries already yesterday [oh] ya I'm supposed to cook the soup first
ya for dinner then at least tomorrow you can eat it for lunch [lah]
[oh] ya you <malay>dah telefon</malay> your mother to come tomorrow
the thing is I don't know whether I [ah] actually I want to take half day I got
no I wait the following week is not christmas right
[ah] I will take next week actually
because I got one more half day I never take wait let me think
[oh] gosh I don't know because next tuesday I already on leave [kan] maybe I just take this friday [lor] next tuesday is for its for appointment [what]
no !wah! you <malay>tahu</malay> my colleague geraldine she encash fourteen days [eh] [oh] my god I was like
!wah! I don't get it [seh] how did you even accumulate fourteen days [eh] [oh] ya because she she doesn't need to take leave like me right
how did everyone accumulate two digit <malay>punya</malay> leave balance [seh]
!wow! what a plan
I wish I could say that
ya that's the thing because you your contract already said you need to clear you need to give it two months notice that's why you you have that mind mindset that you need to save them
[oh]
ya no but for me is I think the work from home thing save me a bit because at least I can manage my time <malay>kalau tak</malay> already I tell you by august <malay>begitu</malay> [kan] I would already have exhausted all my leave already for #safwan# appointment the children vaccination and then you know remember #saffi# hospitalise
during his first year birthday [eh] wait but that is last year but then how come this year my leave exhausted I think it's because the the sick or when they are sick I keep taking leave at the start of the year
ya I guess that's the only one [ah] [oh] ya <malay>tadi kita cakap pasal</malay> what can you mentioned the IKEA <malay>punya</malay> cannot cannot fit are you sure like all the cabinets cannot fit
then can we buy like two so one is on the left one is on the right
so the alternative is either we change the sink or we build a
serious I thought he called somebody
father in law
were we even there I was not there
what a shitty experience
was the <EX1>bangla< paid
!aiyo! I'm just thinking
whether right we should just (err) (err) fix the cabinet <malay>dekat</malay> (err) the master bedroom side because (um) for this mean toilet I <malay>nak ada</malay> other some improvements in (err) in terms like <malay>macam</malay> there's that rail handrail so that down the road [kan] <malay>kita tak payah nak</malay> renovate
ya because adding the <malay>macam</malay> cabinet there [kan] it might like <malay>macam</malay> block <malay>orang punya</malay> as in it might block [lah] whoever who
okay [lah] no no I'm not even thinking of renovating the toilet
wait the toilet renovations two toilet renovation ten K or just the <malay>jamban</malay>
then the is the end product nice
then [oh] right that was not your right the one that (err) <malay>rumah dia</malay> is actually just opposite B P there right the resale [kan] actually no wonder they need to (err) hack the toilet because she (um) megan got tell me before the <malay>dia punya rumah tu macam</malay> quite rundown and then if they don't fix it [kan] <malay>macam</malay> is cannot as in there will be leak and everything [lah]
!huh! <malay>ya ke</malay> that means they just enter the house don't need to do anything
[oh] then who was the one who told me that they need to fix the piping and everything <malay>ya ke</malay> #izzad# <malay>punya rumah dekat mana</malay>
no I mean like #dan# house
[oh] they take over they are not (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> getting a new house [ah] because I know the <malay>dia orang punya</malay> cousin #wardah# and #umar# [kan] nearby [kan] that's why they don't intend to shift [ah]
so <malay>bila</malay> #ija# <malay>bersalin</malay>
[oh] man <malay>tapi</malay> they they always give a one week one week
<malay>tak baik</malay> [seh] <malay>cakap macam tu</malay>
I think I think <malay>dia pun</malay> worried [seh]
[eh] <malay>tapi dah tahu lelaki atau perempuan</malay>
[orh] what <malay>tanya</malay> [jer] [ah] what the heck
you can just ask [what]
like that
I don't know actually right if I were to go through one more time [ah] the pregnancy [ah] I really want to have that element of surprise [lah] it's okay I'm just gonna push him up or push her out and then know the gender but it's hard because I need to prepare and I'm not someone who will <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay> like not prepare
!huh!
no I mean especially if it's if no surprise to see talking about surprise that's the thing sometimes right it works (err) in your favour sometimes
it cannot that and then I know for me [kan] I can't although it's a good surprise right if it doesn't <malay>macam</malay> if I'm not wrong planning need or what right <malay>macam</malay> it won't impact me for example like is my kid so I know that I need to make preparation for it [what] cause like my kid <malay>keluar</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> make sure [oh] <malay>dia punya</malay> the bottle is blue for example and it's not in pink you know that kind so to me I mean we can buy neutral colours [lah] it's just that I don't know [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] very not that the bottles that I bought have to be blue is in green [kan] actually the bottle <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>belikan tu</malay> all green [kan] because [ah] #safwan# <malay>punya</malay> milk <malay>pun</malay> green <malay>dia punya</malay> apparel <malay>pun</malay> green <malay>ingat tak</malay> and then <malay>dia punya yang</malay> all the friends <malay>yang kita beli ni semua</malay>
colour <malay>hitam</malay> so it's like there's no gender coloured gender influence colour
ya but actually I kind of like the pink pink blue kind of combination <malay>macam</malay> those kind of paddle pop <malay>punya</malay> colour like you know very pastel kind is it pastel
<malay>yang dia</malay> rainbow [tau] <malay>yang</malay> paddle pop <malay>punya</malay> ice cream <malay>tu</malay> [tau]
actually I kind of actually I wanted the this room to be like that see like this blue [kan] [kan] it goes well with this kind of pink [kan] <malay>cantik</malay> [kan]
not hot pink [lah] like the like the lighter [one] like a bit more pale
the app no [lah] that [one] champagne gold [lah] ya ya ya correct correct correct [ah] like that
!wah! okay [lah] actually there are a lot of things that I want to improve for this house actually the very first thing right I want to do is actually [kan] I <malay>nak</malay> amend and fix the <malay>dapur punya</malay> counter top I really cannot stand the counter top [lah] ya <malay>macam</malay> so hard to clean it's like I think it's because of the the <malay>macam</malay> the gap
ya and then the thing is right the water the water doesn't dry out as fast as I want it to be I don't know whether is it because <malay>macam kita punya rumah</malay> is just so the window is just so closed up so that you you know you can't really like the wind <malay>tak masuk</malay> I did but the thing is when I wipe it [kan] there's still some a bit of moist
usually ya [lah] usually they will they have like some (uh) ventilation [lah] so that the <malay>tu</malay> so that the you know the surfaces would dry quickly
so that's the only thing [lah] I want to fix just the counter top I don't know whether is it as simple as just like knocking but do you know when you knock it out the <malay>apa tu pintu</malay> cabinet will <malay>pecah</malay> [kan] actually [oh] my god
ya that's the only cause the master bedroom you know I don't think I want to change anything maybe maybe just the part [ah] change to a bigger no the thing is right no no no let me just explain I want to use
projector you know that [one] no you know they have this technology where you bring like the kind of like tissue box style and then you can project the thing when you have it's not a torchlight it's a projector
like the the torchlight for the story book [eh]
gosh
so just now I was telling you I was talking about I was (err) my friend called [ah] from (uh) ya just like (uh) like so it was quite interesting because (uh) they needed a picture of a day doctor (err) then (err) the but suddenly you because the doctor is from our hospital <malay>tapi</malay> they need a doctor to be featured <malay>dia orang punya</malay> newsletter
but but the thing is the doctor submitted the picture that is not that they didn't meet their requirements of the but the printer [lah] so they needed us to take a picture then I was thinking like can't you just use the phone because the you know my Google Pixel <malay>ni</malay> I took I took a picture and (err) portrait <malay>punya macam</malay> mode [kan]
but when I when I send across [kan] it's at least three meg three four meg know that's why I don't get it <malay>macam</malay> why would you need like (um) a professional camera to take a photo when you can just take a photo with your phone and it is about three to four megabyte is it because like the newsletter is like <malay>dia</malay> require exactly three hundred because <malay>kita punya</malay> my mobile phone [kan] when I check (uh) is like hundred eighty
h
so no choice <malay>nak kena pakai</malay> [lah]
no but that's the highest I could go I couldn't and then what I need [kan]
no the the photo they want it to be the resolution when you port it to photoshop [kan] is in three hundred but my the the camera that the G seven X camera at my office the highest you can go is hundred and fifty or hundred and eighty the point and shoot
ya [lah] but we don't have so what I did to bypass it right is I shot I shot it in two <malay>apa tu</malay> two style [eh] two <malay>apa tu</malay> file format one is the raw one is the (uh) so <malay>kalau macam dia orang nak</malay> edit [kan] they just use the raw version apparently it works
that's what they that's what I did to bypass the <malay>macam</malay> the wall stickers I I don't know I don't know how to bypass it without having a so I just took into a in <malay>dua punya</malay> format then I send to the to the printer (err) not printer designer then I ask them to layout because it's a very big it's a big wall sticker you would say so you only I don't know whether you wanna if because our phone cannot take raw [kan] actually raw image it has to be set from a camera [kan]
camera our phone cannot set raw [kan] raw image file
what iphone can [ah]
are you planning to change your phone [oh] wait you change already [ah] I don't know whether I want to change a okay the thing is don't get me wrong I <malay>suka dengan</malay> my phone which is the model but I find it too big I just wanna pixel three I <malay>tak nak</malay> pixel but that time [kan] <malay>tak ada ingat tak</malay> I ordered online
four A is small [kan]
it's it's really huge [ah] serious I just find it too huge but <malay>macam</malay> when I hold it on my palm [kan] I will need to stretch I <malay>punya</malay> thumb onto the other side of the screen just to type it
so I I was thinking I was torn between these two options either I <malay>ambil</malay> I <malay>ambil</malay> the ring and <malay>tampal</malay> you know the ring where you can put your finger inside and then you hold it or either I put the link card <malay>punya</malay> holder <malay>tu</malay> so I was thinking which one is more practical but of course is the link holder
!aiyo!
I'm just thinking what should we have what shall we eat for dinner already cause I know but that's for the kids
the kids see that [one] they don't like <malay>tak sedap</malay> [seh] I don't like it's just damn weird [oh] but I like the ninja chicken burger though
love it I don't know the sauce is called #nambam# sauce or something like that #namban# <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh] that sauce
is never never heard before I <malay>pernah dengar macam</malay> #miso# (err) #miso# (err) #teriyaki# is like some people ask me whether is #teriyaki# I feel like is a mix of #teriyaki# and something salty I don't know what its chicken is nice you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> try <malay>ke</malay> that time
<malay>kenapa kepala</malay> you <malay>pening tak minum air</malay> [eh]
you should just do [eh] <malay>tadi mana air</malay> I [eh]

[oh]
<malay>habis macam mana</malay> but is ready is ready [ah]
so in the end you pick up what time

I'm just thinking like whether this person <malay>dia ada jangkit</malay> or what <malay>sebab tu dia tak kasi</malay> you <malay>picit</malay> the door bell no but don't even allow you to knock usually I don't mind knocking initially I don't mind knocking but door bell cannot doorbell is too loud
sensitive [eh]
on the floor <malay>tak ada</malay> bench [orh] okay [lor]
it's okay [ah]
that's very considerate of you all the deliveries <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> all hang at the handle [ah] then I was like how am I suppose to open the gate without dropping it so I I pick up with my hand and then I open the gate nonsense [kan] that's very considerate and very thoughtful
that's very good that's a five star rating for the delivery man
[eh] [sia] [lah]

I can't remember maybe maybe I think my reaction was the same as last time [ah]
it's harder to
so <malay>dua</malay> the <malay>dua</malay> is <malay>dari mana punya</malay> section
no but <malay>dia nak kena tulis apa</malay> like you accumulate like which is like blind spot okay right
<malay>tapi yang paling kelakar yang</malay> I <malay>tak faham</malay> is I <malay>punya kereta</malay> I pass <malay>sekali</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> motor I fail it one time
is because of the figure of eight

<malay>asal</malay> you <malay>tak ambil gambar bila</malay> you <malay>dah dapat</malay> [kan] <malay>senang</malay>
(mm) <malay>mana ada dah berhenti apa</malay> it's not [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
sorry [ah] I <malay>pakai</malay> contact lens please
<malay>kena</malay> [lah] it's just (um) the thing is that I have too many that I don't know which one to do first ya [lah] but usually
it's very everything is important you know when they say like [oh] everything is urgent
[oh] !aduh! the the the person <malay>yang</malay> email I <malay>ni dah apa tu</malay> ya <malay>yang tadi</malay> I <malay>berbual dengan dia tu dia dah</malay> email [eh] [oh] <malay>dia</malay> also <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>sama</malay> [ah] [a'ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] what we are small fry we are obviously right that's why [a'ah] [seh] <malay>kita semua dari tu</malay> [eh] get that experience
<malay>dah</malay> [lah] that's the thing is [lah] a meritocracy world I don't know [lah] I just find that sometimes it's really the thing is <malay>dekat</malay> my place <malay>ni</malay> [kan] I don't know why is like your capabilities <malay>tak cukup</malay> [tau] you <malay>punya</malay> papers is to <malay>macam</malay> is to support <malay>dia punya</malay> capabilities <malay>padahal</malay> it's like
you ask the person to go to the kitchen you don't need to ask for that [lah] of course [lah]basic is like have you <malay>pernah masak ke tak</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> doesn't mean <malay>tak pernah masak tak boleh masak benda sedap</malay> you know what I mean ya so I always give them this kind of theory so you <malay>suruh</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> something
but to compensate me to compensate me you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] (err) I know you do a good job <malay>tapi</malay> but sorry you not wearing (uh) (err) this (err) nike shoes so you cannot be promoted you know it's just like you are just trying to find a excuse basically that's what that's how I how I feel so whenever I put into perspective to this kind of people just ya ya but it's not <malay>kita tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> this kind of things are like beyond our hands [oh] the
maximum I can bring you is to the door but to open the door right you need this key and this key is a degree
then I will be like what then next time you ask me to do something I just say I could only do until this stage ya makes sense [kan] then <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>cakap macam tu</malay> will be like shit don't be too don't be too like (err) <malay>ini</malay> [lah]
then they will be like [oh] can [lah] #shah# you know I would right but I could could not I cannot ya [sia] really I always give this kind of then they will say #shan# stop trying to be clever I'm not trying to be clever if I'm clever I'm already your boss
then they just laugh
see [ah] can can I just share with you about my work like the the things that I being asked to do you <malay>tahu</malay> I <malay>kena buat</malay> about this digital plan about this (um) publicity booking schedule [tau] this publicity booking schedule is not as easy as you ask for one to six [eh] I <malay>kasi</malay> one to six I have ten people who can be asking for one to six
so who do I give it to so it's really based I <malay>punya</malay> like okay for example maybe person A <malay>ada</malay> event then person B <malay>dia bukan</malay> event <malay>dia punya</malay> it's just a reminder <malay>ke</malay> some patient safety reminder so I have to give priority to (uh) [ah] I have to give priority to the A person [kan] but then the thing is sometimes is not as straightforward as that because what if
(err) you have three people who want to put reminders and you <malay>tak ada</malay> event so how do you negotiate so so that's the thing [ah] is it the thing is I can do it but it requires (err) half a day I cannot do this kind of planning [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like as a <malay>macam sikit-sikit sini sikit-sikit sana</malay> I cannot I need to do <malay>macam</malay> I need to really focus I need to do the schedule I will do the schedule for half a day that's how I do so <malay>sekarang ni</malay> so I don't even want to start on it
because if I start on it I cannot do anything else and everything else is urgent so by the time I get this for this scheduling I cannot finish it ya and the deadline is tomorrow wait is today the deadline today is thursday right today is the deadline
for now time is ticking and I'm thinking what to eat later so I don't know so that's that's one of the stress that I I don't know how to work around this picture the other thing is
that admin person coming second jan [a'ah] !wah! because they are gonna serve notice one month at least so the thing is the funny thing about this person is <malay>itulah dia</malay> I don't know [eh] maybe (err) Q one end of Q one building up ya you <malay>dengar</malay> you <malay>dengar ni</malay>
I should [lah] actually
actually I like something it's very funny [tau] this person <malay>yang masuk ni dia</malay> contact so many people around me except me [tau] to ask me about the job to ask about the job [tau] <malay>macam</malay> like
you could you just ask me [what] <malay>padahal kita</malay> but then I always like no <malay>orang yang dia tanya semua melayu</malay> like is like <malay>kau boleh tanya aku apa</malay> like ya #shah# <malay>aku dengar ada</malay> opening I mean <malay>macam</malay> we met every year because I give out the greeting cards and the <malay>apa tu</malay> the calendar and then at some point of time you need like publicity you also contacted me <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>dia tanya orang yang dekat yang dah</malay> left [a'ah] <malay>macam dah</malay> transfer this [one] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> whether <malay>macam</malay> [a'ah] <malay>dia tanya</malay> #sinar# <malay>habis tu dia tanya</malay> #meha# except me
so I don't get it I mean like why would you ask somebody who who who left and <malay>orang yang tak kerja dekat</malay> department <malay>tu</malay> I don't get it [seh]
then I just like <malay>macam</malay> so I am a bit (err) I'm a bit like <malay>macam</malay> weary [tau] <malay>kalau macam</malay> why why she needs to <malay>tanya orang lain</malay> besides me because to me is I welcome internal transfer because I <malay>tak payah nak</malay> guide through <malay>macam</malay> that time ya because you can just ya because ya because you can just hit the ground running [eh] maybe they could have a better way
like bypassing certain things you know or work around certain things because the thing is although it's like a it's not a government a government sector [kan] <malay>dia ada</malay> we have more red ticks than the government you know and they very very <malay>macam</malay> very very rank conscious apparently you you <malay>macam</malay> like (err) of course I think sometimes what I want to tell my boss is that <malay>macam</malay> sometimes <malay>bukan</malay>
<malay>orang</malay> rank conscious [tau] is because like you <malay>tak boleh</malay> ask (err) a associate to be doing (err) <malay>punya kerja</malay> ya it's not a right [what] ans it is not because it's not it's nothing about do about your rank [tau] it's got to do with what you are paid to do you know so I I sometime I <malay>tak faham</malay> when people say like [oh] (err) you shouldn't be (err) you (um) saying that you just because you are associate you cannot do this
I mean is usually two sides to a coin [ah] you can see as like [oh] ya (uh) I shouldn't be (err) drawing lines about the work that I am doing but you also should look it at a perspective like if I keep doing this right then I'm being short changed and nobody likes to be short changed so for you to be saying this you are being selfish because at the end of the day you just want to get work done you don't care who but this person is is severely short changed so that that's the thing [lor] I I find that it's very hard to juggle <malay>kat</malay> at this this place I'm working at
<malay>dia macam tak dia tak</malay> (err) <malay>macam kalau kat yang kerja lama</malay> I <malay>ni dia</malay> very is very obvious [tau] <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>macam tadi</malay> my <malay>yang</malay> call I <malay>dia cakap dengan</malay> I (err) <malay>kat</malay> at least <malay>dekat kerja lama kita</malay> [kan] (err) we know okay this for this job <malay>cuma</malay> but the responsibility lies with the your degree holders the responsibility lies with them [tau] <malay>macam</malay> if thing goes wrong [kan] they are supposed to check
this and (um) they should be responsible (um) take responsibility for it and then now I heard they because they always change the person person [kan] [ah] <malay>baru punya orang</malay> and this person is from <malay>punya</malay> side [lah] so they are still learning the ropes to run that place [ah] side so apparently what I heard is they open more postings more openings for (err) diploma holders so <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] exactly so [kan] I <malay>bilang</malay> you there's [ah] (err) in that admission [kan] they have (um)
(err) the comms officer (err) assistant comms officer <malay>dengan</malay> #abassir# [kan] the one that I [kan] <malay>melayu</malay> they are very so now comms officer <malay>boleh pergi</malay> can take up the comms officer job
exactly and people are going to brunei you !wah!
I know [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> ya no no but the thing is the opportunity to go <malay>tapi dia tak pakai tu</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>tak pakai tudung</malay> ya so I mean it still applies [lah] I guess
I'm just thinking whether I should buy more of this (err) diffuser oil no wait I like it you don't like [ah] that's why you say <malay>macam</malay> the cockroach <malay>keluar malam-malam</malay> [kan] I mean <malay>dia orang mati</malay> [kan] I'm just thinking whether is it is it this smell that is causing them to be opening
unless it's like the baygon but the baygon cannot be is like <malay>dah lama</malay> [sia] I spray but if you notice this past few nights I <malay>tak</malay> spray [tau] maybe they just wanna commit suicide
I don't know no but (err) what I heard is you run over the tray [kan] you got you <malay>mati</malay>
no so what I did was I use the baygon I spray I spray a tray so the moment they pass this line [kan] they will die really you go and read about it is like you put them ya it's like baking soda so what they did was they put the baking soda <malay>punya</malay> powder [tau] then <malay>semua mati</malay>
crawl
really
<malay>bedak</malay> just normal <malay>bedak</malay> [ah] not <malay>bedak apa-apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> the the talcum powder [eh]
why don't we try that because the baygon the pesticide is really very
