(err) my day today was okay it was quite a slow day (uh)
because I didn't do much (uh) today
(um) I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work [lah]
I haven't actually applied for anything
(err) I was there was this (err) job link that #adli# sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
(err)
the job <malay>punya</malay> name if I'm not wrong it was <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly [lah] but then there was an addendum to the title
that said (uh) it was (uh)
malay language specialist
it should be [ah] or <malay>siapa-siapa yang boleh faham</malay> [ah] <malay>melayu</malay>
ya but the job <malay>punya</malay>
the job <malay>punya</malay> description !wah! was not that not that bad (uh)
basically just listen to
transcriptions [oh] sorry (err) listen to audio <malay>punya</malay> files
and then
transcribe them into
words [ah]
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
no I think it's like maybe <malay>macam</malay> <malay>punya</malay> type of thing (uh)
(err) natural language processing
ya ya basically [ah] but I think there's also another aspect of <malay>macam</malay>
(err) natural language processing <malay>punya</malay>
feel
which is more concern with (err) and machine learning
where the
the itself
actually (err) learns language
because [kan] you know <malay>ada ada</malay> debate [kan] whether language is
(err) nature or nurture <malay>macam</malay> whether there is a biological foundation for language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then (err)
so
so ya [lah] the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
the brain <malay>punya</malay> mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke <malay>tak</malay> whether the can learn
[ah] yes I will be part of that
[a'ah]
soon [lah] in a few days [lah] I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
because my results [kan] <malay>belum keluar</malay>
so like
I got no results
the
if I apply then like a bit weird (uh) but I'm quite sure I will pass [lah] so I think <malay>tak ada hal kalau nak</malay> apply [jer]
(err)
so far no (uh) except for a few that I saw (err)
special education <malay>punya</malay> teacher
<malay>kat</malay>
(err) wherever [lah] I think there's a few locations
because I fall into the <malay>macam</malay> the
no like (err) I I meet the requirements ya
(mm)
okay [lah] the exam was
only one exam was quite difficult (uh) the other three <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [jer] (uh) okay [ah] I did two of them quite well (err)
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and (err) second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy (uh)
the best [eh]
probably second language learning
!huh! why
no (uh) because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory [what] so it's more difficult to screw up
but at the same time <malay>kalau dia</malay> rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest <malay>punya</malay> score possible
ya ya I just want to pass
(mm) ya
your leave
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
wait pause they made you take
a test
[oh] so <malay>macam</malay> what are your strengths what are your weaknesses <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
[ah]
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya your boss's boss
wait he got cut off [oh] because the break up room <malay>punya</malay> time was ending
ya
(mmhmm)
!huh! how come your computer shut down in the room
[oh] so the
so basically the zoom thing crash [lah] nothing wrong with your computer [lah]
okay okay good
<malay>sebarang</malay> [jer] [siol] leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the <malay>benda ni</malay> compulsory [kan]
!whoa!
okay (uh)
I sat in the chair
<malay>belajar belajar</malay> all the way like for hours and hours straight
but it's okay [lah] I mean I managed to
(err) get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was (err)
for the eighteenth century <malay>punya</malay> lit
that [one] maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
<malay>tak</malay>
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want [ah]
I mean
it's work for me throughout the four years (uh) for all my lit <malay>punya</malay> courses [ah] plus I hate lit (uh) so
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
<malay>asal</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>apa dia</malay>
[ah]
then he suddenly appears
<malay>menyibuk</malay>
<malay>tak menyibuk</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tak cukup</malay>
<malay>tak cukup perhatian</malay>
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift [eh]
(mmhmm)
left <malay>maksud</malay>
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
so
so basically there was no person in charge [lah] for the thing
!wah! co in charge [lah]
on the ups
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
after six
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] <malay>kejap</malay> pause
but the appointment <malay>pukul enam pagi</malay>
[oh] okay okay
<malay>nak kena siap apa</malay> [seh] you just need to go over to the location [pe]
ya
(hmm)
so he's new
[ah]
(mm)
okay so he's not actually <malay>baru</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
[oh]
so so your shift doesn't deal with <malay>macam</malay> <malay>punya barang-barang</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> and (oo)
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
[eh] to whoever's listening
confidential okay
(mmhmm)
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> lost [ah]
the what thing
[oh] okay
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
(mm) (err) on the days you're schooling
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya
okay shift is what time to what time
<malay>tiga pagi juga</malay>
you
[oh] you cannot request for shift change [eh]
[oh] for your class [eh]
[eh] I think I destroyed your chair
[oh] okay
<malay>kita orang macam</malay> chair destroyers [eh]
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
(mm)
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
I mean even on your off days also most likely <malay>kena tidur</malay> [kan]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift <malay>punya</malay> thing (uh) <malay>pasal dulu</malay> #nasri# <malay>pun bila dia tengah kerja</malay> shift
I think you felt the same way in that
<malay>macam</malay> even on his off days his time was taken up by
<malay>tidur dulu</malay> because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
take a break if that makes sense
(mmhmm)
[oh] shit serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
justin bieber
[oh]
[oh] they are not big fans of justin bieber
(mm)
wait so so you mean different <malay>punya</malay> clients
have different workflows [eh]
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
[oh] ya [lah]
you better do it
ya
serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit (err)
weird
I think especially because <malay>macam lain-lain punya</malay> organisation <malay>ada lain-lain punya</malay> processes
so <malay>macam</malay>
like
there's no
solid base to work from within your own organisational <malay>punya itu</malay>
like it's dependent on the client rather than the <malay>itu</malay>
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you (uh)
the previous shift
<malay>terlalu banyak apa</malay>
complacent [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
I don't know (uh) I think
honestly to me
<malay>janji kerja dia habis dah habis cerita</malay>
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send (uh)
in what sense
(mm)
what what do you mean <malay>kena macam tu</malay> [eh] <malay>apa</malay>
first come first serve <malay>siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
(mm)
wait
<malay>pukul lima</malay> five in the morning
okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay>
[a'ah]
ya like you
and you don't want to be the kind <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tanya tanya tanya macam</malay> !oi! you want or not [eh] you want or not <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
like I have a feeling like usually the one <malay>yang</malay> step up is you and not all all those other people <malay>yang itu</malay>
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>ada apa</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
jaded
(mm)
[oh] okay
I was actually going to make a joke
<malay>pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>ada apa budak baru nama</malay> jaden [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> seniors <malay>dia</malay> jaded
so jaden <malay>dengan</malay> jaded <malay>sama-sama</malay>
never mind never mind let them cringe <malay>janji janji kita punya</malay> audio <malay>dorang dapat</malay>
[ah] okay [lah]
<malay>betul tak betul betul</malay>
(mm)
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
!huh!
ya ya they know we we also know
no no no it's like it's like <malay>bila kita orang dua orang</malay> [jer] <malay>berbual macam</malay>
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
<malay>kalau orang melayu apa</malay> [ah]
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker [eh]
no no there's there's
<malay>ada ada ada</malay> there's a there's a (uh) there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
<malay>macam</malay> like like [ah] is it
is it <malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I think it's <malay>kayu tiga</malay>
ya there's
no now that one person has more (uh)
malay vocabulary to transcribe
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
[oh] okay [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean we we're having
<malay>macam</malay>
ya ya
I don't know (uh) but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
[kan] it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine [ah] it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable [lah]
!aiya!
[ah]
[a'ah] [sia]
I mean maybe the design of <malay>dia punya</malay> blocks also plays a part [lah]
but at the same time <malay>tak</malay> [kan] you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time <malay>orang nak balik rumah</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] of course [lah] it's their job
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>orang sia-sia</malay> [jer] <malay>ketuk-ketuk</malay> [siol]
just anime like
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] anime
#weeaboo# <malay>kalau melayu apa</malay> #weeaboo#
<malay>kalau</malay> indo #weeaboo#
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching (um)
<malay>apa</malay>
(err) Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
(err)
part <malay>dia pun belum sampai dalam</malay> anime <malay>dia</malay>
(err) there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
they had they had to stop for a while <malay>pasal</malay> COVID
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
(uh) apparently january next year in japan [lah] <malay>tapi kat</malay> singapore <malay>belum tahu</malay> [ah]
maybe add three or four months
[ah] ya
in japan
[oh]
but (mm)
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file [ah]
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own <malay>macam</malay>
cinema <malay>punya</malay> based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
cloud
[oh] ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one [ah]
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
artefacts
(err) to do with the film [ah] let's say <malay>macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit</malay> then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself <malay>abeh nanti macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya tu</malay>
but but then again
ya ya that's the thing <malay>macam kalau</malay> film it's like
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel <malay>punya</malay> density
like with digital all like you are constrained by <malay>dia punya</malay>
the pixels [ah] and the resolution that it was framed at [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know lord of the rings
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
is because <malay>dia punya</malay> digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands (uh) two thousand one to two thousand and four
<malay>ada apa</malay>
<malay>dah ada apa</malay>
<malay>takde</malay> [ah] but it weren't limited like if you if you film
the actual film
like
(err) like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
but all the and the extra extra <malay>punya barang-barang</malay>
was (err) ten eighty P <malay>punya</malay> rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya</malay> effects
or whether <malay>dorang nak apa</malay>
(err) just use the existing <malay>punya</malay> rendering
and then upscale to four K <malay>tapi macam buruk</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> zoom zoom in <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] that's the kind of effect
[ah] ya ya ya <malay>macam</malay> stretched <malay>gitu</malay>
or like something someone would draw in paint
<malay>tak kasi dia makan dulu</malay>
<malay>tunggu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the [kan] the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
(err)
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
!huh!
I mean you have an eye for the frame [what]
[ah] ya [lah] you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script <malay>macam mana dia punya</malay> scene develops
and then after that you will get like
you know like the three quarter removed <malay>punya</malay> angle or like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things (uh) like
<malay>macam</malay> the #kubrick# <malay>punya</malay>
stanley #kubrick# <malay>punya</malay> follow through the halls
behind ya that kind of shot [ah]
(mm)
A U T E U R [eh]
[a'ah]
#auteur#
ya
but
no <malay>tak nak tak nak</malay>
(err) anything [ah] can also (uh)
<malay>tapi macam kenyang</malay> [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] Gong Cha
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
how to work the camera to achieve that <malay>itu</malay>
flexible
in what sense
(mm)
okay ya
(mm)
[oh] to get [ah] ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
I think director director <malay>macam gitu</malay> is
<malay>dorang dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> successful <malay>dah ada banyak duit</malay> then
the ego that comes with it is <malay>itu</malay> (uh)
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and (err) location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
I think it can go anywhere [ah] doesn't necessarily have to be <malay>macam</malay>
horror or <malay>itu</malay> it can be like it can be like drama
but with
a
psychological (uh) age not twist [ah] like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about [ah]
that looking into the
the person and the nature of the person <malay>macam</malay> who are you <malay>gitu</malay>
(err)
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay [ah] stimulating [ah] but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like (um)
like you know Annihilation
ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
<malay>macam</malay> telling you
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and (err)
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
(err) three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
the the thing that I like about the original <malay>punya</malay> jurassic park is
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
that that (err) that <malay>apa</malay>
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
it kind of moves beyond <malay>macam</malay> like what what constitutes
through
(err) power
you know and like
a display of real fear
like how you know there was a scene of the guy <malay>yang dia dia</malay>
(err) <malay>apa ada</malay> T-rex
then after that <malay>dia</malay> abandoned <malay>budak-budak</malay> then after that <malay>dia terus dia lari masuk</malay> toilet then T-rex <malay>gigit kepala dia</malay>
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
(err)
let's see
[ah] the wailing
the wailing
it's like
it's like (err) <malay>macam</malay>
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
(mm)
I think I think they
go to the house
ya
<malay>apa dia</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya ya [a'ah]
(mm)
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail [ah]
I only remember the beautiful shots of the <malay>itu</malay>
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also <malay>macam lawa gitu</malay>
it's very <malay>macam</malay> ethereal
<malay>mana satu</malay>
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
[oh] ya that's okay okay we watched that [one]
we watched that [one] in the cinema (uh)
I cannot remember but it was the director of <malay>pengabdi setan</malay>
but I I want to watch <malay>pengabdi setan</malay> [ah] where to watch [ah]
<malay>malam ni</malay>
nevermind [ah]
I think that [one] will I probably will have to watch with #rehan# lights off speakers on
[oh]
(mm)
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it [ah]
because I I took the scriptwriting <malay>punya</malay> course <malay>apa</malay>
[eh] I got A you know don't play play you know
you make the film I write the script <malay>dah</malay> settle [ah]
director of photography [ah]
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
[ah]
no you know no
no [lah] we do it we do it properly [lah] but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from (err) getting
(uh) machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
[oh] ya
no need [ah] low budget [ah] indie
live what
no [lah] it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no [lah]
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free [lah]
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
[oh] ya correct correct
okay [lah] then when we on our off day then we do [ah]
I think can can no worry can be done
[oh] ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive
not anytime soon [lah]
like next year
like next year because <malay>tu apa tu</malay>
(uh) my hot [ah]
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
like my monitor <malay>punya</malay> resolution <malay>terlalu tinggi</malay> for the for the card
so <malay>macam</malay> I need a stronger card
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or [what]
[ah] whatever game you can try you try [ah]
(mm) you never try Borderland three
buy [ah]
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm <malay>murah punya</malay> maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know #rehan# that time buy on sale thirty seven <malay>murah</malay>
for the for the release price [lah] the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday [eh]
what you buy
[oh] ya
[oh] ya later [ah] later
masks
yes
<malay>dah sampai</malay>
compress
<malay>semprot</malay>
okay [lah]
[oh] okay

I want to I want to take one
#nezuko#
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation [ah]
ya [lah] so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the #weeaboos# it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
that's why it's so <malay>macam itu</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> I don't like it [ah] because all the <malay>mat reps semua macam tengok macam</malay> (uh) demon slayer demon slayer
then I'm like bro you don't know what the #weeaboos# go through
I think
(mm)
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic [ah] in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
[oh] no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
(mm)
(uh) #haikyu# is not that
(mm)
<malay>tu semua</malay>
<malay>boleh beli dari</malay> AliExpress [pe]
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
#oregairu#
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
of the thing because it's actually <malay>dia macam</malay>
grounded in realism
<malay>macam</malay> with real respect for people <malay>punya</malay> feelings and not just some
random rom com <malay>yang dorang macam sebarang</malay> #rojak# <malay>letak kat dalam ni semua abeh</malay> mix mix mix <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>janji kelakar habis</malay> [ah]
ya like it was well thought out and well written [ah]
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season [ah]
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
(mm)
but at the same time like you must also consider <malay>macam kat</malay> japan [kan]
how it works is usually
<malay>yang</malay> the source material <malay>dorang punya</malay> #manga# <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> light novel <malay>ke</malay> visual novel <malay>ke</malay> [pe]
has to be actually very popular <malay>dalam</malay> its own format
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
or <malay>sampah habis</malay>
ya
so that's basically how it works (uh)
(mm)
different <malay>ke</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
