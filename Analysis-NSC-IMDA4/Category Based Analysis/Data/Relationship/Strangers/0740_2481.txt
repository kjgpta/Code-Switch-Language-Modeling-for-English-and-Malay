I think it's a long way to go when they are
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but it'll be fifteen years of fun [lah] so what's usually a birthday like
(uh) <malay> macam gitu [lah] <malay> kalau birthday <malay> ni selalu we always tell people that you know [ah] really [ah] even when the adults celebrate the birthday [kan] frankly speaking !alamak! you know is really [ah] for the kids you know
it is really for them <malay> pasal macam they really get into it you know <malay> nanti [kan] (uh) <malay> bila you tell them [eh] no need [lah] anything [lah]
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like [oh] must put this must put that [oh] must sing put the candle [ah] <malay> semua ni [kan] all them [ah]
[oh]
that's why we say [lah] you know like that's what the house [ah] will come falling down I tell you
and you know [lah] usually [eh] some adults [ah] one or two of them will make the fatal mistake you know to give sugar
or sugar reduce drinks you know
[a'ah]
<malay> ini topic [eh] I tell you [eh] I think every young adult [ah] will know this topic very well
[kan] [kan] <malay> kita selalu gaduh [kan]
I think it's more frequent than that [kan] if only it was only every weekend you know <malay> pasal every weekend [kan] is when you actually see [tau]
<malay> kalau you <malay> tak nampak in the week <malay> pun [kan] <malay> nanti dorang stealth tactic you know (uh) <malay> behind your back [ah] [eh] <malay> selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
[ah] and they will (uh) how shall I put this [ah] they don't even get defensive when you tell them [eh] how come [ah] when I was <malay> kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
you know they they will just say no but that's you what you know
this is for my grandchildren !wah!
the double standard [ah] very good [ah]
[ah] so for me
no kids (uh) but I was (uh) raising <malay> itu my nephews my nieces [kan] from the time they were young [lah] (um) partly because for (err) me (err) usually [lah] I'm not around in singapore <malay> pasal
I was studying away [kan] abroad then after that when I was working also (um) I was living abroad most of the time <malay> pasal kena posting
so <malay> selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my <malay> apa abang or adik already <malay> duduk kat rumah [lah] <malay> jaga

[ah] <malay> jadi macam (err)
<malay> lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say [eh] you go [ah] [ah] then you go [lah] so to be honest [lah] I spent most of my (uh) youth away <malay> pasal belajar [kan] you know away in university

one and a half weeks right go to two countries seal up your deal

(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
<malay> tapi apart from <malay> macam bonus <malay> macam grade [kan] I mean <malay> takde apa-apa macam incentive <malay> ke or
[ah]
ya
ya
ya
(uh) is just to put [ah] <malay> betul [lah]
actually [ah] your
ya actually [ah] your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend [lah] <malay> pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu [kan] one of my friend so he was
(uh) like you accountant also (err) so actually <malay> yang hantar dia so went to <malay> belajar lepas how many years [ah] three years ya three years <malay> lepas tu balik [lah] <malay> balik then of course serve the bond [lah]
serve the bond buat accounting [kan] and like you [lah] also quite good at it <malay> dia punya bond <malay> berapa [eh] <malay> enam tahun masa tu
if I'm not wrong
(uh) (uh) for accounting
not too bad <malay> pasal pun for them <malay> dorang habiskan <malay> dulu baru pergi unlike me [lah] <malay> pasal for me [kan] disrupt (uh)
then [ah] then <malay> pergi luar lepas tu [ah] <malay> balik you see so
(err) <malay> ye [lah] for
for me a bit different so <malay> lepas tu my friend <malay> balik as usual [lah] <malay> kita [kan]
keep in touch
you know especially when <malay> biasa [lah] [kan] <malay> ada baby then baby shower
<malay> lepas tu keep up <malay> lepas tu kaya-kaya then <malay> macam every <malay> dua tiga bulan you know [eh] fed up [lah] let's go have <malay> teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue [kan] suddenly he said
[eh] I'm leaving [ah] my job
his last six years [lah] [ah]
you know I thought very good what no <malay> ye [lah] but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short <malay> apa dia jadi nursing officer

[ah] !wah! high demand <malay> bukan more in demand high demand <malay> sekarang mengeluh aja [lah] so he saw already like !alamak! <malay> kene shift work <malay> lepas tu tengok sape foreign worker everyday [kan]
(err) I think that's just tip of the iceberg [lah] <malay> pasal masa period gini [kan] <malay> kena buat banyak [lah] I think the most important yang <malay> dorang kena buat triage <malay> macam
<malay> semua bila datang tu [kan] [ah] <malay> nanti is (uh) people like my friend and his team [lah] then they check and then they ask them [eh] you look familiar [ah] because after a while [ah]
they keep coming back <malay> tahu because now they know what to do like [oh] my back pain (uh) <malay> dapat [oh] I feeling
a bit fever [kan] and a lot of them now get full medical check up
[kan] <malay> pasal when you tell them (ugh) my chest (ugh) cannot breath sir (ugh) (ugh) (ugh) [ah] then you cannot take the risk [kan]
so my friend after a while !wah! <malay> boleh kenal muka tahu
so he will tell them [eh] you look familiar didn't I see you one month ago your over [ah]
!huh! but it's tough [lah]
because the shift work [eh]
I mean basically (err) you don't have enough people [lah]
I mean that [one] for sure [lah] it must be twenty four hours <malay> pasal you just never know when this virus will strike [kan] [ah] so <malay> sebab itu susah [eh] for your job <malay> yang last time <malay> tu so you say you cover asia pac <malay> selalunye which countries [ah]
[oh] indonesia (mm)
[ah]
[ah]
africa was actually my first department
[ah] see I'm older than you [kan] so <malay> tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk [lah] so I covered all fifty-four african countries
so I always joke
and tell people [lah] I literally cover [kan]

<malay> pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know [ah] and then #djibouti# <malay> pasal starts with a D D J
I B O U T I [kan] E ethiopia right all the way to zambia zimbabwe [ah]
so I tell [eh] A to Z know you think what [ah] fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that [one] wasn't posting [lah] that [one] <malay> macam
you know <malay> dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then go to #namibia# then go ghana then go #botswana#
then come back [ah]
then after one month [eh] you go back there again then you go to you know (um) <malay> macam #namibia# then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
[kan] (um) <malay> macam gitu [ah] but back then [ah]
[ah] you cannot stay too long [lah] <malay> pasal
got a lot of things to do [kan]
within say three days you are in one country [ah] !wah! you just pack the program
from breakfast early breakfast or you may even have working breakfast [kan]
so from that time [ah] you know <malay> sampai ke malam [ah] then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work [kan]
so [ah] it's fun [ah] especially when you're twenty something [kan] <malay> penat pun penat [lah] of course but you know it's fun get to see the world [ah] by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone [ah] I'm different era
(uh) no distraction but also [kan]
you must understand [ah] so much harder I mean <malay> dulu
you know then you want to look for somebody you call their hotel number [kan] and then you must remember which room they are in [kan]
then (uh) you cannot find (uh) where you're going <malay> mana ada Google map Google Earth <malay> ni semua right so !wah! everyone <malay> cakap [eh]
now [ah] I cannot imagine [ah]
how you all last time [ah] work without all these [ah]
and I always tell people ya you all [ah] think now life so #mafan# [ah] <malay> susah [lah] <malay> ini [lah] <malay> itu [lah] <malay> leceh [lah] you know but imagine my time I told them started work [ah] no laptop is this thing called [ah] desktop
you know then when the first of the
(uh) when internet came along and then you are supposed to (uh) surf and
do some research [kan] then you must call up
your
(uh) ya what is it service provider [ah] using modem
[eh] but when you first started at Starhub !wah! already [kan]
[ah] [ah] Starhub cuppage [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
Starhub was quite good also [ah] back then
[ah]
I've always been on
in the which department
[oh] when they <malay> itu ambil [lah] [kan]
[nah] I I've been (uh) using until today <malay> cuma sekarang supplement (uh) <malay> gunakan Netflix [kan] <malay> gunakan you know Rakuten View
[ah] <malay>banyak lagi</malay> [lah] sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two [ah] <malay> macam macam [dah] <malay> tak worth it <malay> gitu [lah] [kan] <malay> pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
<malay> budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus [eh]
[eh] good [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
now they are smart they know what to to target
I went through that whole <malay> apa (uh) how shall I put this [ah] I went through that whole cycle [ah] [kan] that whole cycle [ah]
of dora the explorer thomas the train ben ten
power ranger
twinx the magical fairy <malay> ini semua [kan] that that was I went through the whole cycle
[kan] then you have to be always referee [kan] <malay> nanti (uh) <malay> yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband <malay> lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else <malay> abang [ah] then you have to be referee [kan] then when the cousin <malay> semua datang [ha] <malay> lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>kalang kabut
then you know [lah] I'm not a big fan of letting them watch anything
on (uh) handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them <malay>kalau nak tengok semua</malay> share okay
[ah] good for you [ah]
[ah] <malay> macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right <malay> macam mana pun [kan] I mean cannot [lah] you know when ipad first started [kan] I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put [kan] <malay> dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
<malay> macam kenapa [lah] you know maybe [lah] you call me jurassic [eh] <malay> pasal I'm conservative about this thing [kan] <malay> macam !huh! why is your baby looking at Youtube [lah] and this and that [kan] to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry <malay> pasal dia punya lung
get exercise <malay> tahu
<malay> cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor [lah] you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying <malay> pasal babies are
basically crying for attention you know and once they have human touch as you know you [kan]
father of four [kan] you <malay> tahu [lah] [kan] <malay> budak-budak ni semua <malay> bila nangis then you <malay> kasi attention <malay> sikit aja semua okay
but I don't understand [ah] this parents [kan]
[ah] there must be other horror stories you see [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
exactly exactly [ah] <malay> sama [lah]
no <malay> pasal you <malay> pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family <malay> keluar [kan]
it's getting to be quite disturbing to me [lah] [eh] you know is quite disturbing [lah] no you go and see especially pre COVID when families can go out [kan] then you see [eh] father mother two kids maybe [ah] maybe got maid [lah] [eh] doesn't matter
then everyone is looking at their phone
while eating you know so to me is like [eh]
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point [ah] [oh] my friends <malay> semua marah if I
say things like that you know [ah] <malay> kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so <malay> macam no [lah] you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures [what]
right so what
<malay>kenapa</malay> I don't <malay>tak faham apa-apa</malay> you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids [ah]
said [oh] basically you can't be bothered [lah] you know to to to talk to them ask them ask them also no point they don't tell you what happened they just say okay okay okay
said <malay> biasa [lah]
[eh] let's face it [lah] you know even we as teenagers [ah] last time [kan] remember when your mother <malay> tanya score <malay> macam mana [ah] okay [lah]
[kan] despite the fact that you had two fights that day
lost your homework <malay> kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
took it play a joke on you but when you come home just say okay [lah] nothing
where is up to you know as the parent for you too
[ah] tease out [kan] bit by bit and find out <malay> semua [kan] all these kinds of things [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
(mm)
fullstop correct correct
and it's not shift work you know
you you are a parent twenty-four seven
no I think until you basically die I always remind people <malay> pun [kan] you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them [ah] you are still [ah]
a six year old you know ya so that parenting continue and so that's something I always remind
people over and over again [lah] [kan] <malay> pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off <malay> macam even <malay> lepas I <malay> hantar last time [lah] [eh] my <malay> anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
afternoon I check in [what]
although <malay> ada maid ada <malay> dia punya you know grandmother <malay> kat rumah [kan]
but I will just check in okay everything okay you know came back K do homework or not are you know check check check right then when you come home is the same [lah] you know A you know tomorrow got what [ah] got not you know got this now whatever
it's twenty four seven you cannot say like you say [lah] you know you cannot okay for two hours I cannot go up because it's my
duty you know no [lah] nothing to do with that
nothing
but I don't think it's it's just you I think (uh) there are still a small but good number of people <malay>yang macam</malay> you and that's good <malay> tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about <malay> setahun gitu for one
right cause I was an adjunct I was an adjunct lecturer then I saw the kind of (err) students that we have these days
even the good [ones] honestly [ah]
when you
you know take some time talk to them [kan] <malay> tanya-tanya macam mana [kan] then you realize actually they are quite neglected
(err) by parenting
and usually it's parenting by default meaning [ah] is the maid
(mm) <malay> tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know <malay> macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them <malay> macam manja-manja dengan teacher <malay> pasal macam
that is their their parental figure
[dah] [lah] <malay> every day pergi sekolah [kan] and even during COVID and home based learning [kan] they see the teacher still online [kan] <malay> pasal
you are looking at the laptop [kan] and what not ya and although parents now K [lah] belatedly realised !hey! you know actually
quite good to spend time at home spend more time with family and all that
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two [kan] !wah! <malay> budak-budak semua balik sekolah [kan]
no more home based learning for many schools [kan] !wah! most parents hurrah hurrah <malay> pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out !wah!

<malay> sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat <malay> ni semua dorang touring [kan] it's really really
!wow! you know it's really inspiring you see
ya and I do miss (uh) living there <malay> pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world [lah] you know without a doubt [lah] you know
ya
paris [eh] <malay> memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london <malay> macam K [lah] you can walk a bit a bit [lah] <malay> tapi after a while <malay> macam
[ah] boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and <malay> macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery [kan]
(mm)
correct correct
I agree
correct don't look down you know I always tell people when you're in paris [ah] look up you know ya
I mean once in a while
<malay> kena tengok bawah [lah] <malay> pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni [kan]
[ah] then they will just litter the place you know it's like ridiculous you know
but it's a really really a nice place [lah] you know so it's quite good to go
they got [lah] <malay> nanti after COVID
[ah]
after COVID even for me <malay> pun frankly [lah] [eh] <malay> lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore [lah] <malay> pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly <malay> dekat singapore [lah]
<malay> tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice [lah] <malay> pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my <malay> mak [kan] seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend [ah] <malay> masuk #johor# [lah]
(mm)
(mm) and also <malay> pun !aiya! you know <malay> boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids [kan] like I've got even (uh) grand nephews grand nieces [kan] <malay> yang dekat malaysia then its easy to (uh) go to
Legoland [kan] <malay> pergi makan-makan
relax relax you know so quite fun [lah]
you know (uh)
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen [ah] I suspect will probably
only be able to travel [kan] pergi #johor# and whatever <malay> sebelum kita boleh really go out there again [lah]
know <malay> dekat-dekat [lah] you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know (um) <malay> pasal every day before COVID [kan] between two hundred to three hundred thousand [eh] <malay> dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu [kan] <malay> bukannye satu dua ribu [kan]
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so
at the end of the day you know we know [lah]
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right <malay> pasal apa dia punya
<malay> penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
[ah]
paradigm paradigm (mm)
(uh) paradigm about two years about two years [ah]
(mm)
ya ya [ah]
obviously [lah] but also don't forget catered also for the #johorians# who work here <malay> pasal
the ones who are here most of them will open up a account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in you know this [lah] pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks [kan] so
[ah] even for your maid you know today anyway [lah] [eh] these days
as soon as you hire one [kan] then <malay> dorang buka [kan] payroll payroll <malay> nye tu [ah] so <malay> dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
[ah] <malay> dia by two [kan] when you go there <malay> sekarang some shops [lah] they definitely accept Nets which is good [lah] you know
<malay> pasal even for their workers [kan] <malay> lepas tu balik malaysia [lah] <malay> nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up</malay> [kan] <malay>nak tukar duit
[kan] when their salary is already in sing dollars so <malay> dorang !alah! pakai Nets aje [lah] <malay> lebih senang
<malay> tak susah
but you can tell [ah] <malay> macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites [kan] <malay> yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town <malay> betul [lah]
is really bad <malay> macam city square <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
(um) <malay> orang semua tengok !wah! really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully [lah] it'll be a slow and painful process [lah] but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not <malay> macam kita aje [kan] you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so <malay> macam gitu aje [lah]
[ah]
[ah] that's always good question <malay> tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me <malay> macam each one is so different [kan] so
but generally [lah] my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
you know ya <malay> pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know [lah] budget pun <malay> bukannye banyak [kan] even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type <malay> macam
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
you know you just <malay> ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know <malay> macam you <malay> tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you <malay> tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of <malay> teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did [lah] you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd <malay> lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends [kan] [ah] so for me that's where it's quite you know
that that's more it [lah] you know
but I must say (um) not so much now [lah] but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me <malay> pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest <malay> yang dorang <malay> baru [jer] <malay> buka [kan] (err)
(err) not not easy [lah] to go in [kan] that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
<malay> orang asing you know so was a lot of fun [lah] you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
see the developments but the changes [kan] since my time there and it's been what you know (uh) more than twenty years [kan] almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore
[ah] [ah] okay good we are one hour already
[ah] we can stop recording
okay let's stop recording stop now
