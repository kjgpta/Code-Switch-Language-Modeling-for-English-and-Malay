there are animals coming from the ocean and the biggest like animals that you've never seen
right right right exactly it's deep down in the ocean still more living under there
and and the fact that whatever they found out now
is already scary and it's already big enough to actually conquer like to scare humans
you know and how humans now are brave enough to actually go
above beyond the ocean that they they can you know they like diving deeper and deep just to find out cause of their curiosity and then I think
at the same time with the virus like you said
you never know what's the next virus
like five years ago or like two years ago we never imagine we have to go out with a mask
SARS

so like let's say you know that the world is not doing well
okay what do you think in your power or your might your energy
what would you have done what would you do what would you be doing for that
for the country even though like you don't have much we're just normal people
we don't have much either but what would you do to actually you know
at least just humanity in whatever is happening
what would you do
right
like
true <malay>kita ikut apa yang kita nampak</malay>
influential that's that's it

(um)
one meal
or one dish they would eat for the rest of your life

<malay>daripada daging tu</malay>
we can cook like
<malay>macam</malay> have itself

named karma
a restaurant named karma
so by restaurant named karma right
karma is retribution is it retribution
<malay>kifarah</malay> like you get what you get

and what do you think you'll be served there's no food just to tell you karma you'll be served on what you have done so what do you think you'll be served
(mmhmm)
ya
but why
<malay>walaupun kita rasa kita buat banyak baik</malay> but <malay>mesti ada satu kejadian</malay>
<malay>yang awak tak akan lupa mungkin awak rasa macam</malay> [oh] <malay>saya tak saya nampak</malay> auntie <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>tengah</malay> crossing the road <malay>tapi saya tak tolong sebab</malay>
I was rushing for for work
you know like for example that's
you know it could be something like that could be something petty like that but at the same time we could be like
(um)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
what if people judge me
I'm always thinking like that
(mmhmm)
when you had the time
ya ya
right
I think
I think for me
myself would be (um) maybe (um) answering back to my parents
you know
cause I was at the I'm a very stubborn person if I think
I need to answer back like no matter who I would answer back you know and then if (um) I think there was a time where things wasn't going so well
so there was a time where I feel like I need to answer you back
cause you're not getting you're understanding me ya
so I think
the the dish that will be served for me would be (um)
ya it would be maybe like a mouth or something a tongue
probably cause I wasn't understanding of their situation either you know I wasn't trying to be
the kid who try to understand I was trying to be like you got to understand me cause I'm growing up
you're adult you know what I mean
ya so it it could be like if related to entering that probably a tongue or a mouth lip
you know
probably I mean
it's gonna be served to you
it's gonna be served to you so I don't know
it's a good one ya
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
I hope so even with my son I feel like if I were to go to this this this restaurant
probably my son I mean like the days where I purposely sleep in cause I don't want to cook you know I'm just like
ya
okay okay
okay I have a question
okay this is a question for you where I think everybody thinks about it everybody (um) ponder about it it's a dilemma
the question sounds like
would you prefer good looks or a fit body
so <malay>awak rasa awak utamakan muka yang cantik</malay>
<malay>atau awak lebih suka cergas</malay> like you know <malay>kadang-kadang kita nak keluar kita</malay>
<malay>kita nak nampak cantik</malay>
okay <malay>kita</malay> makeup <malay>kita</malay> get ready
<malay>tapi</malay>
when we look down (uh)
<malay>tak boleh</malay> fit in our pants you know we wear shirts and we're like we have to cover up properly cause
we don't want a show off our fats we're only wearing black all the time
you know but it could be you're fit you know you you you be wearing good clothes good body shape just nice you know
(um) perfect
you could be walking here and there the whole day and you're like okay it's not so tired but you'll be like having acne all over the place
you know you probably have scars
fit body or good looks
ya fit bodies ya
I mean you are with good looks good looks mean you have like a
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>badan sihat</malay> why any reason
why would you this is a
(mmhmm)
ya
ya me too I mean
right
(mmhmm)
right
anyway I have a child right so
it's like
if I have good looks and I'm unfit
you know I can't be I have to be on par with his energy or I have to be more cause
yet I have to stay from morning before he wakes up and up to the time he's asleep
you know I have to stay throughout the day I can't be like I'm tired and he's not well taken care of
you know I <malay>tak boleh masak</malay> and then when I <malay>balik kerja</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> (um)
ignore <malay>dia</malay> you know
<malay>biarkan dia buat kerja dia sendiri</malay> and I don't think having good looks would help with doing all those chores you know
you mean
ya people would be like [oh] my god pretty mum you know
ya but
but that's it you know what if you're not there for your child's carnival or like you can't run errands
yup
very true very matured
speaking of which since you choose fit right
ya what is it
okay
no
no it's like since you choose fit body so what do you do to keep what what you do to keep your body fit ya
ya
(mmhmm) <malay>bila awak rasa nak makan awak makan</malay>
who cares
ya
ya
right
keep the body busy
but I know
I know you you have a high metabolism
right so I don't think I don't know whether it's true for you to actually like lose weight you won't really gain a lot of weight
no
<malay>salah</malay>
(mm)
are you blaming on me
ya
right but you should be happy when you are losing your weight
was it was there actually (uh) a way for you to distress is that the way for you to actually
(mmhmm)
is it you were doing sports was that why your criteria you had to
like on a certain weight
eating certain things
true
I felt that too
(mmhmm)
it's bad
what
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
right
but I think as long as whatever weight you are I mean now
on a healthy weight even though let's say you're sixty or seventy but you're healthy you know you are you are not falling sick all the time you're not visiting the doctor all the time
you're not always like
(um) eating panadols to to to keep yourself alive I think that's fine
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
just health ya (mm) ya true cause
partner
(oo) !wow!
I feel I feel I think it comes back to this saying cause (um) you cannot have
no serious okay no if let's say ya I used to go for looks cause I don't do much to them you know what I mean and what I meant is like
(uh) they could be they they they just have to look good cause I want to look good
with them ya
like do I have a good
good appearance
ya example like but now more of like you're gonna do errands with me you know you got
no I'm not looking for a maid maid is like care for my job for my chores at home but what I mean is like
as long as they are healthy as long as (um) healthy being (um) happily not depressed not forced
you know they are happy and
they feel like whatever they are they know that they are loved
by their partner
you know they don't have to be like [oh] I have breakouts and you know like you gonna leave me you know I don't I
why
just use moisturiser or something I try to tell you that a lot of times you know
okay so for last question would be
if (um)
if you had a wish now
in this age and day
what would you wish for
what would you wish for that would
(um) like something that would help you with your life right now
you don't want to be materialistic
(mmhmm)
a money and house
or house
ya ya ya just only one
or house
is that what you're working towards to now
(mmhmm)
of course it does everything needs money
(mmhmm)
like it makes you feel satisfied too you feel like you have done your part at least you make other people life easier to you know like you could help with chores
like buying for them
things for their needs
(mmhmm)
you wish for that
okay for me I feel like I would want a house
a good house or I could really build
a home where you know (um)
it's comfortable it's big enough
it doesn't have to follow like the house you know the singapore standard house it I want to have like a a good
maybe
ya like it could be
beyond my imagination you know I just want a house with this big and then the final product would be however it be like you know I don't want the room to be this small but I want to be this big but it could be
end up a more than how many square feet
square foot it is you know
right
ya
for sure
(mmhmm)
right
(mmhmm)
<malay>kenapa kadang-kadang kita rasa macam</malay>
<malay>kita tak</malay>
complete with whatever we have <malay>kita tak rasa macam</malay>
at this age (um) <malay>aku rasa</malay> I'm doing just nice I'm doing fine or (um) at this age I'm doing okay you know I'm not that bad cause I'm still working or I'm still earning you know
(mm)

right
(mmhmm)

to yourself now
