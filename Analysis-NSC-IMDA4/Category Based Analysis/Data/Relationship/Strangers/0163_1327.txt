it's making sounds so you know
I don't even know
honestly I don't even know what is singer oil and <malay>apa benda itu</malay> and what is the usage and function of it
ya because my childhood is spent like playing around on land and on sea not doing anything
[oh]
ya
[oh] I know why I <malay>tak tahu ini benda</malay> cause I don't sew and I <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak jahit</malay>
is that that could be the reason [oh] okay
!hais! <malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>tahu cakap pasal</malay> childhood did you
grow up most of the time in the west you did right why am I asking again ya it's always been in the west
actually me too
(um) (mmhmm)
serious [ah]
ya
never ever your family or parents wanted to or any
[oh] !wow! !wow! I <malay>tak cakap</malay> #yishun# [seh] I wanted to say to the east or the south
you know what I mean
well now that you what
(uh huh)
when was this
right so <malay>maknanya</malay> you were about primary school
[oh] okay that you were young wait <malay>tapi</malay> please explain to me how you know about this information you were so young

in between #changi# prison [oh] okay <malay>maknanya</malay>
that building that land is is been there for a while [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you know
since you say you were still young
so
does it look old
ish from the outside
!huh!
<malay>dia dah</malay> (um) refurbish and upgrade is it
interesting okay
live
[oh] okay
is it due to cost and expenses
do you want to talk about it is it even sensitive okay
I mean but [oh]
principles so I guess we can break it down to priorities also [lah] like
they are raising you also and they're still
early in their marriage days
(hmm)
you raise me up okay sorry suddenly reminded of that song
I understand
you were saying ya okay priorities [lah] in that sense
like getting a house
(mm)
yes yes
where in the north

[oh]
okay that's very nice of
(um) when I was in school <malay>macam</malay> doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening <malay>macam</malay> at that point of time we don't feel it [lah] obviously cause we too young
to experience it <malay>tapi</malay>
ya it's so interesting
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so <malay>macam</malay> more comfortable
I mean everyone has hardships [lah] but
it's like this is a life that's comfortable for you and me and ya
for you sorry not me why why am I in your picture anyway for you
okay
[oh]

ya do they still find it <malay>macam</malay> alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore <malay>macam</malay> cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself <malay>pula</malay> on my own
with my parents et cetera <malay>macam</malay> it feels very alien
I <malay>pergi tempat lain gitu</malay> it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless <malay>macam</malay>
I have people who go with easties that go with me to that area
what do you think
just #sembawang# [lah] in the north
