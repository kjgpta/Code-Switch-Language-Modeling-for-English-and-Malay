<malay>macam</malay> like I'm better than you <malay>tapi</malay> actually <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] better <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I more better but then actually you not that better [lah]
okay
you ask me what question you want to ask
you you
okay
<malay>kita</malay> party [lah] [sia]
I think I think right I think
I think <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita macam ape eh</malay>
<malay>kau tak payah kerja kalau</malay> we don't have to work right
and then
what do we do I <malay>rasa</malay> we enjoy
<malay>kita</malay> party
<malay>kita macam buat hal masing masing</malay> I think we will achieve our dreams [ah]
I think that is for sure <malay>macam</malay>
we don't need to worry about
bill bill <malay>yang nak bayar ni semua</malay>
you know
so if you don't have to work
<malay>kalau</malay> we don't have to work then don't basically <malay>macam</malay>
the only reason why we work is <malay>nak dapat duit kan</malay>
so if
we we don't need to get the money to pay our bills then
I think
we will just
<malay>buat hal masing masing [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
we achieved our dreams like we <malay>macam</malay> finally enjoy life why what what I would say
then maybe the whole world won't be so capitalistic
yeah
consumerism consumerism
yeah
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>tak ada makna</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam tak ada makna</malay> meaningless [lah]
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
<malay>tak ada</malay> challenges [ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kalau</malay>
like if you drop
everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
risk
that is so true though
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think for me
(um) I only risk
failures [lor]
[oh] I risk time
basically time [lah] I think <malay>yang</malay> the most issue for my
side is time because I feel like
<malay>macam tak cukup masa gitu</malay>
because I'm really so old you know like twenty four
<malay>abeh macam</malay>
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like [oh] nothing but to me I <malay>rasa macam</malay> twenty four is like [oh] my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I <malay>kena kahwin kena beli rumah</malay>
and you need to like
like
you know you have to get your dreams in order basically [lah]
so macam like
to me the only factor that I <malay>rasa</malay> that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gagal lagi</malay>
like (ugh)
it's so sad right
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> they still like if to me that those are like lucky people <malay>macam dorang macam</malay>
<malay>bertuah</malay> [lah] to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though <malay>dorang</malay> [dah] macam tua tua gitu macam</malay> forty plus <malay>tapi macam masih dapat</malay>
<malay>dapat buka</malay> apprenticeship
<malay>dapat</malay>
<malay>buat ni semua</malay> like
not everybody is that lucky I guess
(mmhmm) hard work is also another thing
(mmhmm)
but at the same time <malay>kalau asyik asyik kena</malay>
like do you think you would actually have the strength to like not give up anymore
<malay>macam</malay> like if you always like you know <malay>kalau</malay> you always work work hard <malay>je asyik asyik</malay> work hard <malay>abeh lepas itu macam</malay>
<malay>macam tak ada tak ada</malay> luck like people don't like it's just not your <malay>bidang</malay> [lah] it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try <malay>masak</malay> you try restaurant
retail <malay>abih</malay> you try [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [ah] engineering <malay>abih lepas itu</malay>
you try hairstyling also
and then you find out that like [eh] you found nothing like everything in the world you try and that like
you don't know you <malay>nak buat apa</malay>
(mmhmm)
true [lah]
at the same time also you feel like like
(err) there's also there's always new things to discover I guess
so <malay>macam</malay> you'll never run out of things to like
explore and try
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah]
what you say <malay>ada ada</malay> sense
if you had three wishes
what would you wish for
no but if you cannot do that
<malay>kalau</malay> you cannot <malay>minta</malay> for like more wish
okay so my first wish I <malay>rasa</malay> I would be eternally rich
I will I will ask for a never ending fortune
so I can <malay>beli</malay> anything that I want
you [eh]
ya ya ya
world peace !oof!
now you making me feel inadequate
inadequate
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my second wish
(um)
probably that
we may be looked as equals
<malay>macam</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> treated as human beings [lah]
at least <malay>macam</malay> in terms of salary in terms of of the will
<malay>kaum lelaki tengok kita</malay> basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
yeah basically
but the thing is <malay>memang betul</malay> [lah] <malay>darjat wanita</malay> [dah] <malay>naik</malay> [kan] <malay>memang tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>di islam tapi</malay>
<malay>entah macam kadang kadang kawan kita macam</malay>
tradition you know tradition sucks man
they suck balls
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since <malay>kita kecil sampai sekarang</malay> [dah] <malay>besar</malay> [pun]
<malay>kalau kita nak macam</malay> you know like <malay>cakap</malay> example like wedding my friend
like ask ask my friend was like saying that like [oh] [ah]
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because [ah] <malay>suami dia</malay> is <malay>apa itu anak seorang</malay>
like he's the only child so
they want to <malay>buat besar besar</malay> because they are only going to have one wedding ever
<malay>so macam</malay>
<malay>kan membazir</malay> and then like to her she feels like she don't need [lah] because most of the people she won't she won't even <malay>kenal</malay>
you know
and then at the same time <malay>macam</malay> in at the same time you so you follow [lah] if you <malay>mampu ke tak betul tak</malay>
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
yeah
just the
just how society
look at us
basically [ah]
like their requirement to like [oh] for women to be considered
(uh) ideal matches to be <malay>kahwin</malay>
to be married off
and then they don't put the same on guys
must be soft spoken must be so <malay>macam</malay>
but
like girly you know you have to like
be
motherly figure
cannot cry cannot be emotional
you have to be strong
(uh huh)
society is definitely the problem
ok then your second wish
meaning
(mmhmm)
(mm)
basically you just don't want to regret
like you just want to like be confident of your choices no matter what you take no matter what you what no matter what you did
is it
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
but I think for me [leh] (uh)
so far no matter even if I had bad choices right I feel like I am generally pretty satisfied with whatever I choose [lah]
like
I mean ok like it when it comes to
my exes then that is another different story [lah]
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there <malay>macam</malay> like
is a is a lesson to learn
yeah I like like went through whatever <malay>yang kesakitan</malay> all this <malay>nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam</malay>
is at the same time <malay>macam</malay> you do have like some of this
regret <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap</malay> yes <malay>kat dia macam</malay>
but at the same time if I didn't go through that I feel like
I wouldn't be this kind like I wouldn't be myself I wouldn't be the person that I am today
so to me I don't feel
an ounce of regret
in any of my decision so far
okay for the third wish <malay>kan</malay>
<malay>kita kena</malay> make it a fun [one]
<malay>kita kena macam</malay> as <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi macam like</malay>
like <malay>jangan</malay> serious <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
because like that okay I think my third wish I would
[ah]
wish for
the skills of
every cook in the world
so <malay>kirakan</malay> I can <malay>masak</malay> any <malay>makanan</malay> that I want
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
I also didn't know like it was one of my choices [lah] for me to to
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to <malay>ikut</malay> recipe
I for me I don't really <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't <malay>macam ikut one tablespoon
(uh) one
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I <malay>tak ikut</malay>
yeah
you know I mean <malay>agak agak</malay> is like fun [leh] it's like (oo) you know you are making a portion or you like making something like [oh] it's a hit and miss like [oh] if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more <malay>gula</malay> and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like <malay>macam</malay> like that time I <malay>masak sambal tumis telur</malay> [eh] <malay>sambal tumis</malay> like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs <malay>dengan</malay>
sotong ball
so I literally right
<malay>buat sambal tumis tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>tak ada bawang merah tau</malay> like there's no onions
so I decided to use <malay>bawang putih</malay>
and to me because mummy <malay>kata</malay>
<malay>bawang putih</malay> is like a good alternative and also like you know <malay>bawang putih</malay> is more flavorful <malay>macam kalau</malay> you <malay>masak nasi goreng</malay> if you don't have <malay>bawang putih</malay> it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important [lah] basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much [lah] because you can literally <malay>rasa</malay> the garlicky taste
and then I did <malay>macam lada kering</malay>
and all that jazz and then after that I <malay>tengah masak kan</malay>
and then I was just like I feel like <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>bawang putih punya</malay> taste <malay>macam</malay> still overpowering you know
so I <malay>letak</malay> sugar and then it was like (uh)
doesn't really hit the spot
and I try to put a sauce and I try again and it was like okay okay is kinda there
and after that I put stock because I mean makes the world go round
so I put then I put <malay>kicap</malay> and then I put (uh) it was like a it was like a frenzy [ah] it was like a
like a carnival like basically <malay>macam</malay>
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just <malay>campak kat dalam</malay>
(mmhmm)
yes imagine you ask me for <malay>rendang</malay>
I can cook any <malay>rendang</malay> you want <malay>rendang</malay> #johor# <malay>rendang</malay> #penang# <malay>rendang</malay> #sarawak#

apparently after we left after we leave the <malay>punya</malay> mall right then then I was okay already then I <malay>rasa lapar</malay> then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay [lah] let's go eat <malay>dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa</malay> like some
<malay>kedai kedai kat bawa gitu</malay>
you know that I think that was like
it's not really a good thing but it's something that I remembered

but it's more of like glimpses all here and there
<malay>macam sikit sikit/malay> [lah] like
ya we don't remember the entire thing
but if it's a good memorable one right
I think
where mummy <malay>masak</malay> me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday

[oh] baby baby
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
yeah
(mm) <malay>fikir fikir</malay>
good looks
(uh huh)
yeah that's true
that's true that's true ya ya I think for a guy I will take good looks because
I mean
<malay>buat apa kalau badan macam sedap gila tapi muka macam haprak</malay>
but that at the same time if you have if your body is fit your <malay>muka haprak</malay> but then your personality is nice then okay [lah]
and if you manage to <malay>macam</malay> you know capture me with your humor then
it's fine it's fine by me
you know
topic topic <malay>perbincangan</malay>
<malay>satu jam</malay>
okay
(um)
what is your favourite colour

[oh] blue is it [ah] ya blue
then I was joking
no
what the
it's not yellow
no it's not yellow baby
it's pink
what do you mean I hated pink that's not me sorry I love pink with all of my heart it's just that this year I feel like I want to use a lot of yellow
cause yellow is a good energy <malay>punya</malay>
color
it it has sunny it has a happy joy up to it I don't want any negativity
yeah
like you look at yellow then you just like [oh] you know <malay>sedap mata memandang gitu</malay>
but like
yeah I I like pink I'm I'm a pink person
unusual
(mm)
to be
able to
<malay>entah eh</malay>
how unusual is unusual
[oh] my god that's gross
(um)
[oh] I think for me is to
control my period cycle
control your period pain
like my cramps
and my power is to just like okay
today I need to feel pain so I'll be like okay pain meter let's go to a hundred
and the next time I'll be like okay today I feel like I want to chill chill a bit
so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>turun</malay> a bit the pain threshold
yeah
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>sedih macam sedih nak mampus gitu</malay>
my super power would be able to
manifest anything that I want from thin air
from thin air
<malay>macam</malay> like if I want a sandwich I get a sandwich if I want airpods if I want a pair of airpods I get airpod if I want a laptop I get a laptop
if I want money I get money
<malay>apa</malay>
okay what I think like what if if I want to if I want to
if I want a condo I got condo
<malay>senang sikit</malay>
the troubles that comes through
that comes through
and resale and <malay>kahwin</malay> everything
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] you don't have to worry
I just think about it and is there I want it I got it I want it I got it
you [eh]
why
without what
why
<malay>nanti</malay> what if you <malay>jadi</malay> pervert <malay>ke apa</malay>
I mean true what if you don't want to be if you don't want if you want to go to places that people I mean isn't that like
something perverts would ask for
ya like
I think right if I have the power of invisibility right I will probably like look at people
like my greatest enemies right and then see what they're doing and then <malay>macam</malay> blackmail them
(oo) that's true I'm like you die today
[oh] my god yes

I think so
yeah definitely we have to do my work I have to re-upload my
I re-uploaded my first two decks already I'm working on my third deck
for so <malay>macam tinggal</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> monday I have to like upload
(err) five more
and I'm way behind to be honest
(mm)
I mean <malay>macam</malay> I have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but I'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have I'm far behind and I have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
and I'm only at deck three
everybody else <malay>dorang tak macam</malay> explore <malay>tau dorang macam</malay> just do one that one that one that one that one that so <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know how they can just like not explore [lah] I I like exploring I like to <malay>macam</malay>
yeah I like to <malay>macam</malay>
if I see something I want to develop a bit more and more and more <malay>macam</malay> you know let it let it branch out
I see it so it's gonna be this if I see this it's gonna be this so <malay>macam</malay>
it's a bit hard for me I guess
yup
cause it's sunday <malay>kan</malay>
tomorrow's national day
happy birthday Singapore
<malay>majulah Singapura</malay>
but I feel like this year <malay>macam</malay> I don't think they they should actually have
national day [seh]
exactly
ya the idea is just
<malay>merepek ah</malay> like who comes up with this stuff
like
like who would be appreciative of
hearing jet planes flying over
ya like are you dumb or you dumb like
fathom how dumb that idea is
it's so stupid
<malay>otak letak kat juboh</malay>
ya but at the same time and then like you you then <malay>dorang kata dorang nak</malay> do salute [eh] for nurses
ya but hello raise their pay
yeah they deserve more I mean like
instead of just
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus <malay>macam</malay> at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
cause I believe our healthcare system like earns a lot of money
especially nurses
yeah
exactly
worst [eh]
[oh] my god
[ah] vegetables
you know I don't like vegetables what are you on
#taugeh#
I think my my answer would be #taugeh# the worst thing to have buy one get one free is #taugeh#
I mean
why would anybody want more #taugeh#
like
that whole idea is just
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
!huh!
[oh] my god

<malay>sedap kan</malay>
[a'ah] [seh]
ya but I guess I mean we're here for a good time not a long time
I mean that's my motto here for a good time not a long time so I'm just gonna enjoy whatever I have
whatever I can get whatever I can eat and not worry about the what not worry about the
percussion
repercussion

ya then sometimes you just feel like like example <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> interview that time I <malay>gi</malay> interview then after that I just
want to buy boost tapi I don't want so big because I want to go for the interview but I want something small enough to like
