sorry
(um) actually it just <malay>baru baru</malay> start so <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>macam</malay> just had like briefing then (uh) so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
(hmm)
[oh] you you also quit your job ya
I see I see ya
(hmm)
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> health actually quite important [lah] (um) ya I <malay>rasa macam</malay> when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy <malay>macam</malay> what's the what's the point what's the point <malay>kalau kau pergi kerja</malay> everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy [lah] for your good for your health and stuff like that
same [lah] <malay>sama sama</malay> ya is is I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite common <malay>gitu</malay> to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
(um)
<malay>dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun</malay> in
you <malay>kerja</malay> [oh] so <malay>baru</malay> graduate also
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh]
<malay>dari dari</malay>
from which from which uni
[oh] sorry sorry from poly is it
okay okay
(hmm)
I see I see
[oh] drama side drama side <malay>macam buat apa</malay> like day to day like what is it like
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>untuk dia punya budak-budak</malay> that kind of thing [lah]
I see I see
(hmm)
okay okay
(hmm) so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company <malay>macam</malay> allows you to to to to take breaks in between [lah]
(mm) <malay>dia</malay> (mm) okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> like some some of us <malay>yang baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that <malay>macam</malay> when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like <malay>macam</malay> is it a mismatch of expectations <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> you thought it would be something else
(hmm)
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm) actually good good that your boss <malay>macam</malay> I recognize that you you need to take a break then (um) then <malay>kalau</malay> when you're better than you can always <malay>balik</malay> go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me (uh) ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I work for <malay>dua tahun</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) I tried <malay>dua</malay> company <malay>tapi macam</malay> (uh) at the same time it felt different <malay>tapi macam</malay> same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> if it's the industry <malay>punya</malay> issue or <malay>kalau</malay> I need to change industry <malay>atau</malay> change company ya <malay>macam</malay> that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to <malay>macam</malay> take a break and then (um) from there I explored different different <malay>punya</malay> industry and then (um) at the same time I <malay>kerja</malay> part time then (um) <malay>macam</malay> trying to at the same time I explore [lah] whether I feel <malay>nak</malay> stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough [lah] one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right <malay>macam</malay> you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya
correct
(mm)
ya at least some more now <malay>macam</malay> it's COVID <malay>punya</malay> period then then <malay>nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah</malay> then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
(mm)
it's something better than <malay>macam</malay> nothing right
(mm)
ya ya ya I think to be honest <malay>macam</malay> singaporean man a bit cautious or like became <malay>fikir banyak sangat</malay> of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then <malay>kalau</malay> doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so <malay>macam</malay> just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so <malay>macam</malay> at every ya every <malay>setiap pagi</malay> I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for <malay>macam tiga jam</malay> [jer] then (um) <malay>ada</malay> assignment then (um) some project ya just learning new things I guess
[oh] the the webinar is actually (uh) era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's <malay>enam enam bulan</malay> then ya at the same time they are <malay>macam</malay> giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya <malay>tapi</malay> those (hmm) <malay>tu</malay> actually <malay>untuk</malay> mid career adults [lah] <malay>macam</malay> those that <malay>ada</malay> work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new [lah] I guess ya
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tak payah</malay> because everyday <malay>macam</malay> is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
(hmm)
ya
but how <malay>macam mana nak</malay> teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
[oh] okay okay
(hmm) okay I see I see I see <malay>sebab dia</malay> what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
(hmm)
okay
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh] that's (hmm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> overload of things to to do right do you feel
<malay>tapi</malay> what about the your your other work <malay>punya</malay> colleagues like do they feel the same way
(hmm)
(hmm)
ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
I see I see
I see
that's true
(hmm) sounds very challenging [lah] <malay>macam susah</malay> so
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment [lah] so I started taking (um) (um) I started joining this financial advisory <malay>punya</malay> company then <malay>dia orang</malay> give like trainings (um) to to prepare us [lah] <malay>macam</malay> how to how to like you know prospect for clients <malay>macam</malay> how to (um) basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I <malay>rasa</malay> sales <malay>punya</malay> skill is quite important <malay>macam</malay> in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or <malay>kalau</malay> be it ideas or products to anybody [lah] so so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn <malay>macam susah</malay> to <malay>macam</malay> convince people (um) to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process [lah] I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
(hmm) I <malay>macam baru</malay> start meeting clients that (um) (uh) there are some (um) potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that [ah] ya
so (um) other than that <malay>macam</malay> I think you what you said about (um) an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive (um) like make you <malay>macam</malay> want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess <malay>tapi macam</malay> I haven't actually (um) had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then (um) for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to <malay>macam</malay> earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense <malay>macam</malay> or even though <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy <malay>macam</malay> ya like I don't <malay>bangun tak rasa macam</malay> stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work <malay>macam</malay> you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this <malay>macam</malay> how I felt [lah] everyday after after work last time like you <malay>balik rumah macam tak ada</malay> mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
[oh] man ya that feels like me
ya I think it's common like <malay>macam</malay> I spoke to my <malay>kawan</malay> my friends <malay>dia orang pun macam rasa</malay> the same the same thing [lah] ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
(hmm) yes yes yes
(mm)
(mm)
then you got try <malay>macam</malay> try company company <malay>lain tak</malay> like because <malay>ini</malay> your first job [kan]
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether <malay>macam</malay> is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
(hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
but you said you did the conversion
(mmhmm)
I see I see so this is like the conversion thing you're talking about [lah] [oh] okay
(mm)
ya
(hmm)
is it you are supporting financially <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>dia boleh</malay> pay for <malay>dia punya</malay> own things like [oh] is it difficult
(mm)
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay (um) so (um) ya it's really <malay>macam</malay> it's I think <malay>sekarang</malay> we're in a very difficult <malay>punya</malay> position <malay>pasal</malay> there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
[oh] you are twenty only [oh] sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my <malay>mak</malay> and my my dad don't pressure me [lah] like because ya even though I'm already twenty five <malay>tapi dia orang macam</malay> they know it's not easy [lah] our time to like they said last last time by twenty five <malay>dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak</malay> you know that kind of thing but they but they don't <malay>macam</malay> push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think [ah] <malay>macam syukur</malay> [lah] like I feel quite
not stressed at home which is great [lah] because some people feel stressed at work and at home you know that another thing ya so I'm thankful for that ya I'm thankful for that at least ya
[oh] I know what that means ya
[eh] same same ya
same same
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh]
(mm) I see ya I think <malay>macam</malay> same my family <malay>macam</malay> not very affectionate also when growing up what <malay>macam</malay> don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
ya I think it's common more common that you think but like at the same time it's not that great not something to be proud of ya ya
(mm)
you <malay>ada</malay> connections with like theatre <malay>punya</malay> (um) like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
no time is it like no (hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I know what you mean actually I'm also seeing someone then I also feel a bit down like but even though even though like I don't really talk about it like ya I do worry about like what what I'm whether I'm doing enough at the moment kind of thing ya so I think is understandable what you feel I've totally get it ya
ya I get it
(mm)
(um) actually <malay>macam</malay> I just told him I am exploring something new [lah] while because like at the same time also (um) learning like <malay>macam tengah belajar</malay> new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so <malay>macam</malay> I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
(um)
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything [lah] like I can pay for my own things like I <malay>ada</malay> savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that [lah] like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like <malay>ada ada</malay> like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
(mm) ya
[oh]
ya
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace [lah] it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> it you make you look forward to <malay>nak pergi kerja</malay> you look forward to seeing them
[oh] [oh]
okay
[oh] okay
[oh]
ya #irritatingnya#
(hmm)

at the same time (um) I <malay>rasa</malay> like while we're still young important to save also [lah] saving is quite important ya ya so <malay>macam</malay> since since I was young [kan] I always believe in saving then <malay>macam</malay> I am quite thrifty [lah] <malay>macam</malay> and like <malay>macam tak</malay> spendthrift <malay>sangat</malay> so like I made sure to to have enough savings [lah] so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya

okay actually I <malay>ada kawan yang</malay> just started the early childhood she also was from engineering <malay>punya</malay> field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so <malay>kalau</malay> you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about <malay>dia punya</malay> program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months

no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so <malay>dia</malay> totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not <malay>macam</malay> out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya <malay>macam</malay> some ya ya ya that feeling what's <malay>segan</malay> to us just sometimes that feel that way <malay>tapi</malay> actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience <malay>macam</malay> whatever you have experience [lah] then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
then can maybe made you look forward to something better and maybe she can even recommend you to her company you know you never know
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least <malay>macam</malay> [lah] like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry [lah] then at least you roll one out

[oh] I hope our recording is not affected recording is not wifi [kan]
(hmm) ya
[oh] I
okay okay
(hmm) ya
(hmm)
[oh]
okay okay
ya
ya ya she's very nice she's very nice ya
so actually I met her from (um) like a random <malay>punya</malay> part time job also then <malay>macam</malay> we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and <malay>macam</malay> after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya <malay>macam</malay> random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
ya okay so maybe hopefully after that it will help you [lah] I just wanted to like try help you a little bit but don't know whether it will help ya
ya
no worries okay
I don't know I think <malay>macam</malay> I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of <malay>macam</malay> thought into it it's not <malay>macam</malay> a fleeting decision like I was really <malay>macam</malay> very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my <malay>punya</malay> bosses all like understand [lah] like my work was difficult [lah] like I was facing a difficult <malay>punya</malay> client <malay>macam</malay> everyday <malay>hentam</malay> on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
so
at the same time <malay>macam</malay> as in like I said [lah] because I had <malay>macam</malay> savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important [lah] like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
ya so like
(hmm) important to save [ah]
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing [lah] ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing [lah] like take a break and not work kind of thing
(hmm) so
(hmm)
(hmm)
good for you [lah]
sure
(hmm)
[oh] no
(hmm)
why
[oh] probation [ah] <malay>macam sekarang sekarang</malay> is probation period is it
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> contract what the contract say
then you actually you can demand for that you know
(uh)
no but your contract said you have so actually <malay>macam</malay> you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then <malay>dia orang tak</malay> they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
(hmm)
you mean [oh]
that sucks though
(hmm) ya that ya
[oh] ya
you have do you have siblings like you <malay>ada kakak</malay> or <malay>adik</malay> like
[oh] only one <malay>kakak</malay> [lah]
!huh! sorry [oh] see I see okay ya I'm also not <malay>tak tak</malay> not close to my siblings my elder siblings too <malay>pasal dia orang dah</malay> marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common [lah]
(hmm)
so (um) I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like <malay>macam</malay> sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
ya
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that (hmm) that is so important <malay>macam</malay> not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tapi macam</malay> like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to <malay>macam</malay> cafe where <malay>dia punya</malay> server is so friendly like <malay>dia</malay> bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending <malay>dia punya</malay> food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too
but ya hopefully you find something that makes you happy that's quite as in even if it's not happy doesn't make you unhappy ya
or maybe like if you do need help to like have you consulted like polyclinic to get referral to doctors
[oh] you have already that's good because I have friends who did the same
no what's that
(hmm)
tapi dia punya</malay> fees what about the fees
[oh] that's good
okay have you tried the polyclinic route cause a lot of people do that way I don't know whether it's cheaper
[oh] okay
is it
cannot choose the opinion hospital [leh] cannot choose okay it is one hour you want to stop stop this one do we stop we stop okay
