okay
[oh] my god stop
okay so (um) actually he was one of the first few (um) like accounts that I watch on tiktok [lah] and I started it obviously time [ah] times you lane
time <malay>semua orang tak ada kerja lain</malay>
ya so he was on my list like [eh] local (uh) local account [lah] like [eh] this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the <malay>dia punya</malay> videos was all quite <malay>macam</malay> angsty [ah] like
[oh] you see this vulgar #tat# #tut# #tat# semua basically like <malay>macam</malay> all the people like being annoying [lah] time <malay>dia tengah nak</malay> deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of <malay>dia pergi</malay> #tampines# mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and <malay>pasal tu</malay> time [kan] so we cannot go out [kan] and I was like [oh] my god I've never seen #tampines# mall look like that
ya serious <malay>macam</malay> like like some horror story is here
I can't remember april april may ya april may ya
I'm like when did I stop my attachment
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like <malay>malam-malam buta</malay> like nine plus I was like [eh] this guy doing live live what [sia]
because at that point in time I just thought <malay>macam</malay> he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like [oh] !wow! !wow! he cause it
yes <malay>abang</malay> grabfood
and I think the funniest part was that (um) based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind <malay>yang</malay> like cause of like his friends <malay>dulu kat</malay> secondary school <malay>semua</malay> [kan] and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like <malay>apa ni</malay> bro
ya so (uh) people will like are you malay are you malay then he's like what only malay is it do grabfood
I was like boo
ya I know right ya then ya but (uh) turns out he's chinese [lah] so and then I thought he was #ah beng# actually
he actually he has the #beng# vibes but the most <malay>kekek</malay> thing is like the way he talks is very <malay>macam</malay> narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
then it was like !whoa! you all think that my voice very mesmerizing
<malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] like
ya it's quite <malay>bahan</malay> actually
ya
exactly so I think actually by right <malay>dia punya</malay> target audience is
(um) like fellow riders but then like [oh] my god they're all this like
all following you it's so scary you know [oh] my god like there was this kid <malay>dia macam</malay>
I was like I say <malay>asal</malay> this <malay>budak</malay> like freaking thirsty you know
<malay>macam dia kata</malay> come live with me <malay>apa apa apa</malay> then <malay>aku</malay> was like
!eww! then <malay>aku</malay> press <malay>dia punya</malay> profile then I was like [oh] my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya [oh] it was so scary so and then (um) so he me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk [kan] is <malay>macam</malay> corporate <malay>gila</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dekat dia tanya</malay> (um) in which area do you reside I was like reside [eh]
first off <malay>aku dah</malay> block <malay>dia</malay> I was like saying (uh) don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because of a small lampoon like there was this cause they remember me under sixteen year old girl then I'm just like okay you could in some ways typical is like the wild wild wet
ya because (uh) and then <malay>semalam pun</malay> like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like [ah] [eh] awkward
technically [ah] I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation <malay>yang pakai</malay> [kan] but it's still very disturbing [lah] but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like <malay>tak layan</malay> and then he doesn't assume anything [oh] ya then he was like how do I address you [ah] <malay>aku</malay> was like how do I address you <malay>macam</malay> then
the next for me <malay>macam</malay> the automatic response is miss #farizan# <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>macam merepek</malay> [sia]
#zan# [ah] actually <malay>aku</malay> was like !alamak! <malay>aku terlupa nak tukar</malay> my (um) name <malay>pasal</malay> it's still #zan# A <malay>yang ikut</malay> my (um) and <malay>aku</malay> was like
!alamak! too late to change to air [lah] <malay>takpe takpe</malay> [lah] #zan# [lah] <malay>zan jadi</malay> [lah]
yes [oh] my gosh he was like I'm very tired right now but if I'm not wrong you asked me to call you #zan# right and I was just like yes #senpai# noticed me [ah] <malay>terima kasih terima kasih</malay>
[a'ah] I was like <malay>opocot aku jadi</malay> marauder I there's actually like no real function to it [ah] <malay>cuma macam</malay> bragging rights [jer]
[a'ah] so I <malay>macam</malay> [ah] my dreams
#oppa# noticed me grab ge</mandarin> grab
ya I was I was like planning <malay>kalau macam ini hari</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau aku jumpa dia</malay> I will be like grab ge</mandarin>
probably <malay>dia macam siapa</malay> then <malay>aku</malay> was like confirm <malay>tu kena</malay> instant block
you need only direct ya but
[oh] <malay>ni dia</malay> [eh] yikes
#tampines# that's why so <malay>dekat</malay>
ya actually <malay>dekat</malay> and I kind of roughly know <malay>macam tempat dia lepak</malay>

like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs <malay>yang dekat</malay> the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king <malay>dekat</malay> the
so I don't know like actually his account <malay>macam</malay> supposed to be like educational <malay>ke apa</malay> at an entertainment but it's so true I think like now I can identify like know the back models and shit in case like <malay>aku</malay> yikes
I don't know [ah] if I should be like like impressed or disturbed or what
right like all the super wholesome and educational tiktoks that you have been like sharing on your I mean thank you for like getting me into
thank you for getting me into this man
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya
ya and then there's the <malay>mat minah</malay> tiktok
ya
(mm) ya ya ya ya
okay
[ah]
[oh]
is that is that the meaning of pull like can I pull you I don't know because I keep seeing it on my feed then <malay>aku macam</malay> what's this [eh] like
I <malay>macam</malay> pull <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> pull follow <malay>ke apa ke macam</malay> but it's like those thirst trap <malay>punya</malay> videos
[ah] [a'ah] [kan] I <malay>tak faham</malay>
we'll find out ya but (um)
what is it
okay but <malay>macam maksud dia tu apa</malay>
[ah] (uh huh) (uh huh)
[oh] ya my god you never respond to that when you eerie is so true [oh] my god like once you just wanna be
I I was just thinking of the <malay>mat minah</malay> call
[oh] my god you must never respond to that when you hear it
it's like (ugh) I'm one of them
[ah]
your true colours are showing your true colours are showing
(mm) same
right
(mmhmm)
okay
boom
just <malay>macam</malay>
what
#astagfirullah#
ya correct
ya [kan]
that's the teas
yes actually how did how did you get into tiktok
<malay>macam</malay> how did you discover that app do you remember
right right
it's not a part of or to share or if you share like a an instagram post it always comes in and link right (uh) whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on a anti a and anti social media app
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
right
social media right
native post [oh] hashtag today I learn
(mm)
ya ya because <malay>macam</malay> at the start that was what it looked like [kan] it was <malay>macam</malay> in between musically and vine
[kan]
<malay>macam</malay> there's the reputation [kan]
(mm)
technically those people must be underage <malay>juga</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
I don't know how though but
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just <malay>macam</malay> by proximity like you know the few local
(mm)
you're talking about <malay>macam</malay> algorithm <malay>dia</malay>
sometimes you will realise you videos what have I got fifty and just kept yes doesn't vote so once once you realise just that it's video isn't as popular as between other users then it just doesn't show any
[oh]
!wow!
ya
yes
!huh!
[oh]
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post <malay>terus</malay> like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I <malay>macam</malay> okay all right
like then the subsequent <malay>macam</malay> views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>benda-benda bodoh</malay> I don't tag it I just <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know I don't put anything in the caption you know if you find me it is from the song
ever since (um) but ever since (uh) grab ge</mandarin> I privated my tiktok
wait you drunk courtesy and he's already falling
I don't I don't I don't want I don't want weirdos following me
[eh] he's already following me
so now we're friends on tiktok
I do
apparently I'm one of two people who know and I'm just like ya okay
ya so that's the thing right I was like !wow! I didn't know that tiktok <malay>ada</malay> live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched
actually I was like should I watch ethnic live no let me watch guide to grabfood [oh] my god
ya so it's (um) it's really interesting it's like you know how (um) live [eh] no not live [eh] live and live <malay>ada</malay> like the likes [kan] but it's just <malay>macam</malay> free [kan] you press
<malay>jadi boleh</malay> spam <malay>ke apa entah</malay> so <malay>apa ni</malay> like tiktok <malay>ada</malay> like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
so they get I guess the creator gets like part of it but tiktok gets like a slice of how much you send
ya
ya so just like [oh] thanks you know it's like ya
ya ya ya
I don't think it's that much [lah] because like I said <malay>macam dia punya</malay> follower base is more like <malay>budak-budak kecil</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> he will he will say say like [oh] thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like [oh] thanks for the rainbow puke and I <malay>pun macam</malay> he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk <malay>sekarang pun</malay> like <malay>dah lagi mahal</malay> bro
but it tells you [lah] something so I was like okay
so like everyone is always saying stuff like [oh] come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel [lah] [kan] and <malay>aku</malay> was like what is this thing he's talking about
so I went to scroll a few pages of emojis right
!wah! that's like that's fair

towards #jurong# island girl ya ya then you all get to see new kind of contact you know
and I was like that's fair that's fair

is like I signed up [kan] time (uh) it was like there's no physical lindy class
and then like I think I finished my virtual <malay>punya</malay> class and <malay>macam</malay> they just started opening that time face to #babad# like
cause I cause I saw the thing is I saw #insyirah# (uh) dance is it first like pre
then I was like my god because (uh) I was I was into the music
like middle of last year or something so I always like holy shit like how I know I I I (uh) I recognize the dance moves [kan] then I was like !hey! #insyirah# like is this afrobeat standard like ya <malay>macam</malay> how you know and all that then <malay>aku aku</malay> was telling her [lah] that I listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying [oh] it's that this studio #da# #da# #da# #da# so (uh) it took me like damn long like <malay>aku</malay> just took the information and just like <malay>buat bodoh</malay> [ah] until happened
and then phase two then <malay>aku</malay> was like okay if I were to do a dance class that is not a lindy I'm gonna do this
ya so that's how I started [lah] so the first my first the first class I went was with her and then it was very #suay# because it was like
a super fast one and <malay>aku</malay> was like <malay>aku nak mati</malay> [eh]
ya because unsubsequently it was like slow and chill and guess what today also was fast for me I was just like !wow! do you just not like me
after a long break it's just like <malay>rombak rombak</malay> and I was like [ha]
(um) okay so it depends on the studio but like that studio because of the size they can accommodate (um) three groups of five
like and then like each five <malay>ada</malay> like segment [ah] then you cannot mix
okay like and then like each each five I do like segment are and you cannot mix ya by right [lah] then that one [ah] because you maintain two meters with grammars
ya by right [lah]
then that one (uh) because you maintain two meters <malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask
[kan]
ya my lindy <malay>punya yang</malay> solo <malay>pun begitu</malay> (uh) our capacity is about twelve
so <malay>sama</malay> [lah] two meters and all that <malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask <malay>tapi tu</malay> recently (um) because of (uh) partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then <malay>tu kena pakai</malay> mask [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> like contact
but <malay>itu pun</malay> they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance <malay>sikit</malay> [jer] partner <malay>ada</malay> ya
<malay>dah lama</malay> I <malay>tak joget penat gila</malay> [sia] I was like (ugh)

it's like !wah! I love him <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>dia punya</malay> beat <malay>dia punya</malay> percussion <malay>dia</malay> is like is like
it's not as tacky as like <malay>macam ada</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> [ah] <malay>rentak</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> like #kebak# #kebak# means like cool
and <malay>macam</malay> I feel like <malay>dia orang punya bahasa</malay> is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like (um) the class introduced me to all new like new songs [lah] as in new and <malay>macam</malay> different artists [ah] artists that I don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
I don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists <malay>ke apa</malay> besides beyonce
ya his name is #zul#
ya [oh] my gosh okay so that's the other thing like I feel so <malay>macam</malay> at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
okay
[ah] confirm zumba
like that's the only thing <malay>kita boleh buat</malay> like hello excuse me hello police
[oh] my god
ya so and <malay>macam</malay> the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind <malay>yang</malay> like having fun is more important
<malay>macam</malay> you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but <malay>macam</malay> he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
<malay>macam buang tabiat gitu ada orang cakap</malay>
ya but he very cool [lah] <malay>macam</malay> even the not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no [ah]
no no no actually K K <malay>jap</malay> there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then #zul# is one of the teachers
he teaches afro
then #hakim# also teaches like (um) dance fall but I don't like dance fall dance fall <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>macam</malay> sexy [ah] I <malay>macam</malay> !oof!
I'm not I'm not ready for that
ya I'm not shy
ya then okay it's quite <malay>kekek</malay> like last two days [kan] I went for the same studio I tried (uh) homerun choreo
that one like <malay>aku nak mati</malay> [sia]
the person [kan] like mellow she's a good dancer but <malay>dia punya ajar dia macam</malay> like from the get go is like super detailed
<malay>macam</malay> my brain cannot
<malay>macam badan</malay> angle <malay>tangan</malay> angle
[ah] <malay>kepala</malay> angle I <malay>macam</malay> (ugh)
<malay>goyang</malay>
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I <malay>macam</malay>
ya
ya so I was just like (um)
yes and <malay>loncat-loncat</malay>
so I mean at zero point six it was okay zero point seven still can point eight (mm) I'm starting to fall apart
nine I'm not very sure what's going on I'm definitely at least two counts behind
but it was but the the first then she did the chorus in two days
so the first day (um) afro was like in the corner
then <malay>macam</malay> I felt so demoralized [ah] like it's so <malay>susah</malay> and like
so for me the thing is that like <malay>kalau</malay> stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
and it doesn't bring me like joy you know that's the dissatisfaction
I think cause I'm not like a fan [kan] I just do it cause <malay>macam</malay> it looked interesting
right
so like the first day cause I will maybe I was too focused on like myself but I didn't notice the second day it was fun because I was surrounded by jokers
ya only the person in front of me was dancing correctly behind me she's she's one count behind me
so that says something
and then the ones next to her friends <malay>semua</malay> they were like [eh] today I become chicken [ah] I was like that's not wrong <malay>macam</malay> a lot of them their position I'm just like <malay>kenapa ayam kenapa ayam</malay>
!huh!
ya <malay>macam</malay> cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
homerun
[oh] no sorry sorry the studio beat factory fitness
sorry [ah] <malay>pekak</malay>
(mmhmm) <malay>apa-apa pun pekak</malay>
[eh] <malay>lupa</malay> [ah] K <malay>jap</malay>
[dah] [lah]
okay okay I have I can explain I can explain this is my old one
(um) actually no (uh) this is the one for my games

<malay>dia punya</malay> internal <malay>kalau bukan</malay> sixteen thirty two [eh]
basically it's more [lah] then after that I download a lot of okay I did not download a lot of games I just download maplestory
and then [eh] I try to log in from outram <malay>sampai</malay> past series <malay>belum</malay> log in you
disconnect lag crash <malay>semua</malay> the whole cycle
ya ya ya [a'ah] soon

<malay>apa</malay> [eh] like it's just super laggy [ah] <malay>macam</malay> everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and <malay>macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal</malay> (err) internal memory <malay>dia dah habis</malay> [kan]
so like literally I was running on <malay>entah</malay> something <malay>macam</malay> hundred of free space <malay>ke apa entah</malay>
exactly so that's why <malay>macam dia punya</malay> performance <malay>pun dah macam tahi</malay> [ah]
!huh! but anyway <malay>dah dua dah dua tahun</malay> [ah]
so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for <malay>macam</malay> work <malay>taruh</malay> like (um) prepaid <malay>ke apa kat dalam tu</malay>
ya so then I don't need to like bother using my
!huh! then like bye ya
because actually phone <malay>ni tak rosak</malay> ya it's just and after I bought it over I I can uninstall all the things I'm not using ya so
I uninstall [lah] everything and now it's okay [ah]
(mm) it's okay then now I found a new use for it [lah] because I was thinking [eh] <malay>macam mana kalau</malay> I want to game but I also want to watch his live
I <malay>akan dengar</malay> I just <malay>dengar suara dia</malay> [jer]
ya <malay>dah suara dia sedap</malay>

<malay>suara dia macam macam dia punya</malay> voice quality is very good
like <malay>macam</malay> okay K K (uh) I once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory M <malay>punya</malay> guide
he was like okay hi everybody (um) [ah] [ah] this a guide to ivan okay so the most important is you take the debris okay the debris is very useful [lor] can boost your damage
<malay>macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak</malay> [ah] (hmm)

ya <malay>macam</malay> [oh] and then (um) they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere <malay>macam</malay>
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
because at that time [kan] that (uh) <malay>macam</malay> the way you pilot is still <malay>macam pakai macam</malay> like you driving <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] you <malay>akan pakai</malay> (um) got the <malay>apa macam</malay> clutch <malay>semua</malay> and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart <malay>macam</malay> the later on the #animes# [kan] they they used <malay>macam</malay> (uh) like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much [lah] you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it (uh) I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves <malay>ke apa entah</malay> like okay sure like that's fine
like <malay>macam</malay> if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like [oh] <malay>macam</malay> drop drop from the sky <malay>gitu</malay> like <malay>merepek</malay>
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
(hmm)
ya because it's (mm) it's a bit <malay>dia punya</malay> plot
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
there's then #gundam# got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the #gundam# <malay>sampai</malay> like
and then they continue <malay>macam</malay> star wars <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] so it's like !wah! the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya
ya but that one was okay but it was <malay>macam</malay> [eh] a bit too that one a bit too fantasy [ah]
although it did start [lah] it did spur it it started my my thing for #gundam# so okay fine fine I give you that #bandai#
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay [lah] fun
(hmm)
ya
yes so how did it go
(hmm)
she's like tall she's so tall
(hmm)
right right
ya <malay>betul</malay>
I really hope the posters get restocked though

!oops!
!huh!
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore [oh] okay she knows [eh]
!wow!
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
(mm)
(mm)
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
(mm)
ya ya ya
okay
[oh] ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments [lah]
ya
ya it's always <malay>senang kalau nak cakap</malay>
because you're not in that situation <malay>apa</malay>
ya I see that a lot on twitter also <malay>macam</malay> they will like (err) retweet those those (um) am I am I am I an asshole <malay>punya</malay> post
and then <malay>dia orang</malay> just like throw the whole man away [lah] <malay>apa</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like ya like <malay>macam</malay>
I guess you can write that way but <malay>macam</malay> think about how that person is like going through right
correct ya ya
ya
sassy [ah]
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked (uh) #najhah# about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many [eh]
ya <malay>macam kau</malay> they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something <malay>aku rasa</malay>
maybe at most twenty plus [lah] but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as #naruto# and all that with like five hundred and two seasons [eh] three seasons [eh] in all that kind of
then <malay>macam</malay> !huh! okay <malay>itu</malay> [jer] like ya that's what I was thinking [oh] actually <malay>kalau</malay> I wanted to catch up session quite easy
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is twelve
and like the singapore people don't even the singapore <malay>punya</malay> what or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
ya but that's the thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
I guess ya [lor] like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
but <malay>macam</malay> it's very like we we call it like what #anime# typical [lah] canon typical violence
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know I didn't realise how important do you think so when I watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area
ya
so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>entah</malay> [leh]
but our censorship <malay>selalu macam tu</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
ya
jesse
<malay>kau rembat</malay> [jer]

!alah! <malay>benda tu macam benda biasa</malay> [jer] <malay>bagi dia</malay>
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about <malay>macam</malay> like
and is it okay but I think it's really like <malay>macam</malay> commendable [lah] that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but <malay>macam</malay>
