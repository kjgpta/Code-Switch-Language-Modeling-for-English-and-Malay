yes
(err) I'm fine thank you
ya
(um) I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about (um)
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me (um)
(ugh)
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like (err) couple
so <malay>dia orang</malay> like (um)
<malay>dia orang</malay> want to <malay>dia orang</malay> exit already <malay>tapi dia orang nak masuk balik</malay> so when they want to <malay>masuk balik</malay> and then like the security guard stop them [lah]
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but <malay>dia orang</malay> like (um)
they insisted coming in [lah] and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they block the way and then this security guard was like (um) he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched [lah] <malay>lepas tu dia</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia punya</malay> couple <malay>tak</malay> happy [lah] <malay>habis tu dia orang</malay> (um) so like the security guard
[ah] redirected to me and then like I I I ask [lah] hi sir how may I help you
<malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] like I <malay>nak pergi beli</malay> (uh) I <malay>nak pergi ambil</malay> allen key
[ah] <malay>dia nak pergi ambil</malay> allen key [lah] <malay>daripada dia punya</malay> service counter <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um)
after they take the like they want to take the allen key <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [eh] (err) please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's <malay>dia orang punya pasal</malay> [lah]
(err) when when they left I ask this security guard [lah] like you know (um) like <malay>tak kisah pasal dia orang</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia orang</malay> (um) they they were trying to be difficult [lah] because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so <malay>lepas tu</malay> another security guard <malay>datang lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] (err) this couple [lah] they have a problem [lah] they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark [lah] why why
why (um) why do you (err) (err) how did he touch in the first place <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>dia dah cakap lepas tu</malay> they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer [lah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
(um) and so (err)
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
[eh] <malay>tak boleh cakap nama dia</malay>
<malay>tak boleh cakap nama</malay> store
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
<malay>tapi</malay> like you are not supposed to eat there [lah] because
<malay>takut</malay> you expose yourself to
at your you're risking yourself [lah] to exposure to virus so
ya [lah] <malay>lepas tu dia</malay> argued <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
<malay>lepas tu</malay> we're like no
no eating in the store at all you know
rude [lah] so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like (um) like we don't have a like (um) like we are like lower than them
correct ya so (err)
ya then the day before it was quite funny because (um) there was this (err) couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in !hey! but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then (um) ya so they were they came in and
(err) I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like !hey! why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
<malay>jadi dia cakap</malay> [lor] you know like (um)
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like (err) she was like [oh] like I'm educated you know why you so rude I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
(mmhmm)
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time [ah] they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards (um) crane operators (err) tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down <malay>kat rumah</malay> and then like <malay>melepak tengok</malay> <malay>tengok</malay> youtube <malay>macam</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay> so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
(mm) (mm)
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
(mmhmm)
!wah! that is late
(mm)
my alarm [lah] [oh] my god
you know that's a typical (um) an (err) reaction from old people the audience be like
[oh] like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like <malay>pahala</malay> I'm like sometimes [kan] you <malay>buat kerja bukan pasal pahala</malay> you <malay>nak buat kerja pasal</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> care for the person you know
<malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>tengah</malay> cleaning <malay>buntut lagi</malay>
you <malay>nangis</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>nangis ke tak</malay>
your mum's friend
okay
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>kasih</malay> birth to <malay>anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu</malay> kind of thing
(mm)
(mmhmm)
correct
!wow! <malay>nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa</malay> [tau]
(mm)
!aduh!
(mm) (mm)
that is right
correct
(mm)
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
(mm)
(mm)
you <malay>tahu kenapa tak pasal</malay> I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so <malay>kalau</malay> you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
<malay>tapi</malay> like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things <malay>macam</malay> even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like [oh] I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop [lah] or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like <malay>memang</malay> like I think it's just human nature [lah] like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
#alhamdulillah#
<malay>tu memang dah macam amanah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia sedekah gaji itu</malay> [kan]
(mm) #alhamdulillah# <malay>banyak rezeki</malay>
you <malay>macam</malay> <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) in debts [lah]
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share [lah] we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you [lah] as of now [lah]
ya because like I mean like for
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like <malay>kalau</malay> is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like (um)
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes [lah] like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like (um) I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it [lah] in terms of like
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>bila dia dia dah nak meninggal</malay> [kan] <malay>habis</malay> you <malay>ada kat sana</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at the same time [meh] <malay>pasal dia punya</malay> selfish thoughts <malay>macam begitu</malay> he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like <malay>bila dia dah meninggal</malay> like you have to live your life and his [ah] if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to <malay>jaga dia bila masa</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak belajar</malay>
<malay>lagipun dia ada banyak</malay> family around here daddy is swag
like
correct because I mean I understand [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> family [kan] <malay>tapi tak</malay> close <malay>dengan</malay> family <malay>tu macam</malay> like <malay>saudara saudara tak tak rapat</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> like (um) in terms of helping right ya [lah] like that [lah] but like like you just have to help your family [lah] you know
like my (um) my side of the family is like <malay>kalau ada kerja kahwin</malay> or <malay>kenduri</malay> right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup [lah] blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
<malay>lepas tu</malay> like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point [kan] they will like going to get married soon they'll like [eh] <malay>nanti bila kita kahwin</malay> (uh)
<malay>kau orang suka tolong-tolong</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti kita</malay> (err) <malay>kita kahwin kau orang tolong</malay> [ah] this kind of things it's like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not (um)
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
I don't think that's how you should behave [lah] because then you see the core of your personality you know <malay>lepas tu</malay> like this particular cousins they are like always
[ah] even when there is a wedding they <malay>tak datang</malay> on time <malay>dia orang datang lambat</malay> even the people that they're supposedly close to [ah] like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin <malay>pun datang lambat</malay> so I feel like <malay>ni apa punya</malay> attitude <malay>ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin</malay> and they're going to breed this kind of
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before [lah] like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like [oh] my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and (um)
(um) for me because (um)
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home [lah] which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of (err)
job but (err) my step mum <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak</malay> then I'm like ya <malay>cukup cukup cukup</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> like I told you before right like my father <malay>memang apa macam babi</malay> like you know like he fucking like (um) <malay>tengok</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay> youtube every single day <malay>pukul</malay>

after that <malay>ustazah</malay> he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I <malay>ustazah</malay> say [lah] like like you know like
(err) <malay>perlahan-perlahan</malay> [lah] <malay>baca</malay> [lah] <malay>kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau</malay> (err) <malay>perlu</malay> (err) <malay>ulang</malay> [lah] <malay>lagi tapi</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main</malay> video <malay>saya tak boleh</malay> concentrate <malay>lepas tu ustazah macam</malay> awkward [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay
ya correct (mm) and then like
for me right my my <malay>bapa</malay> is
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
<malay>macam dia</malay>
<malay>macam pemalas</malay> [jer] <malay>gila babi</malay> [tau]
like <malay>satu dia</malay> like <malay>dah lama tak kerja</malay> and he's just (err) waiting for government to give him money
and then like (um) (err) what do you call that like <malay>dia tengok</malay> youtube videos every single day <malay>pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh</malay> on <malay>kuat-kuat</malay> until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
(um) electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months <malay>habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar</malay>
<malay>dia tak nak kerja</malay> then (um) ya then I just keep quiet [lah] like it's your problem [what] I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever [lah] you know
like you you figure your shit out [lah]
my mum know [lah] that he doesn't work [lah]
that's why she divorce him [lah]

(mm)
ya then like #alhamdulillah# like long time [lah] but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family [lah] and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said [eh] (err) I'm going to I'm going to the food court [lah] to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
(err) he got his heartbroken and <malay>dia dia nak</malay> console [lah] <malay>kawan dia</malay> [lah]
<malay>lepas tu kawan dia punya</malay> crush
(err) slept with [eh] will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me [lah] I like <malay>dia tu bukan</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> girlfriend couple <malay>dia punya</malay> crush <malay>sahaja</malay> you you <malay>nak</malay> sad sad <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam</malay>
you <malay>nak</malay> (um) act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
<malay>lepas tu</malay> my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that (uh) [oh] <malay>kawan dia</malay> actually <malay>kaya dia macam</malay> from a well to do family [lah] [lah] [lah] [lah]
do you know what my father say he say (um) [oh] <malay>jadi kalau kalau adik kalau</malay> (um) <malay>pergi keluar dengan dia</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja</malay> coke <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
<malay>lepas tu macam mana</malay> you <malay>tak darah</malay> up [kan] so I <malay>darah</malay> up I <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>kalau nak kalau nak</malay> [ah] <malay>jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap</malay>
(err) <malay>dia cakap dia macam nak</malay> weekend excuse [lah] <malay>macam dia</malay> joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
<malay>lepas tu</malay> what the
ya I mean like fuck man like <malay>dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak</malay> my father [lah] <malay>dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia</malay> [lah] <malay>pemalas</malay>
I mean literally all he does at home is watch videos and (um)
put clothes in the the washing machine and then (err) <malay>gantung</malay> which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like <malay>kerja</malay> (um) <malay>kemas rumah masak lipat baju</malay> #makingkan# <malay>dia kopi</malay>
I mean (mm) <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you old school [kan] you <malay>kerja apa</malay>
<malay>jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi</malay> [tau] and then I even have like I'm working with a guy (um) this <malay>pakcik</malay> he's about seventy plus seventy two
<malay>dia masih kerja</malay> I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty [lah] this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
and like he's working
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to <malay>macam kasih dia duit</malay> you know what you mean <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab</malay> I <malay>tengok dia</malay> unproductive I <malay>rasa macam beban</malay> [tau] like
sometimes I really like
like just (err) pray to god [lah] #alhamdulillah# my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know (err) one funny day (err) my youngest sister told me she's like
[oh] <malay>kakak</malay> you know (err) we were talking about how when you die right and then (um) (um)
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the <malay>bumi</malay> right
my step mum <malay>cakap dia tak nak jumpa</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay>
ya [lah] so in <malay>bumi</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> mark like husband and wife right <malay>tapi</malay> in <malay>syurga</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you you still want to be together or not
[ah] my mum say <malay>tak nak</malay> myself say
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
I can see sometimes he's caring but [ah] as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that <malay>macam</malay> became <malay>geram</malay> became <malay>macam kau dah</malay> [lah] <malay>pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau</malay> also <malay>nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa</malay>
<malay>lagipun</malay> right half of our lives he never raise us and !huh! correct <malay>dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak</malay> expect <malay>kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke</malay> correct
I mean we don't think like that [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum <malay>macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>nanti</malay> (err) <malay>ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit</malay>
ya so for me right usually <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak kasih</malay> I <malay>kasih</malay> my step mum <malay>lebih macam</malay> say
when I was working my full time job [lah] I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so (um) ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
he also likes to count people's money (mm) <malay>macam dia cakap</malay> [oh] like your sister (mm) <malay>dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua</malay> like <malay>berapa ribu</malay> [lah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> he like to compare [oh] <malay>kalau</malay> your sister <malay>kerja dekat</malay> singapore the versus your (err) brother-in-law who's who <malay>kerja dekat</malay> malaysia <malay>dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa</malay>
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that [lah]
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that <malay>sekarang</malay> can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying (err) meaning <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>bila kasih</malay> I <malay>duit macam gitu</malay>
like <malay>itu yang kasih</malay> you <malay>marah</malay> because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
was to like maybe set up a (mm) maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident [lah] but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right <malay>jadi</malay> (um) my step mum <malay>yang yang</malay> he was refusing to give
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
because he like calculative say [oh] you from the <malay>kampung</malay> you indonesian [lah] blah blah blah <malay>balik kau punya kampung</malay> blah blah blah blah blah blah <malay>kalau aku tak kahwin kau</malay>
like you <malay>punya</malay> life <malay>tak</malay> better [lah] blah blah blah blah
<malay>macam gitu sampai sekarang</malay> [tau] <malay>dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran</malay> [kan] I <malay>tak suka</malay>
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him [lah] even though because at one time [lah] they wanted to divorce then we we advise them [lah] like as the older children we advise them to stay together [lah] if they if they can
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you <malay>tak nak</malay> you <malay>nak duit</malay> delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother <malay>pun macam</malay> I <malay>rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay> [tau] like <malay>dia selalu dia cakap</malay> (mm)
why are we born in a poor family
<malay>lepas tu</malay> me and my eldest sister we're like <malay>kau boleh</malay> born <malay>dalam</malay> poor family <malay>tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya</malay> problem
<malay>allah dah kasih kau banyak</malay> avenue <malay>untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak</malay> blame <malay>orang lain</malay>
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those (err) chinese people in society where they say [oh] I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
(um) on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
and like (err) play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged [eh] and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that <malay>jadi</malay> I feel like !wah! <malay>kenapa</malay> [eh] like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
(mm)
ya so ya I mean I'm
<malay>tak tak tak</malay> I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better [lah] or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know man it's like
<malay>tapi</malay> sector <malay>macam mana</malay>
I <malay>tak boleh</malay> I teach drama and english before
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
(mm) which one the the guy [ah]
ya that bastard
