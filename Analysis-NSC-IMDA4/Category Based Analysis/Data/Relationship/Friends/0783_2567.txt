school is fine but it is very boring (um) because
all of the other courses already have their holiday and
and we business school
still have not had our holiday
like
so <malay>macam</malay> very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
Y-
like from other courses [kan]
like jess all you want to meet up but then like our schedule is
very different it's like
if <malay>aku ada pagi punya kelas</malay> then she have <malay>petang punya kelas</malay> then if have if I have <malay>petang punya kelas</malay> then she have <malay>pagi punya kelas</malay> then it's like you really boring
<malay>lepas tu</malay> it's like how to say
it's very dry cause <malay>sekarang tak ada</malay> hands on cause of the COVID so <malay>kita tak ada jadi</malay> hands on activity
then I'm like central <malay>ada macam</malay>
(uh) childcare <malay>kat dalam</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi kita tak dapat pergi</malay> and we suppose to <malay>pergi</malay> so now it's like really dry and like (err) boring and all we do is like <malay>datang</malay> school [lah] <malay>habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita</malay> just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
and then that's all so it's very boring and depressing
but then at the same time <malay>macam</malay> best <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>dapat jumpa kawan</malay> [pe]
<malay>aku suka kawan</malay>
<malay>dapat jumpa kawan habis</malay> like
we go eat together sometimes <malay>tapi macam</malay> sometimes cause <malay>semua tinggal jauh-jauh</malay> so we cannot
go eat together
then when your school start
true
(mm) ya
(mm)
(mm)
my exam start
around the same time as A level
but
because I take four modules two term five modules like including like the sports and wellness but then now like
(uh) in the because we have like college west
east right
and then (err) west and east they don't
do anymore but then college central still do but now because [ah] recently <malay>ada</malay> like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless <malay>macam</malay> is online class <malay>tu pun</malay> online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
<malay>habis lepas tu kita buat</malay> powerpoint slides about the muscles all [lah]
but [ah] then actually <malay>tak</malay> do like any like that is <malay>kalau kita buat macam</malay> project <malay>ni</malay> [kan]
it is counted as <malay>kita punya</malay> participation mark
like because in like
thirty percent of your
thirty percent of your overall behaviour like thirty percent is from your your behaviour
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot [lah] from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now <malay>kita tak boleh buat</malay> so we don't do anymore then we have like
(um)
elementary business analytics and cyber security and and life skill is like type A module so we don't take exam for that we just take like (uh)
tests we take tests we take (uh) we do assignments we do (uh)
like stuck class task group task all and then that is our like final grade [lah] like our participation you know
like tasks and assignments in the class all and then for
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then <malay>macam</malay> quite <malay>senang</malay> [lah] cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you [oh] your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing [kan] <malay>pasal</malay>
each of the people can there's like (uh) over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final <malay>nanti kau</malay> your
<malay>kau dapat</malay> when <malay>nanti kau dapat tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> do like well <malay>ke tak</malay> then after that for my class like [kan] you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good [kan] you have the opportunity to retake your <malay>punya</malay> like test [lah] but then my class <malay>tak ada orang</malay> retake <malay>cikgu cakap</malay> like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we <malay>dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan</malay> but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module <malay>tu macam</malay> cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do [kan] so you learn a lot more to <malay>macam</malay> business more like
(um)
how we are supposed to like treat the customer then how like we supposed to like analyse data then make like
(uh) like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) in <malay>macam</malay> experience through experience cause we do a lot <malay>buat macam</malay> relationship management <malay>lepas tu kita buat</malay> the time <malay>kita buat</malay> like <malay>kita punya</malay> individual presentation [kan] it just
[ah] I talk about like first
[ah] seek first to understand than to be understood is that kind of stuff is like things you learn through life [lah]
then then but we have two other modules which is business rewriting and early childhood [ah] that one is a type B module so we must do assignments like we do everything that we we do the same thing as like what we did in like
(um)
and
what's the thing
and
life skill but then like this one we have exams so we have like chapters to learn and all so our my first exam is like fourteen september and which is exam and then second exam is sixteen september so you only have two exams then after that we can go for our break
somehow we can go for our break then like they will release the result online then you look at your result online [jer] [lah] but then it's very complicated because like
we in right this is the frustrating thing [ah] <malay>cikgu</malay> just go just go through
<malay>cikgu</malay> just go through <malay>mana</malay> part <malay>yang kita nak ada buat</malay> assignment [one] <malay>dia orang tak ajar</malay> like throughout <malay>macam</malay> in secondary school they <malay>ajar</malay> everything [what] even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and <malay>dia orang bagi pun</malay>
(uh) is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like <malay>kenapa budak ini nangis</malay> then <malay>kenapa</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tak</malay> [eh] separate <malay>dengan</malay> parents [jer] then (uh) what kind of symptoms
(uh) what kind of mental disorder what kind of like
(uh) mental (uh) mental disabilities is
a lot to that
so <malay>macam</malay> a bit dry it's very dry
and then
business writing is more to <malay>macam</malay> you write emails letters
(um) minutes of meeting notice of meeting taking like notes when you have meetings is
a lot of writing like one you have
in exam paper you have comprehension
section each comprehension and then you have letter email notice of meeting
and then [ah] like another one is what ya I forgot but there's another component and then you only have one hour thirty minute so you must like
very very fast like really fast
but then like there is a lot of content
then is easier in a way because <malay>ada</malay> multiple choice
so like multiple choice just do it just like pass through that get average thing
lowest mark should be like
twenty
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then <malay>yang</malay> section <malay>yang lain</malay> cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
hard part but then like
we are looking forward like (err) after finishing exam right
we are like like you said [lah] this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april [oh] we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like <malay>macam</malay> how to say
we forget that sometimes it is still we're not ending our first year in december then we are ending our first year like next year april because started in april then now it's just first semester and then sometimes like when we think about it we are like
we have been this school for like so long we have been like in the first semester for so long like we do so much project we did like what five project work and so many
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go <malay>tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab</malay> COVID
<malay>tak yang mana</malay> [eh] <malay>tak boleh keluar sedih</malay> and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
damn tiring
it's very tiring and I do not
really want to like
continue continue like this for a long period of time I just want to like two weeks break and just like go to sleep
like really let's like spend the day like sleeping I didn't even want to go out I want go out but
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh keluar</malay> cause <malay>mana-mana pergi tak ada duit</malay>
so <malay>mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit</malay> [kan]
so it's just but I just want to sleep
and then like <malay>ni</malay> then can think about like other stuff
cause like now even now they are preparing us for like poly life they asking us what poly you want to go and I'm just like [oh] my god we just stay in the first semester why [ah] why you thinking about poly but then like we have to think about poly cause ultimately some of them don't want to continue this course like you can tell
but they want to <malay>tanya</malay> you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
(mm)
(mm)
I think like
I think we're in also same I find it hard working in teams honestly cause like I'm the type that I like to
do like I I I just like to get it over with <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau
<malay>kalau kau buat seorang</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> like I can do <malay>bila-bila aku nak</malay> I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
<malay>macam</malay> I'm a I'm a bad person [lah] I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
(uh)
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like <malay>banyak gila</malay> is the amount of like group projects right is <malay>banyak</malay> is like until like every week you <malay>tukar</malay> group you've just <malay>tukar tukar tukar</malay> constantly you <malay>tukar</malay> cause <malay>cikgu</malay> first of all like
(mm)
the reason they give is because <malay>sebab apa cikgu nak kita</malay> meet
the classmate cause we have a group like forty people
(uh)
quite a large number of people in one class forty forty one
and then secondly is
(uh)
how you
work with people they want <malay>dia orang nak tengok</malay> how
well you work with people and thirdly is like
the different opinions that people have because you are going to be somehow like you my course you are going to
be a teacher you have to work with a lot of different people in the area people cannot speak english people that cannot speak
like
people they want people can only speak chinese then people that can like
speak english or like other <malay>ada apa</malay> language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
how you
<malay>macam mana kau boleh</malay> cope <malay>dengan</malay> working with other people
but then I find it very like
even
<malay>kalau aku</malay> group <malay>yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat</malay> frustrated [tau]
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy <malay>aku macam</malay> noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done <malay>macam</malay> complete [ah] <malay>cepat habis cepat kau pergi</malay> relax <malay>cepat kau pergi</malay> like
one corner <malay>kau</malay> there <malay>duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi</malay> time <malay>kat kelas untuk buat</malay> project <malay>kau</malay> just <malay>duduk</malay> [jer] <malay>apa habis tidur</malay>
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like <malay>semua</malay> my project [kan] is die like <malay>hujung hujung</malay> last minute submit like [eh] but [eh] is good work [lah] we are able to provide good work but it's still
like
it's better if you can finish earlier [kan] in a sense but then
depends <malay>banyak dengan</malay> who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>yang</malay> they are (mm)
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name #ima# cause he just talk malay cause he <malay>macam</malay> he's really a perfect
perfectionist like on
point and he has differing thoughts from mine
like where we stand [lah]
because he is the type of person that think very like
[oh] he doesn't think outside the box often
he thinks like inside a box like shoot my rules person then I'm not that kind that kind of person somehow I'm the type that I like to talk about it then like I think other ways
is that kind of thing
but then like it's very hard because like
honestly <malay>banyak orang cakap</malay> is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
<malay>banyak yang senang</malay> like
<malay>senang</malay> for you to <malay>masuk senang</malay> for you to complete <malay>senang</malay> for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate <malay>macam kau yang</malay> classmate #bo# #chup# like serious like
<malay>tak buat kerja</malay> [kan] I mean <malay>kau</malay> do <malay>kerja yang</malay> you are given <malay>kau boleh dapat</malay> A even though gonna work is like so bad
like because you can't I think you're other classmates don't do it you're gonna get A you want get high marks just because you did it but in my class is very competitive they're not stupid people you know they are really not stupid people like
there are people who score like eighteen
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood <malay>pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar</malay> math <malay>kau ajar</malay> one two three four five under ten <malay>pun sudah</malay> okay [dah] you are set for life in that career in that sense [lah]
then after that
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so <malay>macam</malay>
some people come into our class thinking that come to thinking that okay this is going to be easy right cause gives a lot of the scholarships
scholarships and more [lah] a lot of like opportunities for students
but then <malay>macam</malay> what they never think is that
our class is my class it's very competitive like
really competitive you know like the other type that <malay>macam</malay> every lesson <malay>ada soalan</malay> every lesson <malay>ada soalan</malay> every lesson <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [oh]
they like the <malay>macam</malay>
they really think about their ranking a lot [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I know that some <malay>macam</malay>
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking [lah] but she's clever but #rela# also clever but she also don't think about ranking <malay>macam kita</malay>
sorry to say but <malay>melayu</malay> more relax [lah]
<malay>kita macam</malay> more like okay <malay>tak apa kalau</malay> pass pass <malay>kalau</malay> fail fail <malay>gitu tapi</malay> we try hard
<malay>tapi macam</malay> there are a lot more other races <malay>macam</malay> they are very keen on
<malay>macam</malay> competing <malay>macam</malay> hardcore <malay>gila ni semua</malay> [kan] so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning [ah] but we are learning it break we break up
like a lot of the things we learn like more like less
more slower in a sense <malay>kita boleh</malay> more slow but
even that for even for me that is very hard cause like to adapt
to being in like (uh)
like secondary school
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school <malay>macam aku dah</malay> fail fail fail fail fail <malay>lepas tu bila kat</malay> the end <malay>aku macam</malay> okay pass <malay>macam</malay> I made it <malay>jelita</malay> [bah] cause I I do set expectation that are high
but
at the end I produce like good results but then now like
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up <malay>macam</malay>
I <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
<malay>senang</malay> [jer] <malay>macam gitu</malay> then I'm just like [oh] my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
<malay>aku</malay> go into thinking that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> like <malay>ni</malay> like it will be <malay>nak</malay> very easy
it will be like very like easy right
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid <malay>takkan</malay> tell me <malay>budak tapi tak nak</malay> observe <malay>budak tu lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak tanya</malay> write report <malay>pasal budak tu</malay> then I'm just like [oh] my god I cannot do this
I'm like then my friend is from early childhood poly then she is like
(uh)
but <malay>dia orang ingat</malay> like <malay>macam ni senang</malay> cause <malay>kau jaga budak</malay> [jer] [pe] <malay>kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga</malay> but actually
we watch how the <malay>budak</malay> grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes <malay>cikgu yang</malay> responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then <malay>kita</malay> okay just <malay>besar macam</malay> okay [lah] by this age <malay>dah cakap</malay> actually there's a
guidelines for how certain age you're supposed to like talk by what age you are supposed to talk by what age you need to walk then that kind of stuff but we have to memorize that kind of stuff then we talk about the brain like temporal frontal lobe
the parietal lobe then I'm just like [oh] okay then was like in unit what unit six that we learn about that kind of stuff and then when I look back I'm just like
[oh] my god
[oh] I look back my slides right I'm learning [ah] I'm like <malay>tengah</malay> revise [jer] <malay>aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak</malay> and we revise okay that's actually link <malay>kita belajar pasal</malay> brain then <malay>kita faham</malay> okay which <malay>budak pakai</malay> which part of the brain when they are doing this <malay>budak pakai</malay> then we are just like [oh] my god we are just learning like
same things as like a normal teacher do like all all is linked somehow then it becomes like
when you realise that how hard
that this is gonna be right cause from the
seniors <malay>mereka cakap</malay> from the first year
<malay>kau boleh tahu</malay> how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously <malay>kau dah tahu</malay> like you are like
damn
this is gonna be hard and then [ah] I'm like I'm not even in poly that's the thing
<malay>macam</malay> it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly [eh] <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> they don't know anything about <malay>budak-budak</malay> you don't know anything like
some people even like <malay>masuk</malay> early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how <malay>macam</malay> early childhood has
not a lot of paths for you to go
so end up you <malay>jadi cikgu atau jadi</malay> principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so <malay>macam</malay> that stability is what people want in life [kan]
<malay>dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni</malay> but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
you know that
for the next few years <malay>kau ada</malay> job <malay>untuk dapatkan</malay> they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
or you want to sign contract with and just work for a few months
(uh) for a few years and like
I want to I don't know initially <malay>memang aku nak baca</malay> psychology
cause that's what I want to learn [what] since my points didn't get me to achieve that but then now that I have the opportunity [kan] I just want to go for like child psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide <malay>macam belum</malay> decide <malay>kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam</malay> I'll pass <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
I don't know somehow like girls are better at planning their paths
like I is no shade to guys there's not shade but we think about the future a lot which is like overthinking [lah] we think about the future a lot but like okay is this gonna be like
a smooth journey what am I going to do next like the thing won't even come don't even bother and I'm thinking about uni I know that I want to go to
poly obviously I <malay>aku tak nak</malay> just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
<malay>apa tu</malay>
my friend said that in every like I was <malay>macam</malay> very when <malay>dapat pergi</malay> [kan] you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that <malay>apa tu</malay> once in your lifetime you must experience life
cause it's a very even on twitter you are like [ah] you guys look down on but then like you must experience that cause it's fun it's really like fun it's like secondary school but upgrade
cause now people are more mature so like less drama and just small fun and then you get along with everybody everybody is like
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID so <malay>kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi</malay> we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she <malay>bawa</malay> nintendo switch [jer] <malay>pergi</malay> class [ah] <malay>semua orang main</malay> just dance is like that kind of thing
you know it's very fun but then like obviously now
all of us want to go poly <malay>semua nak pergi</malay> poly <malay>kita punya</malay> ultimate goal is poly
cause first of all we never when teacher first cause when you first enter [kan]
<malay>macam bila kau kat</malay> first day
<malay>dia orang tanya kau</malay> like (um)
what do you want what is your achieve what do you want to achieve
and where is your next step that is what
they asked and like we go around the room
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay #ngee ann# #temasek# #ngee ann# #temasek# that kind of stuff [bah] <malay>banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi</malay> twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
so like we already we all have our own end goal this is where we stop that kind of stuff
<malay>macam susah tapi</malay> that
<malay>bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap</malay> okay <malay>memangnya</malay> it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
when you go uni you fighting with secure spot obviously they are clever people then you fighting if with poly which is clever people you don't know who yet there is no saying that is not clever but we are slower in learning pace
that's obviously true [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>susah</malay> then I see you learn by <malay>laju</malay> so <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
[oh] my god I cannot take this <malay>aku macam dah</malay> stress I remember [ah] me thinking that when I do my assignment like [oh] my god is already so stress <malay>aku dah</malay> stress <malay>gila masa buat</malay> assignment <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> like sometimes <malay>kalau kau</malay> message <malay>aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot do this <malay>aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak</malay> focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
that kind of stuff I think
I I realise at certain point if is this hard
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>itu yang susah</malay> transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in <malay>kat</malay> [ah] secondary school all these are the teacher <malay>untuk</malay> guide <malay>kau</malay> like okay <malay>kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni</malay> okay <malay>kau nak</malay> submit [kan] <malay>ni kau nak</malay> submit [kan] <malay>tu</malay> in <malay>kalau kau tak nak</malay> submit <malay>cikgu macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kenapa kau tak buat</malay> submit
[ah] <malay>kau nak</malay> submit [tau] next time <malay>tapi dia dia orang tak</malay> remind <malay>kau</malay> they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay <malay>ada</malay> exam make sure <malay>belajar tu</malay> [jer] <malay>aku macam</malay> what the hell <malay>aku macam</malay> come on man like
that is the shock and then I think
adaptation is how you are [ah] adapt let me [ah] I think most people <malay>tak nak</malay> it's understandable <malay>kalau kau tak nak</malay>
go to poly after
cause <malay>kalau kau dah</malay> badly adapt poly right <malay>kenapa tu</malay> like you <malay>kau tak macam</malay> you cannot get used to
it's gonna be hard in poly cause poly is more like tough
<malay>macam</malay> I know [ah] focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like <malay>macam cikgu ajar</malay> one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
then we just one person do then everybody speak out like now my group has become like usually we it's a group work but now it's like I do the slide and I just separate the part
<malay>macam</malay>
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language <malay>macam</malay> mother tongue
language I am okay with it but I'm more to english in a sense cause
in early childhood if you get at least a
if you get C five right you have to retake
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important <malay>macam</malay> but then now they are making like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] mother tongue <malay>punya</malay> base preschool <malay>semua</malay> [kan] but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words <malay>macam</malay> there are some things about [ah] what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's <malay>macam kat</malay> movie
like <malay>macam</malay> devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
<malay>punya</malay> like thinking how they make decisions <malay>macam mana</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>budak ni</malay>
like ego is what
like is like <malay>macam</malay> evil not evil [lah]
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then <malay>macam</malay> [ah] when we realised that it's hard <malay>macam susah</malay>
serious <malay>susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung</malay> just <malay>tidur</malay> I cannot take it <malay>aku macam kelas pukul lapan</malay> we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
<malay>kita</malay> back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you <malay>macam</malay> I think the
good thing about I don't want to say good thing about COVID it but the great thing about online learning is you record a lot or your lecture
<malay>macam kau punya</malay> record <malay>senang kau</malay> record like how to say that time <malay>aku</malay> the whole way <malay>aku tidur</malay> like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then but I still there was assignment given at the end of your lesson then I was like
okay now I have to do assignment but I didn't learn anything cause I (uh) sleeping
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so <malay>aku tengok balik</malay> recording okay <malay>macam</malay> okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff <malay>macam</malay> keeping <malay>balik</malay> cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like <malay>kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap</malay> okay fine
it's a good day but then it's like
it's just seriously hard [oh] you know <malay>macam</malay> now is
eighteen it's not such a young age but it's not such a old age either it's in the middle there at least [eh] there are people that want to get married you know marriage is like (ugh)
older and more responsibility in a sense
now like <malay>macam</malay> honestly okay at eighteen right [ah] when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
and then [ah] one of
I have a older friend right #aqilah# [kan] a year older then <malay>dia</malay> she tell me <malay>macam tegur aku</malay> [lah]
at eighteen you find out a lot about yourself
what kind of person you are yourself discovery journey is eighteen what kind of person you are what
what kind of people you want to mix around with <malay>kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan</malay>
who is your real friends who is your friends and who is just your acquaintance these three groups of people
cause <malay>biasalah</malay> cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and then she say then you realise are you a relationship person or are you not
like how are you coping with your relationship it cause like
<malay>macam</malay>
and eighteen [kan] <malay>kau</malay> obviously <malay>kawan kau bukan semua ada</malay> boyfriends [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> [jer] [kan] [oh] <malay>ajak kawan ada</malay> they're going out <malay>dia orang keluar kat</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia orang lepas tu dia orang</malay> go to the beach even <malay>kat</malay> COVID COVID <malay>ni dia orang</malay> text <malay>sahaja</malay> it's just like (ugh) I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kau nak</malay> boyfriend <malay>tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa</malay> are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay [lah] <malay>kau tak ada</malay> boyfriend
that's why I relax <malay>macam</malay> okay now I realise you know <malay>macam</malay> ninety percent of my friends that you <malay>macam</malay>
my close friend [lah] <malay>macam kau aqilah</malay> megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
I would choose studies [lah] if a guy said I want you to stay home when you get wraps up
no I'm not marrying you (uh) I want to like I want to have like education I want to work I want to travel the world
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe #hada# you know she has <malay>macam ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan]
she
don't cause she wants she said after she graduated [ah] she want to take one year break
just
she want to take one year break then I'm like that's a long time bro one year of your life what you gonna do but then I also respect
cause taking a break is something that
takes a lot of decision [tau] cause <malay>kau</malay> one year <malay>kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak</malay> moving along with your life [what] <malay>dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah</malay> getting (uh) upgrading yourself in a way [lah] then <malay>kau nak</malay> you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
<malay>betul tak</malay> unless you have boyfriend [lah] but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
NAFA is poly after she finish NAFA she graduate
she can work she is basically a college
it's different <malay>ke</malay> so it's college [lah] so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan <malay>aqil kita</malay> plan <malay>lagi</malay>
<malay>ke</malay> korea <malay>belajar</malay>
[kan]
you know you can join us you know cause you know what megan me and #aqil# are going there for
(err) early childhood cause their programme that early childhood is very strong and then megan is going there for science like food science I think you can go there then we can all get a
apartment stay together it's gonna be so much fun but #hada# don't want to go
then we're just like come on #hada# then she just said <malay>kita tak nak</malay>
<malay>apa tu kita tak nak</malay>
she she doesn't <malay>kita tak nak</malay> how to say <malay>dia nak</malay> take a break <malay>dia tak nak</malay> continue <malay>belajar</malay> cause I don't think she prioritise
studying a lot
she more prioritise experience and I kind of understand that
(mm)
there's no right or wrong
in a sense there's no right or wrong but it's just that there's people more like
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys <malay>kita macam</malay> okay <malay>kita macam</malay> single <malay>sedih</malay> [kan] cause <malay>sedih tak ada</malay> boyfriend
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>sedih dan lain-lain</malay> but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy [kan] is <malay>bila dia bilang aku</malay> [jer] [tau] <malay>dia tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> into the future
I don't like <malay>aku macam</malay> god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like <malay>dia nak kena</malay> get <malay>dia</malay> life straight I like I find guys like <malay>macam tahu</malay> what they are doing in life right very attractive first
you don't want them who struggle in a sense
ya I feel
(mmhmm) it's like
<malay>susah kalau nak</malay> like okay (mm) we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we <malay>macam</malay> get it [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> we
there's no such thing as no free no care like to me in singapore right your education really somehow determine
who you are in life you know <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay> school decision (um) <malay>aku selalu cakap</malay> [tau] [oh] <malay>tapi</malay> some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are [oh] I'm like
that's that's total like
ya that's total like a lie like we all know it determines who we are as a I'm always like every
year right at the end of every year right
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really <malay>macam</malay> put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
I can understand why they put pressure cause we talk
and then but the but then <malay>macam</malay> to me [kan] the
the <malay>aku punya</malay> pressure towards myself is <malay>lebih besar</malay>
so at the end of day [kan] I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because <malay>macam kau</malay> already
like like
<malay>macam</malay> let's say I <malay>aku ada</malay> a lot of thing spent <malay>untuk diri aku aku ada</malay> like a lot of
plans like of like timeline I have a timeline of my life what I want to accomplish like I don't have my dad already set by twenty five then can bring back home guy
bring back home you don't get married you know bring back home guy so I have like (ugh) and then now what another like
nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
seven years to find my one but then like I don't focus on that
like cause now
I actually single best <malay>gila sebab kau</malay> first of all <malay>aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak</malay>
like <malay>aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang</malay>
<malay>kau tidur kau lambat aku balik ke rumah kau lambat pagi</malay>
<malay>tak ada orang nak bisingkan aku</malay>
yes
the crying no non-stop
that kind of thing
the cry non-stop right then but then
to me I don't know in a sense right
<malay>aku</malay>
how to say <malay>aku tak sangat</malay>
like okay I want
a boyfriend but then
<malay>aku tak nak lelaki yang macam</malay> sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like <malay>macam macam</malay> I have seen a lot of my friends <malay>banyak bagi tahu aku apa</malay> everyday <malay>kau</malay> everyday <malay>jumpa</malay>
<malay>macam kau</malay> okay <malay>kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas</malay> [tau]
<malay>macam</malay> I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like [ah] you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like (ugh) like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
somehow
when I realise can
like how to say [ah]
<malay>bila kau dah seorang</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau ada banyak</malay> freedom you know <malay>kau</malay> you can do a lot of things because now <malay>banyak</malay> of my friends that break up they are like [oh] my god
single is fun but after two months they're like [oh] my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then <malay>aku macam aku tak nak</malay> [kan] <malay>saya lelaki aku macam</malay> [ah] you know <malay>macam</malay> my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if <malay>kalau aku dalam</malay> relationship [kan] I would take it very slow
I'll be like you focus on your life I focus on my life
we'll see where it goes [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
cause obviously <malay>aku nak</malay> date for long term
I mean like
even with my ex I didn't know you know despite all the off and ons right we dated for like what
two years two years and half like that's a long time
like that's a pretty long time [lah] but then like then you realise at the end already right
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>apa yang kau nak</malay> in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like <malay>aku tak ada</malay> boyfriend [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
how I am
most of last most of my last time my friends <malay>ada</malay> contact [kan] can go back with <malay>aku akan</malay> text <malay>macam balik punya</malay> [eh] ya <malay>aku balik macam</malay> but then when [ah] I go back home alone
I feel fine <malay>apa</malay> I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro <malay>tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku</malay> [jer] <malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok</malay> tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff <malay>kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan</malay>
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay <malay>kau nak</malay> you <malay>nak makan tak</malay> the I the best thing is <malay>aku tak payah minta</malay> not <malay>minta macam aku tak payah macam</malay>
like worried <malay>keluar dengan kawan lelaki</malay> boyfriend <malay>aku macam marah</malay> [eh] <malay>kenapa keluar dengan lelaki</malay> like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense <malay>bila kau dah</malay> free for too long
you have a lot of happiness in you
<malay>tunggu macam</malay> how to say [ah]
because my friends say you number one when you break up [eh]
first of all you learn to love yourself back <malay>kenapa macam</malay> cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes <malay>bila dia orang</malay> break up [eh] <malay>dia orang kena</malay> dump they think that <malay>macam</malay> somehow [ah] what's wrong with me <malay>berapa muka soalan kau</malay> [kan] #tang# is like <malay>kenapa aku</malay> then you have to over that
like time where you like okay <malay>aku ni</malay> okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
like that's not good
it's but [ah] then you get get okay can be there then you just like I'm fine I'm the greatest person then you
spend that that days like okay I'm actually that good and you focus on yourself
<malay>kau</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> build up on yourself [lah]
that's what I've been doing for the past like two years I think I beat up a lot of myself I'm like the
like I think this year
changed me a lot
somehow COVID [kan]
I now I know like who I want to be friends with
like during this period of time now I know who I want to be close with like I have you I have like the other girls I have like even #raziq# sometime although he's gone most of the time I try to understand cause you never know what's going in a
person's life like there is a lot of things that
<malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] in a way and then
I would say that the start the twenty twenty the start of twenty twenty january #imelda# is different from
september #imelda# now in the sense cause I'm more like
okay because I feel like I've been like living my life
cause <malay>fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri</malay>
you know that kind of thing
then <malay>bila</malay> now I'm thinking like at the end of the day <malay>kau seorang</malay> [jer] during this pandemic I spend a lot of time [jer] I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
we talk a lot less spend then second most is like with the girls the other girls then third is #raziq#
like I is mostly because I spend a lot of time with family and that's the best thing you know cause they can
like <malay>bila aku dengar</malay> anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> text all the time then <malay>sekarang macam</malay> I like brother and my sister they were sick [ah] what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam</malay> call boyfriend calling <malay>ni kau tu</malay>
family is important to me <malay>macam</malay> I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together [kan] <malay>kita macam</malay> really emphasise my dad my dad really like
appreciates family time a lot like he really loves I think when I was in sec actually [ah] I hangout a lot with my friends like sec four I can talk a lot with them
then I realise like how
how happy I was when I was with them thing <malay>macam</malay>
my family is a type <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau nak faham</malay> like <malay>kawan</malay> friendship <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> is not
anytime <malay>boleh</malay> end
<malay>walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau boleh</malay> end [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> family <malay>kau</malay> will always be there with you and you need to understand because <malay>kau dah besar</malay> you are adult
adult you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku sekarang</malay> I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] she she like how to say
checks up on our like
(uh) she checks up on like our locations
then she check up on our like
(uh)
location [ah] phone <malay>kita</malay> like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
like with with her phone she can switch off our phone like time in time out but then like
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like <malay>kenapa kau nak</malay> lock phone <malay>aku macam</malay> that kind of vibe you know then <malay>bila kita</malay> the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just <malay>macam</malay> how to say
my mum just like [ah] give me touch you <malay>punya</malay> phone
then <malay>kita kena bagi</malay> like my siblings just like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> like they never ask
<malay>aku aku</malay> reply <malay>aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku</malay> phone I <malay>aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak</malay> hide
I have nothing to hide so <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>bagi</malay>
then my brother my brother would ask a lot of question
<malay>kenapa main kenapa</malay> cause he's always playing game
so <malay>dia macam</malay> very agitated [tau] so <malay>macam</malay>
but then we will give and she just download it and she just install it we didn't even know
and then <malay>macam kita dapat balik kita macam</malay> okay and <malay>lepas tu</malay> she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what <malay>tu bukan masa aku muda-muda</malay> [tau] <malay>tu</malay> last year [tau] #sasha# knew about this like <malay>apa tu</malay>
and then after that she always like lock <malay>kita punya</malay> phone <malay>semua</malay> [kan] then <malay>habis tu</malay> when family time she lock off [kan] I was like but we don't ever feel <malay>macam</malay>
I don't ever feel personally I don't feel angry
cause like and <malay>macam kalau</malay> you
that app [kan] <malay>kalau kau pakai</malay> more than eight hours [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> lock <malay>kau punya</malay> phone <malay>tu kau tak boleh buka</malay> so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause <malay>aku sahaja</malay> I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend <malay>tak tau</malay> it charge charge <malay>semua pasal kita</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> bond <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> bond
in a sense [lah]
so <malay>macam aku</malay> I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it <malay>kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila</malay> app <malay>tak ada</malay> [kan] then we understand now <malay>kenapa</malay>
cause
naturally now [kan] <malay>kita</malay> spend a lot of time together a lot <malay>kita tak</malay> on the phone <malay>kita macam</malay> I say to my mum
[ah]
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night <malay>kita</malay> watch the harry potter series as a family <malay>macam</malay>
we just like (uh)
(uh) like at eight after my that eight [eh] like all on my <malay>apa dia</malay> off day <malay>kita</malay> just <malay>duduk habis kita tengok</malay> harry potter like <malay>kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam</malay> it's that kind of vibe you know then <malay>macam</malay> but when I spend a lot of time with cousins [kan] I realise that their families are different
<malay>macam</malay> they don't really <malay>tak kisah sangat pasal</malay> family <malay>dia orang</malay> say
okay <malay>aku dah besar</malay> [pe] okay like now what eighteen
<malay>kenapa nak</malay> spend a lot of time with family
cause
<malay>shazlin dia</malay> family <malay>tak pakai baju raya dia</malay> matching [tau]
<malay>dia beli baju raya sendiri duit dia dia beli</malay>
<malay>dia beli sendiri</malay> so <malay>pakai</malay> different colour [ah] but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink [eh]
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay <malay>satu</malay> colour [jer]
then we buy like same colour and it same with <malay>macam makan</malay> [tau] like it's like <malay>puasa</malay> right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night [ah] last day usually last week [kan] <malay>kita banyak makan</malay> take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then <malay>bila aku macam</malay> spend a lot time <malay>macam</malay>
with other people and <malay>aku</malay> realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
but [ah] same to me [ah]
(mm) cause is I think my family is like that you know then you know the one good thing is we don't hide anything from each other
naturally when I had boyfriend I tell my mum and my dad actually they don't
they <malay>dia orang tak macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang tak macam</malay> forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always <malay>cakap</malay> why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
that kind of stuff cause the guys that I date tie me down
a lot so <malay>macam</malay> my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like <malay>macam</malay> every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this
