[ha] okay K K
ya
ya
I <malay>tak perlu</malay> upload <malay>gambar sendiri</malay>
[oh] okay [lah] and
[oh]
cause other dating apps you need to upload a legit photo of yourself right to make sure that
[ah] I've been wanting to see how it works
[oh] is that
[oh]
[ha]
you cannot like delete the profile [ah]
then what if like the person <malay>dah kahwin</malay> then <malay>lepas tu ada masih orang nak</malay> try hit on the person
<malay>menarik</malay> [oh] god
serious then what did the guy do
[oh] it's like didn't see [lah] cause like your <malay>apa tak nampak apa-apa pun</malay> [kan]
the thing right then they will read it was the limit of ten guys I think [oh]
[oh]
okay okay
ya that's why it's like a bit too intense for me [lah]
Muzmatch
(uh)
(mm)
[oh]
cool through half of our #deen#
ya
ya
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] my god that's nice okay set I will go for half of our #deen# instead of Muzmatch
ya international love that's the way to go
but half of our #deen# also for muslim
[oh]
serious
Muzmatch no need to pay
[oh]
interesting
[eh] then you know the Instagram what's that filter where they have their <malay>halal</malay> meter or <malay>haram</malay> meter thingy
where were where is it from I heard it's from some dating apps also was it I'm not sure
[oh] cause like someone told me one of these dating apps they have this <malay>halal haram</malay> ratio or something
so that they will match you to the right person like
I don't know what is it
do you pray [oh] okay
ya
[oh]
okay okay that's cool
interesting
but do you think you will bond to meet your significant other through a dating apps
I think
[oh]
ya
that's true
I know right
I like to observe the people first from afar
then see how is he like then I did like something that
(um) people other people opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instant if people around him keep saying that [oh] my god he is such a nice person and he does this this this then I will
be like [oh] okay since like he is kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya or else
ya that's true
we have been wanting to do it just for the loves <malay>ke</malay>
to go but then I always feel bad because you like you say <malay>orang kat</malay> Muzmatch <malay>macam dia orang</malay> serious
[oh]
ya
that is so sad
ya
(hmm)
that is sad
[oh] well sometimes it works for people sometimes it does not
ya it does [oh] ya about <malay>apa yang</malay> you said
about putting themselves out there you know some people were saying that in unique
a lot of people also try their best to put themselves out there and you can see there's some people will be turned off by that right
how do you feel about that isn't that like a dating app but then <malay>macam</malay> physical
[kan] [kan] <malay>tak macam kalau dekat</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> physical physically <malay>macam</malay> desperate <malay>tapi kalau dalam</malay> dating app <malay>tak desperate ke</malay>
[ah] that is true that is true
ya
ya ya it does
clap for me
ya ya that is scary
ya
I don't know whether it is still like that is it still like that
or maybe I just turn a blind eye on it it just like
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa-apa apa</malay> [lah] <malay>apa korang</malay> [lah]
[oh] so much [sia] on topic <malay>ini</malay>
but I think someone ask me this before
an outdoor person may I like to do outdoors things like
ya I feel like I told you this before no
I'm a outdoor person like I like to do outdoor things like
then probably an ideal date for me will be doing things somethings outdoor [lah] somethings like trekking [oh] my god I love trekking just like walking around because right
when I trek with my friends I we have we actually don't have a lot of things to do other than walking
and also like since it is quite silent sometimes you want to listen to the silence around you
and if you are trekking with your friends you will be comfortable with the silent so maybe you want to see whether there's ya comfortable with the silent with that guy
and also like (um) sometimes you also want to talk because trekking will be pretty long
so wouldn't want to stay quiet all the time so for instance if I want to go on a movie date
then I can't really talk to him I can't really get to know him right so if I was talk walking I can like
try to get to know him and like see how is he like
[ha]
tricky question don't know [eh] I feel like first date
and like subsequent dates I would want to go trekking
ya not bad not bad is that like too much
I have never dated people before so I wouldn't know what is too much
ya I feel that movie date is too much
because it's so intimate
ya and it's dark and it's scary like
what are you going to do
<malay>kadang orang gatal</malay>
you never know
ya
ya exactly
but that's like another two hours it's too long
I don't know
I don't know how long
ya
do you also want to go trekking
then what is your first date
[oh] ya that's the point though if you can't accept me at my lowest there's no reason being
[oh] okay okay sure
few months okay
[oh] ya then the first [one] [eh]
[oh] my god that's sound fun actually I always wanted to go picnic
with someone like a significant other like I don't know
paint <malay>tengah</malay> picnic [oh] my god that is so cute
[ah]
[kan] like these few days people have been picnicking a lot
ya
ya [oh] my god then like the <malay>apa</malay>
lay flat lay is it ya flat lay
!wah!
that is so cute
ya I would want to end my date with sunset
but then <malay>macam kalau</malay> the date doesn't go well I will be like bye I don't really want to share this sunset with you
so I am going to go home first but mostly that won't happen [lah]
ya
halfway halfway
like
they just went toilet
[oh] that is super rude though
[oh] then I will stand up [lah] try my best to stand up to him then like if <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia tak kisah pun</malay> like he is so obnoxious and so full of himself then I won't even bother [lah] I will just walk away
ya
does that happen often though like you people just ghost
ya
ya
wait <malay>apa tu</malay> catfish
ya I pretty sure it's not
I'm on like a dating app you pretend to be someone else
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
nineteen and this boy <malay>sudah gatal</malay>
ya
[oh]
maybe cause like he's still very young also so like I think eighteen nineteen it's pretty young so he doesn't really know what to do maybe I forgive him for doing that
because
ya like the first thing you already lie like you haven't even start anything you already lie that is so sad
I think I do <malay>cerita pasal</malay> dating apps or dating
wait <malay>cerita</malay> netflix [oh]
[oh] okay
(uh huh)
ya
[oh] okay that's so fast but that's so cute too [lah]
interesting
dating dating <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>gatal</malay>
[oh]
ya it sounds like an interesting concept
[oh]
ya
and everything because you only need the birth cert so at that point it was really a matter of
[ah]
[oh]
that's good I don't know
I don't know would you
no I don't think so
ya ya
it is important
[oh] [kan] <malay>apa ada</malay> some <malay>cerita-cerita cinta pasal</malay>
I don't know [lah] you know the malay store malaysian drama or malaysian movies
where the parents just like <malay>apa</malay> pair them pair their children up then like they their children won't know each other and and don't see each other until like the day before the engagement or something
ya isn't that like kind of the same thing also
(mm)
I used to think that I'm okay with my parents match making me but then now
nah I don't think so
[oh] I don't know I change
ya if I don't get married then it's fine [lah]
twenty five is quite early ya cause like in three years
ya [oh] my god
twenty five sounds like a good age
then now you're twenty two you haven't really get your shit together then like
three years to get your shit that's really too fast
ya I think like twenty five sounds okay if you already have a
ya
[a'ah] [a'ah] my friends also
<malay>macam dia orang beli</malay> under the fiancee skim thing <malay>cepat</malay> [kan] then when I see it I was like [ah]
at first I was like [ah] I want to move out I want to buy a house
at first I was like [ah] but I I want to move out I want to buy a house but I can't really apply for right you know
ya
is it cause of the current resource
<malay>tak cukup rumah</malay>
maybe they should like create an environment that is healthy for the future generation to live in then maybe we will consider to procreate
I mean if like the view if we can see the future being so messed up and everything right now are so messed up and like the systems [a'ah] and all that
if you want to have children would you want our future generation to suffer
ya and that's the thing
nah [ah] just say they <malay>macam</malay> I wouldn't want I know that through all these <malay>apa</malay>
obstacles challenges you will go stronger [lah] and all those bullshits I was like that is such a sad life
[kan]
I mean like in other countries you will still be a minority too
multiculturalism whatever it is
I don't even know what that is
(uh huh)
ya but she's like [oh] okay
<malay>bodoh apa-apa apa-apa sebab</malay> [oh] multiculturalism at its best
ya ya ya
you just one way
ya have you watched enola
neither have I I thought my sister and my parents watch it last night
then I saw one (uh) caption (uh) <malay>bukan</malay> caption [ah] <malay>macam</malay> post
<malay>dia cakap pasal</malay> the politics then I think it was about this
girl this lady asking sherlock I think asking sherlock
do you saw it then I was like [oh] my god ya
ya ya ya
fits you perfectly
I was like bro damn that is like I don't need
(uh) like it's so sad <malay>macam</malay> because of all this kind of things it's just some disagreements
(mm) okay ya
ya
ya that's true that's true
(uh) <malay>kadang dia orang tak sedar diri</malay> [tau]
<malay>macam sedih</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what can you do also
nah nah
<malay>tak kadang dia orang akan</malay> suddenly <malay>berbual pasal</malay> the privilege that we have for example the Mendaki thing and the education stuff
then like (mm) okay
(mm) <malay>kenapa orang</malay> chinese <malay>tak percaya</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
that's weird
it's so jarring to us maybe but
which suits them perfectly
it's so sad
does he saying that it does not exist [oh] my god
ya
that's quite sad
ya [kan] <malay>orang-orang</malay> chinese <malay>tak faham</malay> [lah]
then <malay>lepas tu dia orang kata apa</malay>
then we should step up more so that there will be more representation
otherwise they wouldn't hear right really [meh]
even if I step up will they hear
do they want to listen in the first place
where is the empathy right
people's action
!hais!
<malay>hidup dalam</malay> <malay>susah hati ini dalam negara ini</malay>
ya like other countries aren't any better either
right right that's the thing right
ya that's the thing like everybody keep telling me like <malay>apa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kita orang sepatutnya macam bersyukur</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kita orang tinggal dekat</malay> singapore singapore <malay>bagus ada orang jaga ada orang kasi kita orang solat</malay> ya <malay>ke dia orang kasi kita pakai tudung dia orang tak</malay> we don't die just because we are muslims they we don't get shoot just because we are muslims
then like okay fine I am very grateful for that but like
why like why are you comparing our country with other countries who are even not even on par with us like we are
I don't think we should just compare countries across countries like that
ya ya that's the thing
ya
like even if they allow us to wear is like there is still this line
which is sad like sure like he just like I told you to wear [what]
then like you still treat me so differently just because I wear a #hijab#
ya like what you think I don't deserve those rights only some people deserve the rights
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]

(uh) ya ya is like so cute
[ah] <malay>tapi ada satu macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> quite I don't I don't really like it like they have this challenge on their on their house opening I was like
what I forget already there was one challenge
<malay>entah macam ada beberapa</malay> challenge
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> there is one challenge that I like
is was like (um) calling my (um) my girlfriend or wife a third name [lah] I think that's quite cute actually I like that [one] but some other challenge <malay>macam</malay> questionable
but then so cute
ya ya
you know like I at first I don't understand like why would they feel that
way like
if like you're together don't you want to marry each other then ya
that's true
maybe I will know the feeling when I
<malay>tak tak</malay> she doesn't follow me anymore yeah <malay>tak nak kecoh</malay> [sia]
[eh] do you
do you know #adam swandi# #adam swandi#
never mind then he's a local football player
he just got married
and then his <malay>pelamin</malay> is so pretty I love it
<malay>tak dia kat</malay>
<malay>kat luar</malay> some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I #kaypoh# #kaypoh# <malay>tanya dia kat mana</malay>
cause it's really very nice [oh] my god and the function hall right it was so good the venue they have a space for children like I would want that because usually
malay weddings for instance usually most of the malay weddings I've went to
<malay>takde</malay> any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then <malay>orang akan marah</malay> and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
yes if I were to get married I would want to have like a children's corner for these I think it was a brilliant idea to have a children corner
then
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the <malay>pelamin</malay> [ah] you'll see the bride
at the children corner
I'll be there
the groom was like I don't know where's my wife help me
<malay>tu tu tu tu dia tengah main dengan budak-budak</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> dress <malay>dia lagi</malay>
that's quite funny
ya
[oh] my god I was thinking of that <malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>tetapi</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that
(mmhmm) [oh] I would want
that <malay>macam abeh tengok</malay> sunset <malay>kalau</malay> sunset <malay>dia lawa</malay> !oof! <malay>lagi</malay> best then <malay>kita boleh tengok</malay> sunset <malay>sama-sama</malay>
like the whole family <malay>tengok sama-sama</malay>
then <malay>macam</malay> at the same time I'm scared like <malay>hujan tempias</malay> even if there's like shelter ya and confirm <malay>mahal</malay> [seh] ya would you want to spend so much
on the wedding right
[kan]
like I want a small <malay>majlis</malay> [jer]
it is
their family also like to connect each other's families
that's what I told you about like what the heck
it's just it's just funny how this
weddings how this #walimas# work
[a'ah]
<malay>tapi nanti orang sedih nanti macam</malay> <malay>baiklah</malay>
like I really hope if I end up getting married <malay>macam</malay> the
my in-laws would be nice and like not pressured
I know my family won't be nice
[oh] wells
[kan]
okay <malay>baiklah itu sahaja yang kita ada untuk hari ini sesi perbualan</malay>
<malay>dan</malay> #hazimah#
<malay>terima kasih</malay>
