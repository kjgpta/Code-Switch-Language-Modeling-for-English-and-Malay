you know you may not know until you take
risk
but ya [lah] I mean like
evolve after that then probably like be a teacher
yes dreams of course I'm old we're old man we have to need to
what do you expect
I I ran around (err)
(um) the secondary school area here
ya just like
few rounds [lah]
and then I exercise a bit at the fitness corner I mean it's important to keep yourself healthy you know (um) okay badminton once in a while
you know
nowadays
food
a lot of
process food
and then like you won't get to like
burn the
chemical a lot [lah] then end up getting cancer and all that
this important [lah]
what was this though the badminton
[ah]
ya
!whoa! I didn't know that
!wow! what
how is that possible
!wow!
!wow!
okay [lah] I mean it's not that tiring
if you know how to might manage your time <malay>macam</malay> okay one day badminton then one day
<malay>gini</malay> but evolve is just
something I wanna do
two to three years down the road
then I can take like
until like
from there or something
ya
ya it's important it's important to have smart goals you know
what do you mean
I usually run (um) <malay>macam</malay> about
five to four days a week [ah]
so
kind of everyday but just like weekends <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> rest <malay>penat sangat</malay> [kan]
and I'm so taking my part time degree so
quite tiring
so whenever I've
when school starts then whenever I've
free time then I try my best to run [lah]
and
(uh) and
you know my job
like
they
under
they will
I mean this field is quite underpaid [lah] so I'm trying to find jobs that I can you know
like
secure myself financially
(um)
maybe
two K two K plus <malay>pun jadi</malay> [seh]
yours also I heard it's not two K right
(mmhmm)
the internet also they want experience as I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find a starting job to get all these experiences in a good company
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know <malay>dekat</malay> (um)
I mean it's it's common [lah]
but
everywhere now you go like you need experience and this you know
for people like us
<malay>kasi</malay> [lah] you know chance <malay>sikit</malay> [kan] <malay>tutup mata satu</malay> [kan] and just [orh] come
without any experiences in training will be provided [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> [pe] and
training <malay>apa</malay> internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much [ah] honestly
but I hope I hope you do find you know job that you can be you know
stable financially you know support your parents you know that
honestly
super hard you like
about hundred percent ten per cent [jer] companies who does that
like they
they don't appreciate you they
once you do something bad
it tarnishes your whole reputation
everything your hard work all gone
[kan] <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> company <malay>yang</malay> you know really
focuses on your
[ah] employees welfare
you know and job progression is super important
job progression
yes sure
!wow!
that's unfair
how old is she
she's two years younger and she's the head of your
team
!wah! that's a bit unfair
[orh] it's this happens a lot you know politics in the company and
I mean there are no
chances that
the moment you change companies I mean change jobs
it's gonna be perfect you still gonna face this kind of
issues you know work life issues and
I don't know [lah] this life that's
that sucks but
it's important nowadays that
company
you know take into account
I mean that's why
(um)
exist
ya so and anything complain [jer]
ya with no power to change
nothing no control over
you know this kind of things
you know
I am a student care teacher
(err) basically I just supervise the kids [lah]
(um) you know
make sure ensure
their safety is well taken care of hygiene
and you know we're
make sure they stick to their routine
like <malay>baca buku</malay> about homework
and then mark their assessment books
but the funny thing is
my boss said that
(um)
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
so like you're contradicting yourself <malay>macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni</malay>
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline <malay>macam tak kisah dorang buat apa</malay> but then
a moment later you're there changing the
there was [oh] <malay>kena buat</malay> assessments [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah]
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused <malay>yang budak-budak ni kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>dah balik sekolah penat</malay>
<malay>satu hari dah belajar abeh balik</malay>
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
talk at all you <malay>masuk bilik</malay>
start <malay>belajar</malay>
homework
and <malay>tak boleh baca buku</malay>
<malay>sampai habis</malay> assessment book
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
for their well-being <malay>macam</malay> okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them <malay>macam</malay> shelter but
okay [lah] <malay>kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu</malay>
<malay>masuk belajar</malay>
<malay>nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh</malay> [tau]
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
<malay>kalau</malay> rest <malay>pun</malay> ten minute
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high [ah] maybe because of that you know kids complain <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>penat</malay> you know I don't want to go student care anymore
torturing so
a lot of people
quitting [lah] actually like one month <malay>macam</malay> about seven
a lot
that's the thing
ya and I can't even laugh with them
I can't even
talk to them
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit <malay>macam</malay> you know sit like
like
they fold their legs fold <malay>pun tak boleh</malay>
yes they have to sit <malay>macam</malay> you know upright sit properly
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
I mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you I mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
you know our own choices <malay>macam budak-budak ni</malay> like <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>semua benda kena</malay>
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do I do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay [lah] I mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
I wanna know
it's okay just tell me
[oh] ya I did [oh] my god I miss her so much (um)
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and [ah] I met man the house so so empty
and
so <malay>dapat dapat jumpa dia sekejap dapat dapat ubat rindu you know</malay> you know

nowadays (um)
you know when you find a soulmate you know you just

<malay>dapat</malay> and okay <malay>kahwin</malay> and like
<malay>dan</malay> you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
<malay>jodoh semua ni susah</malay> [lah] I mean like but
it's important to go with the flow you know

for years right

I mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay [lah] take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
[oh] I love that
I need to write that's
a perfect quote
(um) me and my family okay
I don't know [eh] I mean like I'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have [eh] have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
I I think I have to be the bigger person right now but I'm still coping cause I don't know how
I don't know I'm really I'm lost
but
okay [lah] slowly slowly maybe I get to learn stuff
but I'm still at a stage whereby
I focus on myself a lot
and I'm scared that
you know I might
I might
lose
the responsibility
<malay>macam</malay> like I don't know I I will learn from it [lah]
I mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
[oh] man
I saw this post and they said that (um)
the first child
<malay>macam</malay> they will get like a set of rules
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
(um) ya pass off so
<malay>macam</malay> it's kind of unfair
but at the same time you you are nurtured
(um)
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third [lah]
so that's why like I'm lost right now but then you are the eldest we're like okay okay I get this right I get that right
so ya [lah] are the pros and cons
but
I I hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because I look up to you also
cringe
(mm)
that's true
that's true
and no wonder I'm friends with you
(um) okay talking about sweet right
I scared [leh] I scared of diabetes
<malay>macam takut</malay> [tau] okay you know like they say <malay>macam</malay> when you
(um)
when you buy <malay>buang air kecil</malay> [kan] then like there's ends
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
how to say <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada kencing manis gitu</malay>
in my family <malay>punya</malay> history
<malay>ada</malay> okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
my grandpa <malay>macam semua ada</malay> this history of
diabetic
don't you <malay>takut</malay> [seh] say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
his deserts you
<malay>takut</malay> [lah] I mean like I have to take care of my diet [lah]
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
[oh] my
I'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high [lah]
but
okay the thing I am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
so I am like [oh] okay <malay>jap</malay> white bread is high
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then I I went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower so that you
okay <malay>macam</malay>
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
insulin <malay>tak pakai banyak</malay> even insulin is working perfectly
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
(mm)
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
that's the thing <malay>kuah lemak apa</malay> [ah] cholesterol [oh] my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
I mean I don't mind eating salad
but
the options
<malay>dekat kedai ada ke jual</malay> salad like hawker centre
I mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce <malay>kita beli</malay> like ten dollar but then
<malay>pakai tu</malay>
you save so much
that's true <malay>beli</malay> like <malay>banyak</malay> then after that <malay>simpan</malay> in the fridge
<malay>abeh busuk</malay>
one to two days
!wah! this is
this is the thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
is quite hard
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition <malay>nak</malay> physically active [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> busy [lah] <malay>dengan kerja</malay>
ya that's true
I mean I've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know like
nutritionist exist to <malay>macam</malay> lead them
<malay>itu semua pakai duit</malay> [seh] do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
like why can't you just love is free yes

(err) love <malay>pun susah dapat</malay> like
I think like we're at that age
where everything is just hard

twenty two curse
that's true and parents nowadays also working <malay>abeh balik dah tidur</malay> you know that kind of thing
and ya [lah] it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend <malay>gi mana</malay>
we <malay>lepak dengan kawan</malay> but I mean it's not wrong but okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> balance [lah] okay one day with your parents one day [oh] I've heard of this story before <malay>satu</malay> okay there's this one (um) student right
<malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) <malay>makcik tinggalkan</malay>
her
grandfather
[ah] abandoned him <malay>dekat</malay> bus stop <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia

singapore
[ah] <malay>dia tinggalkan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia letak</malay> bag <malay>suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa</malay> [ah]
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then (um) they receive a phone call from the dad (um) the dad call another [lah] his son [lah] another son
<malay>cakap</malay> (um) <malay>bapa nak balik</malay> you know that kind of thing and the son also <malay>tak cari bapa dia</malay> for one month
then went there
and <malay>nampak bapa dia dekat</malay> old folks home
and he said the father said okay me home [lah] then then they say like [oh] it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay I can live in your store room also
the father pass away
ya that's true <malay>macam</malay> you know
maybe the financially <malay>dorang tak boleh</malay> handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays <malay>banyak macam</malay> drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ni ya allah tak baik</malay> [seh]
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
the kids now the kids <malay>ada sekarang</malay> trauma issues
you know
that's true that's true
I mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why I'm scared I really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
ya [lah] they've taken care of me well <malay>apa kecil-kecil kasi makan</malay> this a way for us to repay back
that's true <malay>macam</malay> it it
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good [leh]
because
(um) doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia <malay>punya</malay> chances
of (um)
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so [ah]
how old is she now
but the around
(oo)
I think more the the the the over sixty five [lah]
definition of
(um) <malay>lepak</malay> or relaxing at her old age
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe I I mean like if I'm her also I will

(oo) that I like the question (mm)
(um) I
think [kan] I would
probably would love
love
to
just
(um)
around
okay [ah]
paris area
london because
I don't know <malay>macam</malay> singapore
is it so rushing
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only <malay>ni semua nak merebut</malay> [lah] but then
I have heard a lot of people saying that
you know if you really want to chill chill mango <malay>pergi dekat</malay> paris
just <malay>duduk minum kopi</malay> and you
the rest of them are chilling as well
I want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know (um)
ya [lah] but that's my goal [lah]
just
ya you how about you
<malay>cantiknya</malay>
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax I don't know
I feel like singapore just need to chill a bit [lah]
it's just too fast pace but
<malay>ada</malay> pros and cons <malay>juga</malay> fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent <malay>macam</malay> economy !wah! <malay>jangan cakap</malay> [ah]
but
ya [lah]
<malay>lepak sikit</malay> [lah]
and like
you know the population <malay>pun sekarang</malay> <malay>macam</malay> a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
people like us
so I feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control [kan]
I mean it's not weird I mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me I wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
<malay>pun</malay>
I mean <malay>rezeki tu</malay> okay [lah] there's <malay>rezeki tu datang dari</malay> very you know
god but like
I don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
<malay>makan pun berapa dah berapa</malay> dollar okay <malay>nak beli</malay> pampers <malay>nak beli ini</malay> and
five times five
if I have a high paying job I don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle I can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
(mm)
we're like that okay
but
I feel like ya I mean like if you have
something to work towards to
I mean you get motivated [what]
in certain way
but
to me <malay>macam</malay> house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid [lah] I've never been living with a maid before <malay>macam sedap</malay> [kan] <malay>ada orang kemaskan</malay> you and all that
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future I mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
I mean that's good [lah]
planning is
everything
honestly I mean like
you don't just
go <malay>macam</malay> okay (err) go with the flow <malay>macam</malay> go with the flow <malay>sangat</malay> you know
like
[eh] okay
but like
ya [lah]
I mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
[oh] I took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation I took a one year gap
ya we did we both did I remember
it's like
okay to me <malay>macam</malay> one year gap is quite productive [leh] like you just take one year to just
think about what you want
actually that's true I mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so (um) and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
momentum <malay>dah hilang</malay> [tau] <malay>hilang</malay> graduate
<malay>abeh dah tak belajar</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> #shiok# <malay>dah naik</malay> #shiok#
so <malay>macam</malay> if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
meant to be
that's why I believe [lah] so that
I mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
[oh] man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know I took a one year
gap come on
no I
after I graduated
I work okay
may I I graduated <malay>kirakan macam</malay> april [lah] [eh] <malay>dah habiskan</malay>
then I
kept up
till november <malay>terus</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay>
do they work part time also
I didn't know that
I didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing I know you were good at savings I know you had like
!wah! a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
[oh] my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason I mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
I feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know I mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
I mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and I heard that is a good school
so better [lah] aim for it and there's a lot of my friends <malay>yang</malay>
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so I feel like you have higher chances of
getting
the <malay>punya</malay>
intake
but #inshallah#
I mean like you can I can [lah] I have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
I mean uni hard is going to be hard I mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya [lah] you can manage your time well
so
I feel like you can [lah]
and is good because you are taking full time right
answer me

I mean you just mainly just look at your major [what] minor you can choose later cause major okay what marketing is it what
what which part
so minor I mean you can minor in <malay>apa</malay> organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
ya
I think minor minor in business or what
minor is just
literally the word minor is minor
the major one is a major
you get what I mean
ya so
but marketing is
on demand nowadays
right
[oh] <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
and
healthcare also
I mean like you can market
but under healthcare [what]
why not
[oh] ya I forgot
doctor times
okay
ya but I have heard about it
[eh] I'm but I'm planning to
I'm planning to
going under healthcare also
like under social work
now after this feel cause I'm tired of teaching
just tired of
watching kids suffering
so maybe I will get back to it later
you know you know I'll just explore and
this is the thing I heard you know I don't like when people generalise
us
as job hoppers
ya I mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
I mean depends [ah] on the situation <malay>kalau nak</malay> job hop just because [oh] you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not <malay>macam</malay> you're still young you need to know what you really want in life <malay>kalau tak</malay> experience <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh]
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
I'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
progress <malay>betul-betul macam</malay> you know be successful
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
[oh] my god that is ridiculous okay <malay>merepek gila</malay>
but
okay [lah] I mean there are so many expectations of us
<malay>macam</malay> we are barely okay
I'm not
try to
I mean there is
people our age
like with so many <malay>macam</malay> experience and really capable
but
<malay>takkan nak sama</malay> okay over generous everyone as the same
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
I mean don't
don't over expect too much and also don't <malay>macam</malay>
you know like <malay>letak kita kat bawah sangat</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang macam</malay> [eh] <malay>korang ni tak ada apa-apa</malay> [ah] just nothing you know
middle [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
borderline you know that kind of thing
so I really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about [lah]
that's true <malay>macam</malay> like
I always watch like movies you know <malay>macam</malay>
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
and <malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat</malay>
in singapore
because all those movies are
always based on other other countries you know
<malay>macam</malay> america <malay>ni semua</malay>
I don't know like
okay like
sometimes I do have thoughts <malay>macam</malay> if we want to be like
overseas you know working overseas will we be success more successful like [oh]
you know as compared to in singapore
you get what I mean
[ah] okay okay this now is a fun topic okay I don't know where but I like [ah] rom com
you know romantic comedy
those kind and I like thrills also thrills movies
ya so anything that keeps my adrenaline you know rush because I'm an adrenaline junkie
how are you

[oh] I mean I I've seen
everyone like posting about stranger things
<malay>apa ni</malay> is stranger things
but like okay [lah] I I might watch it one day but you should watch modern family
it's hilarious
hilarious
okay but if you watch modern family with someone
it's funnier
then watching alone probably like (uh)
okay [lah] funny but [eh] quite boring
not boring
but like it's
nicer with someone
exactly and I'm single as hell
[oh] that's so sweet
<malay>ada</malay>
I mean I wanna watch but I don't wanna get stuck
on on it you know
like people play like among us
but like I don't
I really want to try but I don't want to get stuck on it
is it a hype or is it just for a while
I see okay
that make sense
but I can see you is the type of person who can control you know you have
quite
a decent self control <malay>punya</malay> tolerance but me
I can't like I don't have self control
like once I'm indulge into that [kan] <malay>habis</malay>
it's over for me so I tend I tend to <malay>macam</malay> you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like #muay thai# gym
know things that
you know are healthy
and
ya I don't mind spending
over
time on it
alright [oh] my god it sounds like a plan
okay
it's been long since I start playing you know
games
and ya [lah] I mean like
we are twenty two what do you
expect
we rarely [oh] my god did you overcook
it's because it's so hard
is it okay which one the the older one or
[eh] the younger one
[eh] wait wait wait wait
the
the youngest
[oh] are you serious
you don't play with the second one
I see boring
but
ya [lah] I
I mean I love four
for I usually waste money on play nation <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> waste of money [lah] so I stop playing games
but overcook is fun
switch is simple <malay>kau macam</malay> you can bring it around <malay>pastu boleh main</malay>
that's true that's true
I mean but
ya [lah] I mean
I'm trying my best to not spend
not spend on stuff that are unnecessary I mean like
there's a lot of things I wanna do I wanna shop you know I wanna shop for facial stuff makeup
<malay>baju ni semua</malay> but I'm trying my best not to
because
I feel like overspending I won't be able to save
in the future
do you invest in anything
I see [eh] wait where does he where <malay>macam mana dia</malay> invest
on so every month
I see but how much does he save per month
<malay>tak sikit</malay> [kan] that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just <malay>kasi macam</malay> hundred seventy <malay>gitu</malay>
and for fifteen years [ah] then <malay>macam ada</malay> you will get back like a lump sum
(um) and in case if you were to <malay>macam</malay> touch wood [lah] <malay>macam</malay> pass away or anything like
you will get
more
than what you save
<malay>macam</malay>
hundred K
how to get [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
I mean it's quite
reassuring [lah] to know that
you know these thing which are the backup plan <malay>gitu</malay>
ya so I feel like you should you should invest on
I mean I can I can like brief you through it [lah]
like
all these investment and all that kind of stuff
it's really productive okay
we should
