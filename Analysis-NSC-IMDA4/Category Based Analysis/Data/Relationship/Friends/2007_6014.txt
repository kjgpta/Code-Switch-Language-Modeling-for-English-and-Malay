alright
ya so the correct so the third year <malay>aku</malay> move out (err) then I was (uh) staying <malay>dekat</malay> my aunty's <malay>punya</malay> place [lah] so what happens is (uh) I was there (uh) for actually <malay>aku duduk kat rumah dia</malay> [kan] for very long it's about
(uh) overstay my welcome is because I think it's too too long [lah] it should be
(uh) I they gave me hints [lah] ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed <malay>dekat dia orang punya</malay> place for one and a half years ya one and a half years (err) my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way (err) they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then (uh) that was the the time where <malay>aku</malay> just (uh) you know just tried to just tried to to survive [lah] you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof [lah] and then I was you know so that was a good thing [lah]
correct so that was that was (err) (err) you know (err) at the end of the three years then (err) <malay>aku</malay> early this this this year [ah] first of january actually
(err) sometimes okay terms sometimes <malay>tak</malay> okay [lah] so that means <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> she will invite me back [tau] <malay>macam</malay> (um) you know to to her to the family home [lah] but (uh) sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
yes and then after that I I you know many many a time I told her that okay I'm never coming back but in the end I still come back you know that kind of thing [lah] you yes (err) so the the the the very interesting thing that I realise that when I came back
(um) she totally changed <malay>bukan</malay> change <malay>macam apa</malay> [ah] so she totally <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you know she she's more (err) she she literally like (uh) tries to bother about what I'm doing you know (uh) getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>aku rasa</malay> she I don't know whether she realise [lah] that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing [lah] so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me [lah] now (err) but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months [eh] we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept

I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time [ah] whenever it I'm the same as you [ah] <malay>mesti kalau macam cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti nak menang</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> in an argument [eh] <malay>kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang</malay> so I'm always <malay>macam</malay> energetically fight back [tau] [ah] passionate <malay>macam</malay> fight back [tau] but nowadays [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I I don't know [ah] <malay>kenapa</malay> it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through (uh) certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so (uh) <malay>kita macam tak tak</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's no more energy to to [ah] to to expand to to argue [tau] <malay>macam</malay> at the most <malay>pun kalau</malay> even if we don't agree [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer [lah] you know it's just you know you just you just stop [lah] just you just don't don't don't speak [lah] but but it's something that I have always (um) like <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really thankful that (um) she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because (err) I I knew back then [eh] I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay [lah] you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because (err) <malay>dia pergi haji</malay> (uh) last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that (uh) she came back and (err) I think I don't know [lah] maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
and then after when she came back ya when she came back (err) she was more (err) you know (err) she was more more able to control herself [lah] her emotions [lah] and on my part also I try to I try to control my own emotions [lah]
ya
yes it's not a one size fits all kind of thing yes correct

so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this <malay>dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap</malay> I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience [lah] ya and then <malay>apa</malay>

yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya

yup yup yup
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>yang yang yang ni apa</malay> we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was (uh) the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time [kan] so you ask me to apply for <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) opening [kan] <malay>yang yang</malay> ala air steward
ya (err) I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about (uh) I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like [eh] come [lah] just just follow me [lah] you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at <malay>dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>kat</malay> #yishun#
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area <malay>dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>dekat</malay> McDonald's and then <malay>kat luar</malay> and then we were talking about things like illuminati [lah] we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right (um) the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective [tau] which which means okay <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example [eh] I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand [tau] <malay>kenapa dia macam gitu</malay>
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective (uh) a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think (uh) it's quite it's it's something that (uh) there I I would I would (um) and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn [lah]
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so (err) and and and it was honestly right my mind [ah] is always a one track thing so let's say for example [kan] <malay>aku cakap</malay> okay I told myself [ah] I I want to become a pilot but (err) I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing [lah] so I I don't have that kind of (err) presence of mind [ah] to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
for me
[oh] right
so so my my life in in this industry [lah] in this aviation industry started out with (um) with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room (uh) on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion [lah] because he wanted to become a pilot himself <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> eyesight (err) <malay>macam tak</malay> (err) how to say [eh] (uh) not hundred percent [lah] not not not not a six six [lah] vision [lah] so (uh) and at that time [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> very strict [kan] <malay>kalau kau punya</malay> eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance <malay>dia lain</malay> [ah] [ah] [tau] yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right <malay>sebab tu</malay> [eh] they realise [eh] in (err) in (err) eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so <malay>dia orang</malay> (uh) they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot [tau] who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because <malay>dah tak boleh apa</malay> because you <malay>dah pakai</malay> you <malay>dah pakai</malay> glasses then that's that's it [lah] you you no more already [lah] no more chance right so [ah] so that was what spurt on my motivation (uh) and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in (uh) so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to (err) (err) start the flying course [ah] so that time (uh) they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents (uh) fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight <malay>macam</malay> familiarisation flight [ah] so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> then after that <malay>apa tu</malay> they they brief us and then (err) they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that [lah] this was a very long time ago <malay>sekarang dah takde lagi</malay> [tau]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang</malay> is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition (uh) even further because I felt you know [ah] bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight <malay>dekat</malay> youth flying club [tau] and this was when I was sixteen [lah] when I was up there it was such a different feeling
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
[oh] definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet [lah] bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing [lah] that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that [lah] ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could <malay>tapi aku</malay> I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics <malay>macam</malay> science [ah] science <malay>punya</malay> subject [kan] (err) I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
(uh) it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time [ah] I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my (uh) my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so (uh) puzzled because <malay>did cakap apa</malay> [tau]
(uh) [eh] I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics [ah] but your other topics [ah] you <malay>rabak</malay> man you cannot make it why [ah] then I realise that but it was it was (uh) (uh) only way way way later [lah] then I realise that (uh) okay I I I actually
[ah] no no it was a academic (uh) more of a academic kind of (uh) mistake [lah] (uh) I mean it was a academic (um) how to say [ah] misstep which which I could have my my my (um) my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science [ah] which means then after that (err) the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was (uh) just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six [ah] I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit [ah] when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis [ah] so I had to remove my appendix because (err) it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had (err) not (err) what (err) gone to the hospital [lah] (uh) if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally <malay>aku tak boleh bergerak</malay> I was just I I and I still remember that day was my (uh) examination my english paper <malay>punya</malay> examination and (err) I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now [ah] okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication (uh) in which this this (uh) operation actually made my stomach lining weak
(uh) because they have to cut they have to cut through [mah] so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my (err) my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another [lah] basically so it was first it was an appendix then (uh) it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical [eh] in a medical sector your intestines (uh) usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
(uh) apparently that can be fixed okay (err) and and basically what happens is (uh) if you fix it (uh) generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
it recurred again ya it recurred again so (uh) that was another dent in my in my in my dreams [lah] basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know <malay>aku pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>punya</malay> air steward <malay>punya</malay> interview <malay>tu yang aku</malay> pass
(err) actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why <malay>aku tak aku tak dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>jadi</malay> (err) air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up [lah] how it all times ties back together
this this this this (uh) this condition but (um) the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and (uh) hopefully hopefully [lah] [ah] cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again [lah]
!huh! this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was (uh) in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is (err) (err) specifically flying related
so (uh) they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day (uh) but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying [lah]
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation <malay>aku pakai ni aku pakai</malay> my medisave (uh) my my <malay>apa tu orang panggil</malay>
(uh) I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid (uh) <malay>pakai</malay> insurance [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my medical insurance [ah] ya (err) for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
<malay>apa</malay> working
am I still what
in that in that in in in that [ah] [oh] debt (uh) I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
<malay>ada ada sikit sikit</malay>
<malay>ada ada sikit</malay> (uh) my mortgage [kan] every month is (uh) one point one K (uh) <malay>aku punya</malay> (err) they cut off <malay>aku punya</malay> (uh) eight hundred
so <malay>aku kena</malay> top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future [lah] <malay>aku aku aku</malay> I was thinking [lah] anyway that [one] is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me [lah] which is why I wanted a bigger place (uh) the other reason was because <malay>aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang</malay> [ah] all my baggage my
[eh] I don't mind man I really don't mind <malay>kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat</malay> it's just beside admiralty [jer] also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area [kan] and (uh) the it's only about <malay>macam</malay> five minutes
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay> it's not it's (uh) it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential <malay>punya punya</malay> place [ah]
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them (uh) [ah] no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate (uh) site I was actually doing (uh) business business aircraft when I was in the
yes I was there (uh) okay [lah] it was it was (uh) it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is (um) when you are overseas [eh] (err) your how do I put it [eh] you you're considered as an expat [tau] so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration [lah] so that's the reason why (um) most of us [kan] <malay>kita belajar kat sana</malay> we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to (uh) apply with the local <malay>punya</malay> okay so right now right now (err) so okay so so right now what happens is this [eh]
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
so (uh) average [lah] it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level [lah] I'm not I'm not a <malay>macam</malay> senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of (uh) about four K about there [lah] about about (uh) thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes so when COVID happened (err) this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad (err) I mean it was just a very bad timing [ah] it was the worst hit industry ever (uh) unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and (uh) they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old [lah] so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again [ah]
to the parts [ah] they get (uh) they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
(uh) some of them they do but most of them for the most part (err) they don't need right they just they juts leave them there [lah] they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there [ah] nobody wants to (uh) you know [ah] then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this [lah] you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be [lah]
[oh] man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of (uh) of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot [lah] this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was (uh) it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay [lah] so I thought it was (uh) it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did [lah] and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed <malay>kita dah</malay> sign contract <malay>kita dah</malay> sign #dok# we even we even (err) graduated <malay>kita semua dah</malay> celebrate [seh] we went out drinking I mean
[ah] <malay>tak tak tak tak tak</malay> I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks [lah] along the way there's you know there's <malay>ujian</malay> there's setbacks there's (uh)
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
ya I know right <malay>macam nasib kentang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before [lah] this phrase I know I know
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining [lah] you know in in every ya so <malay>aku</malay> I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to (uh) goes back on track and all that right (uh) I I'm pretty sure [lah] one day [lah] one day I (uh) you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it [lah]
but but for now (uh) I got the next best thing which is (uh) flying drones [lah]
[eh] it's a different skill set [lah] [sia] it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself (uh) being on the drone so when I see it I was like [oh] okay ya [lah] but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do (uh) (uh) that's relatable and that's (uh) you know but I think (uh) they they have already announced <malay>macam</malay> plans [lah] you know
(uh) they want to push us to become (uh) flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is (uh) back to normal again right (uh) I think you know hopefully [lah] hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] #dok# flight <malay>tak boleh</malay>
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers [eh]
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen [ah] but if that ever happens [ah] you will know why [ah] you know all about the history behind it [lah] you can tell people [oh] yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya [lah] yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know [oh] my goodness
yes
yes yes yes
effort yes yes
(mm) (mm) ya ya ya ya ya I
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm) okay
