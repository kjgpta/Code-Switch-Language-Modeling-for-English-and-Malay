ya okay
so
(um) not mine hers
it's about a situation
so basically she she is confused if the guy that she's talking to right now is just a friend or someone that she is she is willing to pursue
until they die
okay you talk talk talk to me okay talk to me
so okay so what happened is this fella send him a photo okay so let me just talk to you okay cause I scared they will like not accept us if we talk to them so okay so number one
please accept me
<malay>kejap</malay> okay <malay>tak apa</malay> if he were to send you a gift that is a bloody portrait
portrait malay portrait of you
!oi! if he send you a portrait
it's sus it's very suspicious
any human being that were to do something that is out of the norm
that is going way
bro has he ever met you before
at that point of time no so we we shall stick to no okay so
ultimate red flags a normal person will say hi
not send you a bloody picture
you've never met him before how why is he investing so much time sus sus that is sus
have you ever ask him have you done this to another girl before
a lame ass will do that I'm sorry straight up
(um) cancel the recording
exactly let's be real if
okay we had we had a very bad history where we were at (uh) one of our lowest point of our lives where we we we don't really (um)
check and (um) keep ourself in check in in terms of morals but that is in the past you've used guys before okay so don't act as if you don't even
feel like it's very weird for you to do something without even knowing them fully
you see a damn guy you like their attention but you don't want them what the hell do you do go above and beyond because you don't give a shit about the feelings correct
why is this fella going above and beyond when he doesn't even know you that is red flag because that means you don't even you go with
head first
without thinking about the qualities and stuff like that
has he ever dated before
the fact that you're not mature enough to understand that relationships can go downhill quickly and you still
desperately want to go into a a a a a
not you the fella the fella the fact that you've already
the fact that he was already in a relationship before yet he still not cautious
to be in a relationship in his future relationship that explains a lot where is the maturity
I take my time also but I I
you have to put that shit aside bro
why you talking about him okay K K K K
then make friends
have fun
!wah! ya I can vouch for that
ya actually you're not interested
(mm)
am I right to even assume if this is how he's behaving right now
if
<malay>kalau betul</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tiba-tiba kau dengan dia</malay> together malay malay if <malay>kalau betul kau dengan dia</malay> together
and if if this is like a (uh) continuous pattern
where if you all fight you want to settle with that kind of guy
correct so do you want to make the same mistake
babe
correct so
baby girl
but
listen first stop first he's the first guy that you've ever asked out to ask to go out and then secondly
bullshit
I ask you simple
pressure
but that's the thing I feel like if you've used people before you should already have that confidence
understand what I'm saying to be smart about it I'm your friend but I'm hitting on you
no you know that that's that's how life is what okay so life is don't judge me I I'm right so if you think I'm wrong keep your opinions to yourself I'm kidding no as in
this doesn't match he takes his time knowing someone he sends a portrait to someone doesn't make sense
if you take your bloody ass time you already invest so much and and he
you know the games [lah] bro
can okay no no no no no
this is one of the major mistakes that most of my friends make
you date someone you know nothing about them once you start dating them when you already
you but you're you correct is good that you're not dating them but you never you're not even getting to know them
no getting to know them in terms of how do you deal with relationship not about the family and stuff like that
because that don't mean shit some people out from like fucked up families but they still know how to handle relationships and how to prioritise that and also
ya that's why I tell you be a friend once you be a friend the person is vulnerable enough you are not
you are the piece of shit in the no you
denial
stop the recording
<malay>dah dah dah dah</malay> that's right (err)
understand or not
ya understand you just that
do you hear the crickets
taking it slow
that's why you just all out flirt
a lot of flirt
please [lah] muslim or not as in if you are or not the the
no correct no I'm not saying in terms of flirt when you're with him touch here all these that's the fucking boundary but if if you are texting show that you like
understand show that you like
say just say listen if that that's what I'm saying people
tend to think that if you are my friend I treat you differently
how the fuck do even become your friend then no listen listen no you listen
when you talk to him like a friend that is when you get to be your most vulnerable self
and the flirting turns into like is a conversation how I talk to all my other friends so <malay>kalau</malay> if if <malay>kalau kau tengah berbual dengan dia</malay> and <malay>kau kau macam</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay>
[eh] <malay>kau kelakar</malay> [seh] <malay>aku suka berbual dengan kau</malay>
that is a playful thing correct
but at the same time it will bond you guys together because he has affirmation that [eh] she loves my company
that means I'm I'm I'm secured enough to just bring it one step forward so you're not even doing that you dumb-ass you're not even texting him
that you send a portrait ya it's weird
[ah] see [lah] all the bullshit all come out
cannot cannot cannot they say cannot be distracted [mah] so you pull out your memory cannot cannot nevermind it's okay
exactly why are you talking as if you are his girlfriend
what that is how you talk when you're want to see how is that
what
what you talking about
correct because I don't want to fuck you that's why you no no don't don't later they will disqualify us listen this what I'm telling you
you just like what I say use your flirting skills when he say that kind of stuff
when he say that kind of stuff that is when you should tell him
ya exactly so why you not talking to me that is a flirt you leave the person like [eh] !siala! why she talk like that she want me flirt to her [ah] (oo) #la# #la# so that's when <malay>kalau kau dah cakap macam asal kau tak berbual dengan aku</malay> ya exactly <malay>kau tak nak berbual aku</malay> [pe] <malay>kau</malay> busy <malay>sangat</malay> [pe] I'm not that important
it's a joke right if you say I'm just his friend but you know deep down you've ulterior motive correct so
you say that shit when you are in a freaking relationship you sound like a married woman
who the hell says that
to what to your thoughts [ah] denial
okay <malay>dengar dulu</malay> so after you're in a relationship that after that your partner if they say is it weird <malay>dah dah dah</malay>
even if you're in a relationship you wouldn't fucking say that you will say that I think we should plan a day that is special for us and just go out cause I know you've been very busy
you don't just say I know you're busy [lah] so it's fine K stop [oh] shit that means she doesn't want to talk to me
you know what I'm saying that that is the flaw in you and you want say like I have I have I got you want I pull out the receipt or not don't need to pull out keep it in your damn pocket
laugh laugh some more
(um)
and then sorry it's just me farting
then then do some other shit [lah] bro like
ya ya you have to
no <malay>tak</malay> when you meet him
question him why did you send me the portrait when you don't know me then after that question him do you do this to other girls before that how did you meet your first girlfriend
who else have you send this shit to we might not know for
for a fact he just play these games and those those previous girls reject him
we might not know sorry any guy who does that immediate rejection for me
no you have no self-worth if you do that you have no self-worth
shut the hell up men who are too nice manipulative
are you kidding me bro I have been manipulated that's why
!huh! okay K K I agree I was shaking my head just now
what you mean
in what sense is this a joke like he's he's like playful to you that that is what you mean by that's bullshit shut the fuck up go and stop stop being so fucking blinded really really
twenty twenty
expensive [what]
still can get blind
being a blind ass bitch
ya [lah] if never take care [lor]
ya ridiculous unless you like sixty and then want to die soon [lah]
I want to see the world clearly before I die so I take my last breath make sure my eye open
stupid joy I kidding joy if you are listening to this I don't mean what I say
okay going back
so don't be an idiot
[ah] sorry [lah] it's fucking sus [lah] it's sus very sus very very sus
ya no because to me is like you want to live in denial
if you don't like him I don't mind but you already ask him out
and not even ya like I said if ten years down the road you ask your boyfriend can I meet him your boyfriend ask how did you met meet him he sent me a bloody portrait he knows for sure this fella was head over heels for you he's not going to get you near him
no [lah] for what drink tea
don't be a fucking idiot you're a fucking idiot
maybe maybe that's why that's why he keep saying that like [oh] that's why we [ah] got gap got gap if you are fucking twenty three you're twenty three right if you're twenty three you have that kind of mindset who raised you
like gap [lah] <malay>macam</malay> he probably thinks that <malay>kau macam lagi kaya</malay> or some shit like that right
I know prior to that he keep saying <malay>macam</malay>
you are just
correct so why why must you say that that means you are not working hard enough for you to fulfil yourself in terms of confidence
what is it is it that you are a if he get you then what the he climb up the tier is it which is disgusting [what] right
acting [eh] <malay>macam kau</malay> self-realisation <malay>padahal tak ada apa-apa habuk pun takde</malay>
no like is it like <malay>macam</malay> is it
like a a are you a trophy which okay I'm not saying that
then why does he speak like that
how is the previous girl let's be what is the previous girlfriend like how is she
the previous girlfriend
so how many years and when was it
eighteen nineteen is
no it's not young it's not young what are you talking about it's like
a relationship okay a question okay so how did he got with the girl how did he get with the girl
some app what app
muslim
sus
what the fuck [oh] my god
[oh] my god why wait what it's just let to me specific Tinder <malay>atau</malay> (uh) Okcupid
I've I've use it before ya so I have a strong judgement
Muzmatch is muslim
he use he use muslim one [ah]
okay a lot of vulnerable people
so
the fact that he
Muzmatch is good there's a lot of (um) naive girls because you really really go through <malay>macam</malay>
to to the tee <malay>punya macam</malay> this [one] really my mother and my father must know if I go out date with you must bring you home must tell mummy daddy that is okay that's fine if you have the maturity of
we're going to go out on dates and if I were to speak to you it's official
like there's no such grey fucking area of
(hmm) I'm the friend but I ask him out he's the first ever guy that asked me out so no but it's real so
that that's why to me you've went out with a girl
you've been cheated on you went on the app [lah] correct right
and then after that now you behave in this very desperate manner maybe because to me so many other guys don't fucking do that but obviously
him he's weird
okay so the girl is what religious also
how why and why
how can you be friends with a friend that dated you and send you a bloody portrait
who's #amin# which guy
#amin# <malay>abeh</malay> #amin#
okay ya what's up with him
which is still sus to me
right now it's fine listen it's fine because you're single
it's not fine once you have a boyfriend
correct ya this shit will end bro it will end if you really love your boyfriend you will listen to your boyfriend hundred percent if your boyfriend say <malay>tak nak kau</malay> you won't <malay>kau tak akan</malay> break up <malay>dengan mata air kau</malay> just to <malay>lepak dengan budak</malay> #syafiq# <malay>ni</malay> that means you're saying that this fella is much more important than that guy
you are giving yourself a lot of bullshit
but you're single so it's fine
can
can but
if your correct if if if shit gets comfortable then you say I just want to hang with my friends then your boyfriend say [ah] <malay>buat apa</malay>
<malay>sorang-sorang buat apa</malay>
is there drama now with you and #amin#
okay so he got say that he's over you and he's not dating another person or did he give like some vague answer
why
so you friendzone him
so what do you like him
no back then
babe you fucking weird
you fucking weird because once you have a guy these are not your friends anymore you are just making yourself lose friendship serious
serious
then you won't lose him but you will lose other guys that you've dated before I would never let my guy
get close to any motherfuckers any girls that ever fucking went out with him
okay I'm not possessive [ah] listen [ah] okay I have my boundaries but it's just weird
let me ask you now
which is weirder bro
if you have a boyfriend
now I ask you he say okay I go out with a girl I've dated before with another girl that is there
how would you feel exactly my point you cannot be very oblivious about this thing you're going to lose friendship you are already losing it bro
you have to pick your battle choose one what the fuck
because this is my criteria to my my boyfriend
correct obviously you can say but think about the long run you're going to lose them either ways
so no that's why no that's why to me is
to me right if my I I just I give this
I'm very liberal it doesn't sound like throughout this recording but okay
when my partner were to tell me [oh] I'm talking to this fella (um)
and then after I say okay (um)
how did you meet her
and then after that [oh] through Instagram
this girl is trying to get to know me immediate no because to me
you can what is friends is if got fate make it
(uh) fate [eh] that you and this girl fucking one out of how many billion people in the entire world but you
physically met that that fella you all had conversations you all click she was there at your lowest when she was there at your lowest she gave you time
give you motivation to bring you up when you were a piece of motherfucking shit
#platonically# as friends
I cannot touch because that person was there for you I'm eternally grateful
you can hang but I must also be introduced and that that fella also then that's the part where where once I'm in I give the green light I meet the girl and I need to see for myself
if she has any ulterior motive because let's be real anybody that we date were
people who are possible candidates right why didn't I I date you
because I don't like you <malay>atau</malay> you don't like me either ways there was something more than a friend you give me no fucking purpose you give me money <malay>aku kasi</malay> (uh) I <malay>aku kasi kau berbual dengan dia dia tak bayar kau duit</malay>
<malay>atau dia bagi kau</malay> knowledge <malay>dia tak bagi kau</malay> opportunities in life get the fuck out because I'm your fucking best friend cause to me is like
you are playing with fire you let your partner date hang with a girl that they dated before
you are just going to lose lose what if one day you argue with your partner then after that he go and text the girl
and then after that the girl say ya for what also you want to talk to her it's just going to add it's fucking toxic unless you become friends with the the
no no such thing as date sorry for me is bullshit because you all she didn't give you any benefit let's be real people are selfish and you know your own motives if you don't like that girl that girl probably likes you why must she even give hope to that fella
to that girl even if she date already [what] then her boyfriend don't give her the self-respect [meh] to like just cut off guys that she date before right
so the thing is you need to be and [ah] if you want to talk about F (uh) [ah] friends friends I got a lot of friends #lan jiao# [lah] must be one of them must be your date [meh]
like you don't have any workmates [meh] you don't you're not motivated in life
to have any fucking goals to be busy with other shit than to <malay>lepak</malay>
no you are single so it's fine but you already setting yourself
for hell basically because no [lah] it's bullshit [lah] if your partner do that to you I I mean you can take it [meh]
no because you don't give a shit
which is even more weird because but is weird because then what if you're giving him hope and
if okay a guy that I
correct and the fact that he still wants to stay when you give nos no purpose at all
so doesn't fucking prove anything like you don't give him money you don't give him time you don't give him knowledge
you make him laugh for fuck
correct correct you make him laugh you make him laugh and for fuck that just makes him even more attracted and loves your company which makes your boyfriend feel a bit what the fuck
why are you making other guys laugh especially the guy that pursued you before
so same thing if if if my guy
I'm not gonna lie I I'm I was insecure but now I don't give a fucking shit because a lot of girls
texted him like I really had to go through that shit especially when my my relationship back then was was private
I had to go through that shit and I learnt that actually
if my the
you shouldn't get angry at people who date your boyfriend you should get angry at your boyfriend for not knowing how to act if you act this way you think your boyfriend will be
would would not get mad with you [meh] he will get mad [what] <malay>pasal kau dah kau dah pernah berbual dengan dorang</malay> and and the way that your and your boyfriend will probably be pissed off because
the way that he get to know you is probably the same way that these motherfuckers did
he's not gonna be and this is bullshit [eh] if let's say you went out with this fella and with
#syafiq# the one that you never date what #amin# #syafiq# okay so #amin# is the one you date before
so if you went out with #amin# and #syafiq# okay if your boyfriend were to say nevermind at the end of the day she comes back home to me
let's not be fucking stupid humans will interfere with your relationship humans can just say any fucking shit I've met so many guys that desperately wants my hot girlfriend relationship to fucking break
so they pretend to be that guy friend that is close to that girl and then he's not not for you [ah] [eh] just break up [ah]
then after they get close date which is I know motive girls guys I don't
hate on anyone but if you are stupid on your actions that's the part where I have to call that bullshit [eh] like bro what the fuck you doing you know and I'm not saying that you are stupid obviously you're not is the guy the guy is stupid because
if #syafiq# keeps telling you [eh] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] when the first meeting problem starts with [eh] I didn't before [sia] there's there's gonna be this part of like
[eh] I got talk to her before I got date her before [oh] now she talking to that guy [ah]
sad or it's weird sorry it's weird
to him for him
(mm) [ah] you (mm) [ah] (mm) (mm)
because you are you trying to say that [oh] he's just a friend which is not like if if your partner ya you say that your partner do the same thing you're not gonna accept it
and then you want to ya [lah] me
that's why I'm telling you this this this fella is not a friend so you have to this #syafiq# [eh] no #akim# guy #akim# #akim# you need to just
play your game well just say [lor] like
flirt to text not to sext
I would say because <malay>dia</malay> very religious [kan] <malay>kau</malay> just <malay>cakap macam</malay> just playfully flirt [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
things that make him feel like [oh] she really wants my attention like [eh] <malay>kau tak berbual dengan aku</malay> [eh] <malay>dah lama tak rindu</malay> [seh] or something like that so
it's not <malay>haram</malay> [what] I mean okay it is <malay>haram</malay> because you have the intention but then
to make it quick to because you don't have any balls to be like can we just date cause I know you like me no desperate motherfucker would send me a portrait so [ah] shit I still cannot get it out of my system
that's weird as fuck so like he
you straight up ask him you got send any other girl portraits or not
if you're not if he say like you sound like you're jealous shut the fuck up weird fuck you are the one who's fucking weird so you tell me now do you send any girl's portrait
and is not sense of controlling it's because you know
how humans manipulate and the things that they do sometimes if a guy were to slap your face they come back they apologise give you ten thousand ring you will say okay the effort is there
people go through that shit so I don't want you to be [eh] he send me that gift is a good gesture I can also say I send you fucking ten apples good gesture you eat that shit is rotten [what] right
so you need to understand I know I have three I have three boys in my house
all of them are motherfuckers back then I know all the fucking tricks that are up their sleeve it's so easy to
here's the thing
when you get close to a guy they start to become vulnerable the real side of them come out so when the real side of them come out that's easy for them to be like K #chao#
you know what I'm saying so if you like if you start to feel like you're agitated and you like him and you start to miss him
make it happen when you guys are dating so that when the red flag comes you are not in a relationship for you to just like if you are in a relationship you cannot let go [what]
but if you're dating you can let go right so
so many of my friends are ya officially dating this guy
and that is fine because we are dating [mah] officially you're officially dating so
ya some people date two to three people ya that is using [ah] but
some people that date their their their partner officially it it it gives
how to say [ah] people will lie to impress you so you need to be smart [lah] for me for me is like
I don't like people who lie I don't like people who chase after me I don't like people who like <malay>macam</malay> step (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> [eh] (uh) like you can flirt [lah] but then like
at least have the sense of (um) intelligence when you talk to me because if you if you're trying to say that (uh) you are insecure or whatnot sorry go to a fucking therapist I cannot fix that
<malay>faham tak</malay> it's so many red flags sorry but
[eh] [eh] (uh) no if I were you
I would further <malay>macam</malay> I would pursue him
for me to find out more red flags
so
!wah!
still not exact
ya just ask all the fucking shit as if you are you are interested in him
<malay>faham tak</malay> so <malay>bila kau dah macam</malay> together <malay>dengan dia</malay> not not if let's say he starts to
if there's this intense heat where he feels like okay maybe she's the one [ah] like I like her morals and stuff like that and she shows some some interest to me I think I should date her
so then when once he say that and you say okay
pattern all come out
weird bro portrait the fuck
like it's either you are a good boy <malay>atau</malay> you are manipulative
it's weird
it's weird bro
imagine [eh] if you didn't you don't get with him
you get with your boyfriend that is way more fucking secure
he will shit on this motherfucker bro
for real !huh! <malay>dia hantar</malay> you portrait <malay>kimak budak-budak kental</malay> [pe] [sia] confirm <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay>
obviously you want a guy that chase after you but not a guy who doesn't fucking know you
what what if he does this behind your back don't know that girl fucking pretty send her portrait while he's with you
it's weird [what] it's fucking weird bro
you <malay>kena</malay> cheated also [eh] we might know he's fucking seeing girls now we don't know
I'm not trying to (uh) anyhow to do [ah] but
through the Muzmatch also
just catch up is it
this was how old
[oh] so his relationship was like three years [ah]
#pukiwek# three years <malay>abeh kena</malay> cheated [eh] !siala!
with the first girl
#kiwek# okay [lah]
then he got single then he dated that girl
(uh huh)
I need to know the timeline so initially she said that she wants this this this this they went out how many times
correct have to ask all that babe because
this will all boils down to who he is as a person so ya okay continue
no [lah] with the insecurities bullshit
to marry is it
but that's not the important thing
correct so number one if she were to ask you need to ask how many times did you guys did you guys went out so she already so if she state it before she went out that I want this type of guy
[oh] so she state it when
okay okay then
correct (um) so she went out with that guy not telling him the expectations
(um)
but whenever they go out she got say she what she like what she don't like
you need to ask for details so if he is the type of man that is like <malay>macam</malay>
which is to me that is the right way to be in a relationship so if he's complaining
fucking buck up [ah] bro like if if that girl don't if she wants to be treated as a proper muslim I don't want to be in a in a dark setting cause anything can happen I cannot see shit I don't want to be in this (uh) this setting we're just together
then if you like her do whatever it takes it shows you as a person
that basic that's basic I should not applaud him for that
ya basic babe no you know why
no because you not from Muzmatch [mah]
right so Muzmatch I have a friend
<malay>kawan aku</malay> legit <malay>bila aku kecil-kecil</malay> [kan] <malay>dia memang betul</malay> religious <malay>habis</malay> the family and very <malay>baik</malay> so
shy <malay>baik</malay> and are religious so she she talk to guys from Muzmatch Muzmatch because she's shy to talk to guys in real life and she's also very religious so is very scary [lah] for you to just <malay>macam</malay> socialise [what]
then (um)
she's the type that don't even wear <malay>tudung depan</malay> (uh) <malay>pakcik makcik</malay>
so legit [eh] <malay>ada orang datang pakai tudung pakai tudung</malay> that kind of thing <malay>atau macam</malay>
[eh] (uh) <malay>berbual pun baik macam budi bahasa macam lembut</malay> so when when she go out with these kind of (uh) men (uh)
I know her standards like you need to ask ya like I like that she go go out on a date also
but fucking wary of
(um) <malay>pasal</malay> everyday they remind themselves [ah] [oh] <malay>jin selalu ada kalau tempat dua-dua berduaan jin cepat masuk</malay> that's fucking true let's be real <malay>macam</malay> and and that's why to me
(um) (uh) asking parents for for take that is the norm of how a muslim
especially a daughter
so I shouldn't applaud you for that because
you put yourself in Muzmatch [what] you should know the criteria [what] as a man also you should lead your family one day then you have this kind of thing then after that want to complain you cannot complain [what] because if you don't get the girl then shut up [lah] so
in my head is like (um) if she already said that I want this this this this you you shouldn't complain cause if that's not the type of girl the ratio of the halal and <malay>haram</malay> is not for you
deep bro because then you're just wasting your damn time
<malay>kau masih nak</malay> try try try <malay>tapi kau tak</malay> up there then how nobody's asking you for a lot of money people asking you for respect towards the girl so this is (um)
how do I say this [ah] everytime I give my friend benefit of the doubt I'm always right so <malay>macam</malay>
get to know him give him the benefit of the doubt
eventually will come true whatever I say maybe because whether it was lame maybe that's why <malay>sekarang ni dia macam cakap ni cakap tu</malay> so if she she say she don't want it then <malay>kalau</malay> (um)
he should know better [what] right that's what I'm saying you should have Muzmatch [sia] this is not like <malay>macam remeh-temeh</malay> girl [tau] it's not like <malay>macam</malay>
modern kind of girl where they are open-minded [tau] you have so many religious girls that are like you know very strict about shit
so the primary school girl still has the criteria right
so how is it different than (uh) if you know that she's religious how is it different
right so so ya exactly so this is the dumbest shit that people do they date first then they become friends no
for me is I'm going to use my skills to flirt and be your friend
for me to and not because like [eh] <malay>aku</malay> no no no I mean my gift #alhamdulillah# is I can make anybody be fucking comfortable with me so I use that to my advantage
for you to spit out every fucking shit even you're vulnerable side because when you tell me about your vulnerability then I start to understand that
(um) (uh) how do you cope with that vulnerability so if you say like I'm actually
I'm nowhere where I'm at now but I fucking promise one day I'll get up there that is the kind of fucking response I want to get from a man <malay>faham tak</malay>
you're at his fucking like stage in life where your fucking life is so hard like <malay>macam</malay> you're going through a lot of (uh) problems but you have so much to do with it
you are not small boy it's not like [eh] family <malay>aku</malay> my family is (uh) (uh) poor I mean (uh) <malay>mak bapa aku sakit abeh aku masih kat sekolah</malay>
<malay>itu aku boleh bagi</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> #buto# <malay>kalau kau tengah kerja kau masih nak</malay> complain
you know that's why in my in my head is like <malay>macam</malay>
find the red flags I I I think I'm I'm saying this because a lot of negative shit happened in my life that I just know
what are red flags and what is not
and like <malay>macam</malay> I just see through the fucking bullshit I'm not going to lie sometimes when I date date someone also
(uh) I'm blinded that was the one <malay>yang dengan</malay> the arab guy that I was with <malay>yang macam aku betul-betul sayang</malay> but <malay>dia macam</malay>
cause of the hierarchy and the how the family view me
you don't hear me saying like [oh] fuck I'm a malay I cannot [eh] shut the fuck up I can date ten fucking arabs guy arab guy once I'm up there when I'm the same level as them because that is what I want to pursue you want to get
this kind of fella you fucking fight for it you don't
like <malay>dalam</malay> islam <malay>pun cakap</malay> a good girl is for a good guy if you don't get it maybe you should self-check so <malay>cakap dengan dia gitu</malay> maybe that's why I don't get the girl is so simple as that
if if you want to say that <malay>kalau kau nak macam</malay> if you play by insecurity saying that !aiya! <malay>aku tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku ni buruk aku tahu</malay> [lah]
and then <malay>diam</malay> [lah] [sial] <malay>macam</malay> do something about it because you're not handicapped there's so many other people that <malay>kena</malay> burn on the face
and can do nothing about it but did they fucking complain no like <malay>macam</malay> ya so
at and and and even if you are fucking ugly but the the determination is fucking attractive
so like like I said all these acts of
is very scary to me scary
sending sending portrait then like you big fuck
you already fucking put your dignity on the fucking floor you step on it already you send a girl a portrait what the fuck sorry <malay>aku macam</malay> really that's that's weird
<malay>macam</malay>
it's weird [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
it's weird too it's weird to me it's weird [lah] unless you good boy but you good boy also it's fucking lame [what] like
how to say [ah] it's weird it's weird unless <malay>kau macam</malay>
if if you put yourself out in the media
then I understand
like ya so if let's say you are youtuber or whatnot then people send stuff
fan mail then legit <malay>kena</malay> call fan [sia] fan I also want to vomit [sia] !huh! <malay>kau</malay> fanatic <malay>dia ni</malay> when she's just a pretty girl there's no such thing other than that
I mean obviously you are gorgeous but you have to understand that
lame dudes I don't want to call him lame but I'm always right so let me just say that
no you should tell him straight [ah] [eh] <malay>kimak kau</malay> lame [pe] <malay>kau hantar perempuan gini</malay> that means before <malay>aku kau hantar perempuan apa</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tiba-tiba</malay>
what the fuck do you do with your free time <malay>kau</malay> scroll <malay>perempuan lawa pastu kau hantar</malay> portrait
did you know what I'm saying
[ah] so before he send you the portrait you all talk before
in real life or
message shut the fuck up then shut the fuck up then there's so many people I talk through message also and I don't give a shit that was the those are the least kind of people that I give a fuck about because I
I never go out with them you have to understand if you text a serial killer
don't know what they are serial killer until you go out with them correct
why are you putting yourself in a fucking position
shut the fuck up you already like him
if you don't like him right trust me if you don't like him I I know that <malay>kau perangai kakak-kakak kau punya orang boleh</malay> steady <malay>punya tapi kau dah kau dah suka</malay>
this is what I want my friend to do to me also if I'm fucking blinded as fuck
legit legit portrait is already how many times I have to say I think ten thousand times in this recording [ah]
they need to type [ah] their to
[ah] transcript !huh! portrait copy paste copy paste
<malay>faham tak</malay>
you like the company
but you won't love you won't correct because let's be real
for me before this also I impress all of the guys that I want to go out with
once you date me you die already you die already all my my <malay>macam</malay> bipolar attitude
all my shout I tell you already [what] I'm abusive [what] back then [lah] you know like I don't give a like bro <malay>aku boleh ambil kaca aku boleh campak</malay> [sia] <malay>muka kau pun aku boleh pecah</malay> [kan] [sia] and as a guy also
you cannot leave the mentality is that I'm a guy so I cannot whack back
#chao# if you're not leaving me also you don't have any self-worth the fact that I'm so into personal growth
is because that is the truth in life
who the fuck <malay>macam</malay> owes you a fucking living that you have to change them your mother father [lah] but not your partner <malay>faham tak</malay> so
that's why to me is like if you are at this stage to like <malay>kau dah</malay> mature enough don't lower your standard for a man who doesn't
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be with him I have friends who literally the the guy <malay>masuk</malay> jail <malay>cakap</malay> once you are a millionaire then you marry me and he fucking learn [eh]
in jail [eh] say once I get past my O levels I will marry (uh) and I'll once I become a millionaire I will pursue you and I will chase after you and I'll marry you men will go to that extend even me
let's be real if the person is worth it so he give you a portrait when he doesn't even fucking know you that's weird
that is weird let's see <malay>kalau kau betul-betul</malay> cut contact let's see who else he send the portrait to bet [ah]
that is what I used to [what] that's a fucking pattern [what] you know nobody changes overnight
you send a portrait you got the girl so easy that's why I tell you to play the game
like him you can like him look at his red flags once he blow you off then you know how to cut
<malay>faham tak</malay> cause
don't waste your time you are a I mean I don't want to say you lower your standards [ah] but you deserve so much more
to be in this position with a guy that send you a portrait
[oh] whatever I'm hearing I'm sorry I'm I'm okay one thing is I'm very protective of my friends number two
I can just see shit
clearly
just now cannot [lah] because not twenty twenty vision [mah] put braces [mah] my eyes
ya so that's why <malay>aku cakap kau</malay> it it all takes time [what] people especially when you like someone bro
they lie people lie
and you've never been he been been (uh) at his lowest point of (uh) point in his life have you ever be that <malay>kau tengok kau boleh tahan ke tak</malay>
then you will know if you're fucking mature or not
[oh] maybe that's why you have a job that won't allow you to fucking (um) pursue a better goal
you fucking tell me <malay>engkau</malay> then <malay>apa diam</malay> [ah] [sial] then you want you have a better goal [lah] like it's simple as that <malay>macam</malay>
if my brother that's a dropout can fucking earn (uh) like maybe because
how to say [ah] when you've already tasted a higher standard of living you just want to work for it
one day I can assume about him benefit of the doubt is maybe he he has never tasted a better life of living maybe he don't have that knowledge he's not blessed with that knowledge so
that's why you as a you you you say you are a friend right bless him with that knowledge see what he will do with it
but at the same time like
don't settle down for what you're not satisfied with serious for me a guy I need to be like fucking like a monkey
for me to legit be like pursuing you if you make me no sorry
if if it's more of like I want to get to I really want to get to know this guy he has everything like
how to say [ah] for me
I'm not there yet so I don't even
I didn't even want to date because I don't want to settle for less so for me it's like looks
(uh) dressing and morals
then after that once I really really really really like you because everything is fine then I will just pursue chemistry
chemistry is there
if if he really likes me then
(uh) that that that that's where I play my game <malay>faham tak</malay> of like
okay I think I should give him a bit more attention I really really like him but at the same time
I don't pursue guys who are fifty fifty about me because
you can like people keep saying like [oh] you like
I think people like to see me as like confident like she can get that guy nope is I just don't waste time with people that I know I cannot get
like must have to realistic like not like there's so many people much more good looking than me and there's so much
(um) like I have a lot to work on but
I pick my battle [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay this guy is enough for me
then if it's not enough then I make myself enough
you know that kind of thing so people that that rush into relationship are sus
sus send portrait sus
tell you before [leh] fuck bro <malay>kimak aku punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>dulu</malay> [eh] <malay>perempuan hantar dia macam</malay>
[eh] I saw you around school you look cute <malay>aku maki</malay> [sia] #buto# <malay>siapa perempuan ni dia nak tengok-tengok</malay> you <malay>buat apa dia pasal</malay> what
cause he's fucking fat !wah! fuck you #chibai# want to fucking look look look shut the fuck up [ah] want to look at my boyfriend for what
#buto# I cannot because but then that was when I was insecure but now when I realise that
my boyfriend has to reassure me I feel lame
because to me is I fucking sound psychotic but but that is what
people do
so if you as a man behave like a desperate fucker I cannot I cannot
if you chase after a girl as if you have no self send portrait if my boyfriend fucking do that I'll smack the shit out of him obviously you can send portraits to me if
this is weird babe nobody fucking do that nobody fucking do that I'm scared if
insecurities will come up
not you you obviously don't but if if
no what if your insecurities come out he play with it
<malay>faham tak</malay>
<malay>asal kau</malay> you can be vulnerable but at the same time you have you have to be like I know I know sleepy
you you can be vulnerable but at the same time just say like
[oh] anytime if I want to cut you off which is good [lah] I think you have low low tolerance also for bullshit I'm hoping [ah]
(mm) (mm)
correct so
<malay>bapa aku</malay> [sia] <malay>nama bapa aku</malay> [sial]
in a man
and then
fuck it fuck [ah]
which is
correct correct
he did all the work what work need to work [meh]
ya isn't that good
!huh!
but then
[ah] that's fine
correct
correct you have to understand there's
I have so many hot ass
fucking girlfriends
that get with a fucking ugly guy because he's charismatic
insecure
correct insecure
I'm also charismatic how many people that I use
so many worse is you date a guy that is ugly and cheated on you might as well date a good looking guy
right so that's why to me is like
but I'm not okay I'm just throwing the worst of the worst so that you know how to react quick with fear
then you're much more clearer instead of nevermind just let it be it's okay so that's why I'm telling you <malay>kalau</malay>
obviously that that that I think that's how life should be that you date someone that is
the looks
people say that looks don't matter suck my dick [lah] !huh! looks and also (um)
not status looks and (um) body language
when that is okay then after that your your
(uh) no no looks and confidence so
confidence might also play with the look so if you're actually fucking ugly but you have a lot of confidence because you have a lot of skills that people look up to
you're already fucking good looking already that is looks to me not just physical then after that is the the charismatic so
if he if he's not confident he don't pass the confidence <malay>punya</malay>
(mm) test
you gonna die
ya it's pandemic all over again
if this you choose this fella is the one that you're gonna marry and this (uh) and if you have to you have to teach a man how to work on his own
fuck that shit
and a man who's very very independent on on the on the on the partner (uh) (uh) toxic
you depend on the partner to change toxic
you can obviously
advise but it's what he do
so many people can rise up but it's how much they want it
wait but then saturday sunday <malay>kau buat apa kau keluar dengan dia</malay>
okay ya then then just hang with them like <malay>macam</malay> you want to have fun that is that is that is proper fun bro
don't don't need to date men
when you're in the grey area don't need to
motherfucker you just fucking told me you ask him out that's a fucking date for fucking sure bro he's not your friend
stop it like <malay>macam</malay> if you tell your if tell your [oh] my god I don't accept that shit like my my partner got tell me before <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] I went out with this girl I <malay>tak pernah</malay> I <malay>tak pernah</malay>
<malay>dia gila-gila</malay> [kan] I <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak pernah</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
but you reciprocate
my boyfriend said that he doesn't he just use like he just know that [oh] this girl got got <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
this guy has other hot girlfriends at that point of time he was single okay so he was single until I was the first girl that he dated so he's good looking so a
he was dating a lot of girls
but he don't like anyone of them so if you're single you're free to be a fucking cunt [what] right so when
he see that girl as an opportunity to get to know other hot chicks so
when she him and saying that [oh] you're so cute
he's like a before me he was a fucking flirt cause he's single but he try to play off like I'm just a friend [what] but I know you're fucking flirt you know
before that I was I never use people before because of him I used people because of what happened then after that (um)
when you get close to the girl the girl obviously like like him but then he with
all due respect like he try to not I don't even know if he does that [lah] but he said as like <malay>macam</malay> okay I'm just your friend I'm just your friend but then I #simplicate# whatever text you send me so he told me that he never liked her at all
and he was friendzoning her because she got other hot chicks hot friends
and then that is to me is like then okay [lor] then I'm not that mad at the fact that you still keep in contact but at the end of the day
once he was a bit more serious with me he cut contact with that girl because he knows that I'm not happy but I told him I'm fucking liberal
you want to fucking go out with her because she got connection because she can give you some sort of like <malay>macam</malay> (um)
help with <malay>ke apa</malay> #lan jiao#
go ahead with it or whatever <malay>kalau macam nak tanya</malay> advice about <malay>macam kerja</malay> in the future <malay>ke apa</malay> go ahead with it but I'm not
going to allow you to meet her face to face and and it just gives
like <malay>macam</malay> is not more of like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I reciprocate back
so right now you are reciprocating back if your boyfriend were to tell you in the future you <malay>ada keluar dengan dia tak</malay> you <malay>pernah keluar dengan dia tak</malay> I was fond of him [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak pernah mata air dengan dia</malay>
what like you reciprocate like it's more nicer to hear that [oh]

put so much weight into your your decisions people make mistakes if he's not the one you shouldn't be like [eh] he's the first guy I asked
