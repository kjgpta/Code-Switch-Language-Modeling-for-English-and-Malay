!wow!
!siala!
young marriages [eh]
the first thing is the first thing in my mind is just divorce ya
!oof!
like that thing <malay>anak luar nikah</malay> [jer]
like child before marriage
no like okay maybe they got married at eighteen <malay>pasal ada anak</malay>
(mm)
foolish this tough man like
!wow! there's a lot of way way [sia] <malay>macam</malay>
okay !wow! wait I need to like plan this out like I need to do
okay young marriages [eh] okay I think
okay <malay>dalam segi agama</malay> I would say okay like really just wise like follow your religious maybe it's a good thing [lah] like just to settle down like (err) <malay>apa</malay> to prevent like any sins or any like (um) what does it call
no no (mm) <malay>haram</malay> and thing and like <malay>macam</malay> (um) (uh) what is it <malay>macam</malay> the bad like people won't talk bad about you what does that thing call
something like that ya is like you know (err) like people said you are so young like you know like obviously people judge right
but then is like you can ya we are married you know we are not dong anything wrong we are not ya they are not doing anything wrong what they are not doing anything wrong
so <malay>macam apa</malay> ya
divorce
!oof!
okay
okay
okay
okay
they want to get married like what by by by two years time in a year's time
but they
I think like getting married and having a family is two different things
ya so what are you what do you have in mind getting married or building up a family
honestly no [ah] because like <malay>nanti macam ingat kau macam main main</malay>
like you think what this [one] <malay>main main</malay> is it like you what your girlfriend you break up patch back patch back <malay>merepek</malay> [what]
ya so like I think okay maybe eighteen is a legal age but no I think that's like marriage like maybe that's too young but unless like how to say like [ah] I've heard [lah] stories <malay>macam aku nampak yang</malay> they got married at seventeen or sixteen ya <malay>islam</malay>
that's the thing I don't know is it in singapore or malaysia [ah] malaysia <malay>ku entah</malay> [leh] maybe it's normal maybe is not [lah] but like they say like you know then I see and the thing is the best part is that both parents like (err) what is <malay>restu</malay>
[ah] [ah] they give <malay>restu</malay> [ah] they give I the blessing [ah] <malay>dorang kasih</malay> blessing <malay>dorang</malay>
then it's like !wow! like that's I think that's takes a lot of courage [ah] for parents <malay>nak kasih restu</malay> like to cover him at the young age but then we don't know what the reason the actual reason behind [lah] [kan]
then
now the only thing I can think of when you say young marriage is like maybe they did something or maybe they just like <malay>tak sabar</malay>
they just want to like so <malay>macam</malay> like [oh]
if I get married [oh] you know everything will be like <malay>halal</malay> you know <malay>macam ni ni ni ni</malay> like actually [ah] he's the one or like you know what I don't know how to explain but like <malay>macam</malay>
at least like whatever you do right like people can't really like judge you that much because like you're not doing anything wrong ya you're not giving a bad image you're just young
you just look young
ya
ya
so if later <malay>macam</malay> if it's just reflects to the people and there's like [oh] <malay>kau tengah</malay> stereotype just because I'm young
and I I I have a children that means we're not married ya
<malay>apa</malay>
!oof! that is like
time [eh] I don't think
I don't know I don't
for me [ah] okay [ah] <malay>kalau kau tanya aku persendirian aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] because like I think I I really believe <malay>yang macam apa ya</malay> love does not <malay>apa ya</malay> time does not define love <malay>ke</malay> love does not define time <malay>ada kat</malay> that thing [ah]
like <malay>kalau kau jatuh cinta kalau kau like you and then you feel like he's the one he's the one [ah] because like I heard stories like my <malay>apa apanya cikgu</malay>
she was in a relationship ever since like in secondary school <malay>sampai ke tua</malay> like twenty six like that she was schooling my school like she was ready she was asking to marriage but then guy still wanted to play around
like <malay>macam</malay> he he wasn't serious he still don't want to get married
no no not not the other chicks [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> he's just not ready for marriage <malay>dia tak dia tak belum fikir</malay> [kan] [lah] okay for my <malay>cikgu</malay> [kan] she's like okay let's say <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] ya
okay the guy likes to <malay>lepak jam beberapa jam ke dua tiga pagi</malay> [tau] just <malay>lepak bawa blok berbual-bual rokok tu semua</malay> right my teacher is like by eleven is like [eh] <malay>aku tak penat jah</malay> like I want to go home I want to sleep like so like that ya so <malay>macam</malay> they they I think it's like eight years' relationship
ya ya they call it off they <malay>dia orang tak tunang pun</malay> ya they broke up she broke up with him and then after that (err) <malay>kak</malay> got to know
she again she started to you know go (err) around
find new people think she dated one I think like less than a year and I saw she <malay>tunang</malay> and then after that a year after that she got married ya ya
ya that's the thing like actually I was shocked that she she like she was okay [lah] maybe <malay>dia ada rasa sedih</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>siapa tak rasa sedih</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> break up
but she's like you know what this is not what I want like like she knows what she wants <malay>tu aku yang jawab aku</malay> respect <malay>kau</malay> [ah]
and the fact that she told me at I was what eighteen at that point I was eighteen at that point she was twenty six then I was like !wah!
but ya
and I think she just started like schooling like [eh] no not I mean working at that school like maybe about one year or two years around that ya around that
tie tie want to tie tie a knot
ya babe but that's you [ah] like everyone is different also [what]
okay to me I would say like
you really follow me [ah] [eh] <malay>kalau ikutkan hati aku</malay>
I mean like I've been single for the longest time for so <malay>macam</malay> like
you know you just gonna get any guy then <malay>kalau</malay> like <malay>kau</malay> okay <malay>aku</malay> okay <malay>kita</malay> go [ah] [sia]
but then it's like okay let's say <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>kau dengan</malay> my dear <malay>kau berapa lama</malay>
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot or not
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot
<malay>boleh</malay> but then you think your parents will agree
[ah]
(mm)
what ya money wise but go back to that question that you said in papers you can be managed with through papers [what] then after that then you can build up your life [what] financially
why
[oh] <malay>tak boleh sambung</malay> (uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya I think I've heard stories like they they they just like marry by paper but they still <malay>macam</malay> go on [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think they are like schooling or something <malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>kes kalau ni</malay> [ah]
they just sign papers they just get married they think like they're the one you know like each other soul mates sign then
from there [ah] then <malay>masuk</malay> like okay [lah] slowly <malay>perlahan perlahan kayuh</malay> [ah]
(mm)
ya
for generation I think like I think it depends on the society [ah]
society <malay>nya sekarang</malay> now is like I think <malay>apa</malay> ever since okay let's say our generation [ah] [eh] like okay let's say my after our parents' generation like maybe the like early nineties or like the late eighties all of them run dusted the career minded path <malay>semua yang tak nak kahwin pun</malay>
so it's like
yes correct workaholics that's the word
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that that's what I feel because of like where we live the society that we live in that like that's how we live that's how it is
that's how we grew up like we need money if no money we die
ya
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
honestly I I don't think singapore only [ah] I think it's just right now everywhere okay fine maybe

[ah] <malay>kau nak</malay> complain <malay>pasal</malay> [ah] <malay>apa apa apa</malay> (err) birth rate (uh) decreasing of birth rate because <malay>kau nak suruh aku kerja dua kerja</malay> [eh]

(mm)
yes yes
[oh] me sorry
typical [lor] Grab
why
why
I don't have a bike I don't have
ya exactly the only thing that were that [one] is just time [ah] <malay>minyak</malay> okay [lah] let's say we don't we don't use the the the car or the bike [ah] we use scooter
this scooter also like take up battery
so
<malay>tak ke</malay> minister <malay>gila nak sama kita kerja dua job</malay>
and the thing is you know okay like my
places
my places places <malay>apa</malay>
okay <malay>tempat kerja aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> they they have this form to let (uh) what does it call [ah] <malay>macam</malay> and need to sign [ah] let's say like [oh] to confirm that I'm not working another job you know that thing [ah] [ah] [ah] that [one]
then I'm like so what I cannot work another job ya
ya so how am I suppose to work
the second job ya I mean obviously <malay>saya nak saya boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> still !haiya! <malay>entahlah</malay> I really think it's a bit
bullshit for for them to want ask to work two jobs
ya
let's say <malay>kau kerja</malay> government government based job
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> second job <malay>tak akan</malay> [eh] you cannot you cannot have two government jobs also [what]
[ah]
like but our minister said can
the court minister say can
ya
if like that means right is like okay I'm working for full time and then my side business let's say
to do the bake bake (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
bake cookies [ah] let's say [ah] [ah] home based [ah]
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> ya so <malay>aku kerja</malay> full time <malay>abeh lepas tu</malay>
side business is bake cookies okay [what] is so do you consider that is a second job or is that just a like but then you said already said is really say side hustle
but also time and effort way to do that effort [sia] because you do that as a second job
so
so

!huh!
same [lah] like split
(mm) actually
I think right all these personality is just in our head just that they are special to show it out we don't like we normal like normal people ya ya there's one part in the movie I like right
the going to the last part [ah] <malay>apa</malay> (uh) when the beast came out
ya the beast came out then the girl like was ready with the short gun [kan] then <malay>lepas begitu</malay> (uh) <malay>dia gitu</malay> (err) <malay>dia macam dia nak bunuh</malay> [pe] talking about pure and impure you know about that part
remember
[oh] my [eh] you should you should
basically the girl has <malay>macam</malay> like history [lah] she got rape <malay>dia kena</malay> rape <malay>daripada</malay> uncle <malay>dia</malay>
when she was young then <malay>lepas tu</malay> when she grew up obviously <malay>dia macam</malay> loner <malay>bawa</malay> bloodshed rumah then <malay>lepas tu</malay> she I think she got suicidal thoughts [lah] she got self-harm so there were scars like
everywhere had her body her arms [ah] legs all that so when the beast saw it right then she say [oh] you're pure
but normal girls because she he kidnapped three girls K one of it pure than the other two <malay>mereka macam</malay> popular kind then is like [oh] <malay>kau tak</malay> pure
<malay>kau macam tak kisah gitu pasal orang</malay> something like that [ah]
no I thought of that too
but when they showed the scars of the girl who's like [oh] you're pure because in a way is like <malay>dia tahu rasa sakit kau tak tahu rasa sakit</malay> that's why <malay>aku rasa dia</malay> pure <malay>daripada kau</malay>
something like that [ah] this is what I interpret from the movie [ah]
something like that ya
it's very end it's actually a trilogy
the old movie is called (uh) shit I forget then the second [one] is split the third [one] is glass
glass they combine all the three [one]
