okay
dude
what's a super chat
[ah] okay
I mean like I guess
<malay>kirakan</malay>
people who work as influencers <malay>selalu macam gitu</malay> like think about it singaporean <malay>pun banyak</malay> influencer [pe] <malay>yang</malay> like they don't really do much like you know all the pretty chinese girls on Instagram
a lot of them are like they all look the same you know they kinda
they have the long black hair then they all they're all sponsored by like Shopee and
ya I don't know
that's true
[ah]
how much is fifteen thousand yen in
it's the same it's fifty thousand dollars
[oh]
Apex players
I mean I just think it's
fast paced I guess I used to play a lot of I started with um <malay>apa tu</malay>
(uh) I started with BlackShot then like I used to play my with friends in the computer lab when the teacher wasn't looking then we started playing BlackShot together then from then I started playing two like I got tell you before right I started playing two with my (uh) primary school guy friends cause we used to walk back from together then you know <malay>sama-sama</malay> right then when you get back home also we together we play like two together [lah] then we didn't study much but that's besides the point then (uh) I remember one time like he was teaching me how to
like do the controls and stuff then I was quite new to the game then he ask me come nearer then I'm like okay I'll come nearer then he said it'll come a bit nearer nearer nearer then I'm like okay I'll come a bit nearer then you know he taunt kill me which is basically like you you take like he like he pressed Q and then it makes your character do something cool and then it kills you so he stabbed an arrow up my body and then I flopped and a died ya
no no no no no ya but
basically
ya that's my experience I guess after that
did I I think
I stopped playing for a while [oh] no I also played Halo two at my friend's house a lot ya that was like cause you know I got primary school <malay>punya</malay> clique [kan] then <malay>kita</malay> used to go to his house like my friend's name is #hadziq# then we used to go to his house during the holidays then we would go there and we would play Halo two then how it works is that you know the screen then on top got the like player one then below got player two so it was a split screen then <malay>dah kecil</malay> [kan] then my like you can see the difference between people's proficiencies side by side then like I was running around trying to find my friend right cause I wanna shoot her then she was she was walking then she stop then she had to turn the other controller [eh] the other what do you call it joystick ya she had to turn the other joystick and then she walked then she stopped then she turned the joystick so she cause she couldn't like like like coordinate her hands or something so ya I ended up beating her a lot so
no it makes sense
it's pretty normal [lah] I think to be honest the only reason why my like
like he really he really <malay>suka macam</malay> game game [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> then he will always buy stuff like new games or like he'll put like emulators (uh) into his computer and stuff then you just attach the
controller ya then he would we would just play like Street Fighter [lah] or like Super Mario and stuff then he will lend me his game boy then I started playing Final Fantasy when I was like six but you know like at that age you don't even understand what's going on so I wasn't really good at Final Fantasy [lah] I didn't understand the strategy then like until this year also I don't like strategy games ya but then cause of that like I got used to the controls like from a early age I guess then on top of that I used to do sports like you know in primary school (uh) like I used to be from floorball ya you know cause I did ya you know I was team captain also like but that's just because the rest of the team didn't care but that's besides the point then
(err) I guess cause of all of that my hand eye coordination got
better like it's pretty good [ah] I don't know if it's still that good now I guess it's just I got used to it you know <malay>dah biasa</malay>
[oh] I I played I played COD like a long time ago cause it got boring it's just you refresh the round then after that you like shoot people and then it's like the same cycle ya so now I play PUBG ya with #riti# but I used to play PUBG in secondary school also it was (uh) like cause the other girls in class they didn't really play games then I was I was (uh)
one of the girls or like there was another girl also [lah] like I think #shahira# used to play games a lot also but basically she and I
would sometimes play with like the guys in class cause my classes
the ratio was really off it was like twenty girls ten guys or I think nineteen girls eleven boys something like that ya it's pretty bad then they will always play together then I also was interested [lah] then one time they <malay>ajak</malay> me then like like we started playing together then that's why they taught me how to play PUBG
but I felt kind of bad [lah] I was quite a team burden back then but that's just because (uh) I wasn't used to the game I think but it was really fun <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>selalunya selepas</malay> exam or <malay>selepas sekolah</malay> then <malay>kita</malay> just you know there's like convenience stores usually right ya then we would go there then <malay>kita makan sama-sama</malay> then after we finish like eating then we just play PUBG together [lor] it was nice it was like one of my favourite memories from ya ya it was damn [ah] it was really nice [lah] I like thinking about it
B ya
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya the Switch is sort of like a
combination of a lot of their own consoles they just kind of improved on the design <malay>sikit-sikit</malay>
Taken [oh] Taken is a pretty good game though I my brother had a then his he had like a bunch of games I'm not sure if they were pirated or not cause like he pirates a lot of stuff not even gonna lie like even my games on my were pirated I think ya but he had like ben ten and like some other few games but I don't I don't remember the rest ya but ya I really I really really like the just because it was so easy to bring around you know ya
basically more or less [ah]
then
[oh] shit
ya ya ya correct correct correct
funny story right I the first time I saw Mortal Kombat was when I was like
four four four or three it was I was super young then I went to (uh) my #makcik's# house <malay>siapa</malay> [eh]
my first sign of childhood trauma
but
I think so I think he's like the main character in one of them or is it all of them I don't even remember the plot to be honest
(mmhmm)
ya actually I stopped playing that Tetris game I think cause I got I got
bored of the loading screen cause like to wait for a new match is quite sometime right
quite long right ya so I think I stop playing that I was thinking about getting smashed
ya so I think I stopped playing that I was thinking of getting Smash also though like I don't know I didn't know if it would translate well onto the Switch Lite or not cause I know a lot of people would prefer to play it like on the screen then some more like <malay>kalau</malay>
your friends come over or something then you know you would want to play on the big screen together I guess so that's why I didn't get Smash ya I got Mario Odyssey instead ya and then I ordered (uh) Stardew Valley the one that's <malay>macam</malay> (uh) Harvest Moon ya but I ordered it like what two weeks ago or a week ago then the store hasn't contacted me I need to them on Facebook I think
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>aku beli kat</malay> (uh) you know
ya then <malay>dia orang ada</malay> website [pe] so I just searched up the game there then <malay>aku cari cari cari</malay> and I think <malay>kena</malay> like they have to ship it out from somewhere else then like <malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] like it takes awhile to ship stuff over to singapore but like two weeks is a bit of a long time then they never contact me then they said like I went onto the website yesterday in class then I was like (uh) searching if they had like any issues with the shipping cause of COVID right then (uh) apparently if the store doesn't contact I need to contact them either on Facebook [lor] I need to email then I don't know do you think it's better if I email or if I on Facebook
[kan] cause I think
if I send an email also maybe <malay>tak baca</malay> that's the thing right I ordered a day six album like in
march like it was the start of circuit breaker I think ya so like around march then it's the
days gone by <malay>punya</malay> era like the retro <malay>punya</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> order <malay>march</malay> [kan] then <malay>sekarang dah</malay>
like <malay>dah nak dekat</malay> november
I haven't gotten it at all they haven't even confirm no they confirmed my order already but then they never like updated me after that aku rasa dia orang terlupa</malay> like I really feel like they forgot about my order but then I like I really keep meaning to email them I always forget in fact I've already ordered another album and I already got that album but like I still don't have the previous album that I ordered
ya so I need to
email them about it cause now they have my thirty dollars
(uh) it's on Carousell but then like they're an official website they're they're not sketchy [lah] to be honest they're like quite well-known it's house of K-pop
ya but I don't think they meant to scam me [lah] I think they just genuinely forgot about it then (uh) I need to get a refund probably but I've already waiting so long then <malay>macam</malay> #paiseh# <malay>sikit</malay> to you know
like email them I guess I don't I don't even know what I should say what should I write in my email
ya they gave me the order number ya
(mm) I guess so
no no no the signed one got cancelled cause that time two members went on hiatus ya I didn't I ended up not buying that [one]
ya
that [one] I only got
I decided to buy two normal versions
ya then I just pre-ordered it [orh] ya
something
I know right it's so like you kind of question like what they actually do in the army and then like you know sometimes they get the idols to perform also inside the army it's quite entertaining though especially when they like come together [oh] it's super entertaining
ya ya ya I think so
I don't know maybe
maybe cause they have more people so it's more spread out I guess then maybe that's why they got more time to enjoy enjoy <malay>sikit</malay>
ya
I don't know it's very weird also it's very weird to think that like our friends are going to go to I have some people enlisting in like I have some friends enlisting in
january like even before my birthday [seh] then ya it's it's so early I mean it's good [lah] <malay>maknanya</malay> like they get to
(uh)
like
what is it they ya they get to get discharged earlier but still it's kinda sad then I can only see them on weekends ya
(mm) but my closest guy friends haven't gotten it yet though know like #set lin# hasn't
gotten it
ya ya ya maybe he'll get for april or something maybe that's why they haven't sent out I don't know I don't know how works
<malay>abeh kalau bukan</malay> april what's the on after that
I think I think I understand what the commando thing is because #set lin's# brother was like commando in ya in it's kind of ironic because they're not singaporean but you know as in like they weren't born in singapore ya ya they're burmese [oh] ya ya ya ya ya that's why his name is so weird #set lin# ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then (uh) if I'm not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when it's like going to be war [lah] like they're the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so that's why like when people do that's what that's that's usually what they think about [lor] it's like do I really want to risk my life for this certain role it's a good role like there's a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought [lah] like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know <malay>macam sedih</malay> [lah] to see to have your mother worry about you you know while they're back home ya then I remember at HeadRock
forgot his name one of the malay the one that
used to that you saw at Don Don Donki
do you do you know
[ah] ya ya ya him he and
#saz# were in what is it called [ah] infantry in or something ya then that [one] also is quite
I think it's it's like something like commando but I I don't know what's the difference [ah]
then you know #saz# also was like a medic sort of like he he he was really good at doing first aid and stuff then back then when we were doing part time he will explain to me like what to do with different people like for different injuries what you should do what
methods to apply or something ya infant is like the man
[orh] is it
I don't know I just watch war movies and I watch people die and I I don't really know the like the specifics
ya ya
malaysia <malay>tak tahu</malay> honestly <malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] thailand thailand <malay>dia orang macam</malay> draw lots [sia] I think I remember cause <malay>apa itu</malay> #bam bam# went to thailand back to thailand then he was or was it ten they were like sitting together then they were like waiting for it to happen then they just draw draw draw draw the lots then after that end up both of them don't need to go
when it happened it felt <malay>macam</malay> hunger games [seh] honestly like why don't you just drawing why why do you gather everyone there to draw lots like just do it like I don't know in an office then <malay>hantar</malay> letter <malay>kirakan</malay> like so
so <malay>pelik</malay> to have everyone there <malay>macam</malay>
then they don't have
I think
what I read about was that japan back then [lah] don't know if it's still like that now like in history um they really train on mental resilience and then like they would they really drive the nationalism into like the soldiers so that's why
like the
(uh) what do you call it the the one that the people that sacrificed themselves in the warplanes
I think so ya ya then like those pilots they were willing they knew that they were gonna die but they willingly volunteered themselves to like drive drive the plane into the ships ya like because they at the back of the heads they're like yes I would I would love to die for my country cause like for them it's like I think of honour I guess I think singaporean culture doesn't really have that but japanese people I think korean people also [ah] they are very strong about their honour then like that's even that's also why they taught soldiers how to commit #seppuku#
ya it's like you start from the right then you left then you go up then like your guts will literally spill out of you ya (uh) I remember after the war I think after certain battles [lah] if they lost right they would just commit #seppuku# and die
ya can you imagine that like
you are so devoted to your country to the point where you would rather die than just
ya than just lose the war it's it's quite intense
ya in general cause I watch so many war movies right war was just terrible man it was terrible for everyone and
a lot of people
I think the saddest parts are when
people die not even cause they were fighting but they were they just got like diseases and stuff I I was watching this story atonement ya then the guy (uh)
are you are you gonna watch the movie
okay well then the guy died of
septicaemia or something which is basically when like you have a wound then (uh) there's like bacteria and it infects your wound and then like basically you just
(um) I don't know [ah] it just
ya then because of that they just can't breathe or stuff or something ya
ya so he died like that and he died on the last like before the last ship back home
ya it it was really sad [lah] so when he died and then the wife not the wife but like the girlfriend I guess
(um) she died too but it was because of
no it was cause of a bombing and then she tried to hide in a train station but cause of the bombing I think it burst some pipe or something and then the whole train station got flooded
ya so that's how she died then so they both died before they met each other again
ya it was a really it was pretty sad [lah] but I didn't I didn't cry that much I think cause
that wasn't the main message of the story ya but it was pretty sad
[oh] <malay>yang</malay> (uh) grave of the fireflies
<malay>itu sedih gila</malay> [sia] no it's because <malay>macam</malay> it's
it's so realistic to the point where it's not it's not like you know you're not like watching a movie anymore it's like you're really there so that's why it really broke my heart
that's why and he was really trying his best to take care of the sister you know then it's just #suay# [ah] the sister ended up dying of malnutrition
[a'ah] [a'ah] [a'ah]
<malay>sedih</malay>
it's not even not even an entree
it happened in nineteen forty two-ish ya
(um) I think
my mother's generation is like one of the last few
to have experienced effects of the war
[a'ah]
my (uh) <malay>apa itu arwah nyai</malay> (uh) she came from indonesia then <malay>dia naik</malay>
<malay>aku ingat dulu</malay> [kan] it was like a big ship like a big ship then she just hopped on and then she rode to singapore but no she <malay>naik sampan sampan kecil dari</malay> indonesia <malay>jawa</malay> like she took that <malay>sampan</malay> all the way to singapore with like I don't know one like a few of my aunts and uncles my mum wasn't born yet my mum was born in singapore then she came all the way to singapore ya then like my <malay>arwah datuk</malay> was a security guard or something ya
then (um)
I think
she told me during the war like they the japanese would always like seek out very pretty girls ya so like she knew like her neighbours they would purposely <malay>macam apa</malay> [eh] (uh) mud ya they would take mud and then they would just rub it on their faces trying to make themselves look very very dirty cause they don't want to look like appear attractive to any of the japanese soldiers [lah] then that was quite scary then had to ration out food also that was the worst then you know my mother she used to I don't know [lah] like like they were really it was really really like they were really poor
then <malay>makan apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>cari dapat daun ke apa</malay> then <malay>ambil</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>makan</malay> [jer]
ya then she but they always tried to have <malay>lauk</malay> [lah] like (uh) even back then you know
(uh) like
in canteens or something people <malay>selalu makan nasi taruk kicap</malay> [kan] but
like even back then I don't know why [ah] but that family of theirs they never did that they at least have like one <malay>kuah</malay> to eat together ya cause I think
even though they were poor my <malay>arwah nyai</malay> didn't want them to feel poor you know like at least have something [lah] had something there to eat together then ration out [lor] as much as possible ya
serious it was it was a <malay>sampan kecil aku</malay> I swear I <malay>ingat</malay> I thought it was like gonna be a really big ship then I talked to my sister about it then she said you realise it was a <malay>sampan</malay> right like it wasn't a big ship then I was like !huh! how she fit inside the <malay>sampan</malay> then she said [oh] like the same way everyone else does [ah] you just squeeze together then just hope for the best [ah] then can you imagine how many days that would take from freaking indonesia all the way to singapore on a sampan with other people some more
and she did she barely took anything with her I think he just took like
some clothes then like her money [lor] then she just came to singapore I mean
I don't know I don't know how they got the house but ya
it was (mm)
before the war I think
it was ya it was like a year or two years before the war
then ya then she came to singapore I mean either way they would have gone they would have gone to indonesia anyway ya but it's okay [lah] if my <malay>arwah nyai</malay> didn't come to singapore in that <malay>sampan</malay> I would still be
<malay>jawa</malay> so
that's why I'm glad I'm not though ya
[ah] ya ya ya it's they they don't even like to acknowledge it [lah] to be honest and then they I think everyone knows already [lah] but like they put a lot of money into giving japan this new image and then like you know just showing off their culture and everything ya
but
but my mum a bit <malay>merepek</malay> [seh] like you know that time japan kena tsunami and like earthquake it was pretty bad right the
I think so the magnitude of nine or something ya then my mum was like [oh] this is
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
ya it's like karma for what they did during the japanese occupation
ya like I mean sure I guess whatever you believe in but it's still a bit insensitive to say it while it's happening
ya ya correct correct
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>macam tak kena</malay> [ah] [ah]
(mm) I was watching unsolved mysteries on netflix then they were talking about this one town there also got affected by the
(err) what do you call it the tsunami ya then um it washed away a lot of people basically and a lot of people that I think in that region alone fifteen thousand people died ya and it wasn't a big town it was maybe their population was
(mm) okay [ah] four hundred thousand but but still fifteen thousand out of that much is still quite a lot right then (um) there were a lot of people saying that they saw a lot of the spirits of the people who died ya but weren't like harmful [lah] they were more of like they were very lost like a lot of them said that like the <malay>hantu-hantu ini semua dia orang</malay>
like they didn't know where to go cause they didn't know that they died cause it was all so sudden right then especially taxi drivers whenever they were driving around right (err) like usually nighttime they will find people who are just like in the middle of nowhere then they need to go they want to go back into the town where the tsunami happen
then like
they will stop
near the town then when they turn back the person is not there anymore
ya
something like that it's it's I guess it's kind of a spin off version of buddhism not not to say it's like not to be disrespectful it's just that it's something like that ya
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah] [ah]
ya
[ah] ya it was in
in two thousand three ya ya
I
I may have watched a malay drama about it like this girl was a victim and then she moved like she became like I don't know [ah] she had foster parents or something then she grew up with them then you <malay>kahwin orang kaya</malay> or something I don't know but anyway cause of that I learnt more about the like the thing that happened ya it was really bad like it devastated
like the whole
I don't know how I don't know what you call it I guess town ya and after that a lot of people have like trauma of just even showering
you know cause of the water and then like <malay>kasihan</malay> [lah] cause
a lot of people lost their my parents their grandparents then you know like if even like you can't even retrieve
your
serious
like he got pulled in to the water ya then I think I don't know [ah] maybe the mother ran in after him a
ya but I know that I think they died ya
it's pretty sad [lah] that's why it's quite fortunate that we live in singapore like okay there are a lot of cons also but at least we don't we really are quite safe from
(uh) natural disasters
ya
I think <malay>belum</malay> [eh]
[ah]
that's so creepy
!eww!
there's like similar stories about this in the basically like they people move into new houses right then you know houses in the are freaking huge like if you watch renovation stories right dude their basements are the size of like a flat you know and that's just one floor and it's the bottom floor so their attics they also have like attics and stuff then got stories of people they just move in and then they hear like like I don't know [lah] footsteps around the house right then usually I think people would usually think like a ghost or something then but then they they wouldn't believe it [lah] so they think [oh] maybe just the pipes or something but then people find out that there are like people living in their attics and when they're not awake or something they'll go down and then they'll eat from their fridge or something then they'll go back up into the attic to hide ya then I remember one girl she was showering or something then she heard the person climb down ya then I don't know [ah] I don't know how it happened but she managed to call the police then the police arrested the guy
ya then I think the guy was living in her attic for what [ah] year ya a year since she moved in and she didn't notice at all like that's so creepy I cannot imagine having just this random person
in your house like don't don't even know what he's doing
actually ya actually ya ya ya ya ya but in a more
ya less (um) #murdery# kind of way
it's so insane I cannot stand away you can do you know what what higher speed said I cannot sit cross country and no [lah] I mean
I don't know [lah] I mean
(mm) I guess has to do with like their amendments and stuff ya
(mm)
ya I can't imagine people our age voting a lot of people I know didn't even keep up with the
like parties and stuff ya I mean it's not bad [lah] it's just that it's not necessary you know I think it will only work in
countries like america I kings or like okay [lah] maybe it will only work for work in favour for her talent like other workers party basically any party that's not P P
I guess or like okay [lah] maybe it will only work for work in favour for the I don't know worker's party basically any party that's not
cause
(mm)
ya (uh) for I read somewhere I think on reddit (uh) <malay>ada orang kata bila dia tinggal kat zone</malay>
I think
then they moved to a zone
that was under
was it a worker's party or another party [lah] like you can tell that the residents residences are different like the way they are decorated [ah] like it's very different and then I think it's like the one
under had more amenities or something ya or it was decorated nicer [lah] but at the same time it's also because has a lot of financial backing cause since they're the super majority so it's kind of like a grey area of like maybe they do want to do a lot more but they just don't have the means you know then it's kind of like I don't have the means to show you but I can show you I can't and at the same time you know (mm) politics <malay>macam</malay> confusing ya
(mm)
true
I don't know I mean my friend is taking political science now so by the time I can vote I'm just I'm just gonna ask everything then I'll follow her her guidance we live in the same also like she lives what
two blocks away from me ya so I'm just gonna trust her instinct
it is it is ya actually got her she did she got her first essay back already she did really well she most people she said most people only got a B for that paper then she got then only three people like their professor gave an A then she got an A minus then she was so happy I'm so proud of her
I think it was about karl marx and just his communism idea ya
ya no really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had to write a whole essay about it like two thousand words
ya
[ah] but nah uni sounds so exciting can't wait to do stuff like that
dude I cannot believe it and she's like the one of the youngest [ah] ya
I don't know why she went to when she could have gone overseas though I guess why she just wants to be back here since she was overseas for a while ya but her friends from her international school <malay>ada yang pergi</malay> (uh) <malay>mana</malay>
like some went to (uh) most of them went to [ah] like some into ireland like #dublin# ya then some of them went to australia some of them went to the ya
ya international school [lah] so they're <malay>kaya gila</malay> <malay>lagipun</malay> we were supposed to go overseas
<malay>tiga kali</malay> [seh] supposed to go overseas bangkok <malay>tak jadi</malay> then malaysia <malay>tak jadi</malay> then japan <malay>pun tak jadi</malay>
I think <malay>yang paling</malay> heart pain was that we couldn't see the #tokyo# olympics cause we were supposed to if we could have gone this year then like okay [lah] <malay>memang kita boleh pergi</malay> japan any other year but the problem is that we can't always go when the olympics are happening you know and then <malay>dah</malay> [lah] like how do we how do you even get tickets to go to the olympics
[ah] ya
ya exactly like you can't even guarantee that you'll get into the olympics
like (ugh)
ya
ya
(ugh) it's just wasted [lah]
<malay>aku pun</malay> I mean like I was willing to settle for <malay>kita</malay> just stay in malaysia overnight [seh] or like for a few nights then to <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> literally a week before we went lucky I asked if we could get a refund or not just in case
ya
<malay>sedih gila</malay> it wasn't even just border <malay>tutup</malay> [seh] border <malay>tutup</malay> then circuit breaker !fuh! <malay>terus</malay> my my mood just plummeted
(mm)
[kan]
it feels like
we didn't do much this year actually we didn't but like ya I cried so much this year I don't know why too much too much happen up here but not like physically ya
then next year internship <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>mampus</malay>
