hi
hello how are you
okay okay
okay beauty in everyone
(mm)
(uh huh)
okay okay
(uh) definition of beauty [eh] okay
(uh) personally I think I don't have any good looks
so beauty to me I would define it as personality and manners <malay>adab</malay> [lah] <malay>adab</malay>
what about you like what's your definition of beauty
(mm)
(mm) insecurities
(mm)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) okay look before <malay>kita</malay> start [kan] (um)
okay like for you do you think beauty
(uh) okay <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] (um)
beauty in the long term would you ya would you for example would you friend someone who is okay because for beauty some people define it as good looks but then good looks to me (uh) I I see as a short term thing
so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana</malay>
ten years down the road <malay>bila kita dah</malay> ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
ya ya ya
ya okay so my question is like do you think (um)
(um) <malay>macam</malay> for example friendship [lah] <malay>macam kita nak buat kawan baru</malay> [kan]
would you would you go for that beauty in the short term basis or a long term basis
(um)
okay
(mmhmm)
true true true
attention ya
(mmhmm)
(um) true true
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(err) <malay>tahu tahu</malay>
#inshaallah# <malay>tak</malay>
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm) like
true true true
okay (uh)
okay okay <malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] because <malay>poli poli aku</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what I can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (um) define
(uh) for my course okay because my course
my course <malay>banyak</malay> cliques [tau] then (um) in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation [kan] so <malay>macam apa aku</malay> observe [kan]
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is <malay>dia orang</malay> popular and then they are
they are very loud
ya they are very vocal [lah] then and they have good looks also so
<malay>macam</malay> for me (uh) in my course most of the cliques <malay>yang macam</malay> the big cliques right they tend to I mean they are closer to people (um) they
they are closer to people that <malay>macam ada</malay> good looks <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>macam</malay>
ya fashion wise also [ah]
yes
(mm)
(mmhmm) ya
ya
(mm)
ya true
(um) ya true
so it's very very subjective [lah] in terms of <malay>macam mana dia orang</malay> select (uh) friends and ya and how the friendship last till
ten years down the road ya
(mm) true true
yes
competition
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
(um) okay
(uh) for working life [eh]
I think
it's subjective also because if you were to join in in the beauty industry then I think like good looks is the first ya like first priority that they will look into then followed by talent
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so <malay>macam</malay> teaching <malay>ke</malay> (uh)
ya design <malay>ke ataupun</malay> like social service ya F&B also then I think what is for me if I want to be an employer then I would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
to how willing is the person to work in my company
and then beauty is like
it depends beauty <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know like I don't really place any priority in beauty
ya (mmhmm)
(err) yes yes
ya ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(um)
beauty in appearance or mindset personality wise
(uh)
okay like I think it's natural for humans to like
the first the first glance ya yes yes yes
but I think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain (uh) like <malay>macam</malay> for example for female right they like males <malay>macam</malay>
the <malay>lelaki yang ada</malay> certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
(err) yes
okay so for me appearance or mindset in a partner
<malay>aku rasa macam</malay> are we talking in like first first
first time impression or
[ah] okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh) I think will be mindset slash personality wise
(um) like <malay>kau nak</malay> share
(uh) okay okay
okay (uh) okay <malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> if I want to find a partner
then I would say beauty in their personality and mindset <malay>sebab macam</malay>
(uh) for me I place I I put more I mean <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] my first first
how do you say it <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) for me to identify that person as my partner in the future I would (uh) my first check list is like mindset or personality so <malay>macam</malay> ya because <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>apa kita macam</malay>
we are into only the good looks then like I said <malay>macam</malay> in <malay>apa</malay> ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so <malay>macam</malay> to me I will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> mindset and personality so <malay>macam</malay> personality and mindset is something that your bring (uh) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] it's like since <malay>yang kau dah ada</malay> personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset (um) like
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] what (uh) your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods (uh) rather than your looks because for me I emphasize on the personality <malay>macam</malay> like for example ten years down the road [kan] <malay>kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita</malay> when you have your children then like if you
don't have good personality or mindset then
ya like what's the point of the marriage ya
(um) intelligence
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(err) you groom yourself [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay (uh) firstly <malay>memang aku ada watak</malay> a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly <malay>macam</malay>
if we if you were to put me in a room where there's a lot of like pretty pretty like girls and or or we we are we like the most most like insecure person [lah]
ya that
(uh) <malay>memang</malay> high <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>dia lebih lawa</malay> [lah] [ah]

(mm)
ya okay the
(uh)

before we go to the next question I want to ask <malay>macam</malay>
okay okay best <malay>ke dalam</malay> topic of friendship [kan]
<malay>macam kau rasa</malay>
friendship <malay>bila kita buat kawan</malay> (uh) <malay>buat</malay>
<malay>buat kawan</malay> for the first time
do you think girls or boys place more importance on the good looks
when making friends for the first time
(mm)
(mm)
subjective [lah] also
(mm)
(mm)
to me (uh) in terms of boys or girls I would say girls <malay>sebab macam</malay>
I don't know whether boys I mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like <malay>macam</malay> their
practical they're quite practical
<malay>macam</malay> the friendship is base more on <malay>macam</malay>
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly <malay>macam</malay> I mean
not to generalize [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like boys they generally talk about like
(uh) <malay>apa macam</malay> like topics that are not so emotionally involved I would say ya

(mmhmm) yes
(mm) actually for that topic <malay>aku pernah</malay> [lah] <malay>belajar</malay> [lah] in <malay>aku punya</malay> course if like
(uh) if there's a term
(uh) if I'm not wrong the term is dysfunctional (um)
ya dysfunctional (um) (um) ya so it's basically like the society is not
<malay>macam</malay> what we think is a society it's not like (um) good but then it's still functioning so
(uh) it's it's rather it's rather to have that society like even though the (uh) beauty standards or the socioeconomic status is not
<malay>macam</malay> is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional it's it's called something functional something [lah]
rather than to have a society that <malay>macam</malay> everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of <malay>macam</malay> they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya

<malay>lain macam</malay> extra
(mm)
okay (err) then our us okay about the fashion thingy right
(uh)
okay so now
let's move on to the fashion side so ya okay so for fashion like
okay so for fashion (um) back in those days <malay>macam</malay> nineties eighties [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> the fashion do (um) I'm not really sure because I don't live in that era but like the fashion (mm)
(err) yes based on pictures also [lah] then yes it's very laid back and <malay>macam</malay>
like I'm I'm not sure whether it's true <malay>tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan</malay> <malay>dengan</malay> the fashion trend you know so <malay>macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut</malay> and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now <malay>macam</malay>
we have like the (uh) what the term E-boy E-girl then the (uh) then the what type of new dress <malay>macam</malay> hipster hipster so <malay>macam</malay>
I know you know I'm
(mm) hipster
ya just to fit in I would say
(mm) so <malay>macam</malay>
like do you think the
the no (um) the fashion <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
<malay>macam</malay> is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so <malay>macam</malay> do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
okay okay can can can
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] yes social media
(mmhmm)

[oh] I know I know (err) if you want to go [eh] if you want to go far you go by yourself something like that ya
(mm) yes true
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
rethink
okay so (uh) okay this might be out of topic but
you were mentioning about like (um) like okay it's not really related to what you said but I think there is some relevance but you (um)
<malay>apa tu macam</malay> (um) right now (uh)
they society sees one sees an individual who is always alone
as someone who is below below societies (um)
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (uh) so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is <malay>macam kau ada banyak kawan</malay> then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is (um) <malay>ada ada</malay> (uh) <malay>ada</malay> value [lah] then <malay>ada macam ada tempat dekat</malay> society but someone <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>dia macam apa seorang</malay>
then <malay>dia macam pentingkan</malay> not really <malay>pentingkan diri</malay> as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care [lah] so like what what you think of like (um) this society standard <malay>macam</malay> ya
like being in a big group is deem as (uh) your offer value rather (uh) offer value and then for someone who is who is (um)
who is individual who is alone
(uh) seems (uh) society deems them as (uh) the weaks (err) yes the weak ones
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(um) ya
[oh]
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
(mm)
(mm) ya
yes yes
yes ya
(mm) yes yes
(mm)
yes commitment
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
true true true
(um) okay personally because I am an introvert so it will take me very long time it will take me very long time to open up to new people [lah] especially so
our first friendship is yes yes yes
it will take a lot of years right
ya
that was <malay>jodoh</malay> [seh]
(mm)
we friends or what
seven no six set to I think you know two thousand fourteen
we <malay>ngam-ngam</malay>
it has been
roughly six years [kan]
ya
ya no beauty no standards
ya
ya
true true
(mm)
and I think for our friendship also (um) we are not that judgmental like in (uh) between ourselves so <malay>macam</malay>
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and <malay>kita macam banyak</malay> advice each other so so like it's really something
ya (mm)
true okay
ya friendship ya
okay should we move on to the next question
okay (uh) okay so we have this task like
the negative side there's (uh) society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself [lah] since beauty was so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada okay (uh) <malay>ada kebaikan dalam kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung</malay>
it could !aiya!
(mm)
they got the face and the attitude right
(mm)
yes #mira filzah#
(mm)
yes yes
[oh] ya
(mm)
(mm) so it's like full package [lah] <malay>macam</malay> good looking very humble also
but
but I heard okay so that one is (um) <malay>macam kita kirakan macam</malay> (uh) role model <malay>yang macam</malay>
someone who is (err) so <malay>macam mira filzah dia macam</malay> actress [kan]
western [eh] (uh) <malay>aku tak berapa tengok</malay>
(uh)
western actor or actress
(mm)
yes yes
(um) mostly character
ya
ya
yes yes
(mm) okay then for <malay>ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam</malay> (uh) <malay>pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam</malay> in your own
<malay>macam</malay> those not as
those not popular [lah] so <malay>macam kawan kau</malay>
<malay>ke</malay> or like someone
you like within your family I don't know
(mm) like who who is like
a role model to you obviously
<malay>yang macam dia lawa</malay> and very like <malay>lemah lembut</malay> and all
(mm)
(mm)
(err) ya
#neelofa# isn't #neelofa# like malaysian
[oh] yes yes
(mm) yes
(mm)
(mm)
yes
it's something <malay>macam</malay>
ya it's something also like I think youth nowadays
motivation [lah] yes
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> (uh) [kan] <malay>cakap pasal</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
deen and deen and dunya so <malay>macam apa tu</malay> dunya means like world [lah] so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dunia tak di akhirat</malay> [lah] so
(mm)
so <malay>macam aku rasa macam sekarang</malay> like <malay>budak</malay> I mean not to generalize okay but like <malay>budak-budak sekarang</malay> is more
ya like now more of like world
<malay>aku rasa macam sebab macam</malay> singapore [kan] <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world [lah] instead of like the the (uh) afterlife
(mm) so like I
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those <malay>yang macam dia ada dua</malay> [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> dunya and deen
yes
(mm)
(mm)
(oo)
yes
yes yes
(mm) true true
(mm)
so like more <malay>macam</malay> be comfortable in your own skin
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya sure okay so <malay>kita tinggal</malay> like a few more minutes [lah] so like I would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
so like about beauty you want to share first
regret [eh] [oh] okay
(mm)
okay so <malay>aku</malay> start first [lah] so regret <malay>aku</malay> is to be the beauty standard so <malay>macam dulu</malay> (uh) secondary one primary six <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> very (uh) very insecure [lah] <malay>sebab macam</malay>
<malay>kita ada</malay> influence <malay>dengan</malay> K pop <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>macam kita nampak</malay> !woo! <malay>macam lawa</malay> [seh] and <malay>kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua</malay> I mean <malay>kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam</malay> (uh) we are not there [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> ya so like what I regret was like (uh)
like <malay>aku terlalu pentingkan</malay> like <malay>kecantikan dari luar</malay> instead of <malay>dari dalam</malay> ya
(mm) so what's your regret
[oh]
I think it'll be conflict or selfish [lah]
[oh] yes
true true true
(um) then <malay>jap</malay>
ya
like I think message something like to to remind you during your <malay>apa macam</malay> (uh) <malay>bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat</malay> [lah] I would say
so (uh) for me five years ten years down the road
(um) the priority will be (uh) <malay>ke</malay> (uh) work live and
I think pressure in terms of like <malay>macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam</malay> marriage [lah] so I think
(uh) my message to be (um)
I think the pressure will be more <malay>bila kawan-kawan kau dah</malay> start to slowly get married so <malay>macam</malay> you'll feel very pressured so (um) my message would be (um)
to to emphasize to place the emphasis on your own life and and what you are you want to achieve in this world and the world after instead of looking what and not be influenced heavily by your surroundings so
it's really it's really what
your heart and your what what you really want [lah] instead of doing something that the the people around you
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause <malay>macam</malay> to to to learn to prioritise
yourself and be more selfish like easy ya
(mm)
so ya
ellen degeneres
(mm) true true
