and we can you imagine you <malay>tengah hantar makanan orang tengah tunggu</malay> at the house waiting where is my food !alamak! then find out the the rider bicycle <malay>pancit</malay> or the wheel
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[ah] <malay>pecah ke apa</malay> then like quite wasted [lah] if you buy a cheap very cheap kind of bicycle
[oh] ya [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> drivers <malay>kalau nampak orang</malay> bicycle they will try to try to <malay>apa tu</malay> drive very near to the bicycle ya [lah] I mean I know that you all want to rush for more orders means more money but then sometimes <malay>terlupa</malay> that [eh] you guys are on the road
and there are buses <malay>ada apa tu</malay> lorry <malay>ada</malay> motorcycles <malay>semua</malay> so next time just be more careful [lah] <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] before you <malay>pusing</malay> you <malay>tengok apa apa tu</malay> blind spot check back check back [eh] check back whether there any vehicles around you [ah]
okay okay then you <malay>tadi</malay> morning you told me you were taking your motorbike practical also right <malay>kat</malay> where again <malay>kat mana</malay> the #ubi# #ubi# #eunos# there right is it
[ah] so you <malay>macam tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia punya</malay> dangers and stuff
so next time when you [dah] <malay>dapat</malay> license your motorbike licence <malay>ke</malay> car license or lorry license so next time you know especially when you see [eh] got one cyclist coming or [eh] got one cyclists behind me you know [lah] to be more careful
[eh] wait wait that means you on which practical five [eh] <malay>lima</malay>
[ah] okay okay okay before [oh] ya prac five <malay>yang</malay> you have to do everything in the circuit then <malay>kalau</malay> pass prac six then only can go out at the road
(uh) okay <malay>tapi</malay> one thing about #ubi# [eh] cause I took my license there at #ubi# also
that <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] when I when I took my license <malay>apa tu</malay> #ubi# [ah] very crowded so you just be very careful [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> especially when you first time <malay>keluar naik</malay> road
there's a lot of lorries also so listen to what the instructors are telling you [lah] so ya
yes yes #ubi#
because I know some of my <malay>kawan</malay> they took the license motorbike licence <malay>kat</malay>
the one <malay>yang kat</malay> the one <malay>yang kat mana</malay> woodlands woodlands ya I know they told me that the area there <malay>sunyi</malay> [ah] quiet like not as many vehicles not as crowded <malay>macam kat</malay> #ubi# so I think for them was <malay>macam lagi senang</malay> to pass the test [lah] test
[oh] you
you <malay>naik basikal</malay> to #ubi#
[oh] you <malay>tak ambil</malay> public transport
[orh] okay okay okay then for you <malay>kalau dari</malay> #hougang# want to cycle to woodlands <malay>itu dah penat</malay> bro
by the time you want to start your lesson at woodlands you already <malay>penat</malay> you cannot really ride the motorbike motorbike ride you I think I don't know whether motorbike would go then later you <malay>kena</malay> scolding from all instructors
<malay>tapi</malay> I think one practical how much is it now
<malay>dua puluh</malay> [eh] <malay>dua puluh lebih</malay>
[oh] yes yes as you I think as you <malay>naik naik</malay> (uh) as you progress the cost of course [lah] <malay>dah lagi</malay> more <malay>mahal</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you go out on the road I think one instructor the ratio one instructor is to five
six or five riders I think that that's <malay>lagi</malay> more <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] as you go along this
course
but when do you think you will get your license though <malay>boleh beli</malay> motorbike <malay>boleh naik</malay> motorbike no need to ride your bicycle
<malay>lagi</malay> that day <malay>yang kat</malay> [ah] news north west line the major [ah] blackout !alamak! <malay>itu dia orang</malay> during <malay>bila</malay> peak period and then the red line the green line <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> yellow line <malay>sekali</malay> breakdown
ya but [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> when you when you [dah] pass [eh] which I hope you do pass soon which motorbike you looking for yamaha suzuki
one five zero <malay>itu</malay> [kan] the tuning training centre <malay>punya</malay> motorbike [eh] <malay>tak</malay>
[oh] you can get cause I know my friends <malay>yang sekarang tengah pakai</malay> they say it's (err) fuel efficient <malay>dapat jimat duit sikit</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>atau kalau</malay> you <malay>banyak duit sangat</malay> [kan] you <malay>boleh beli</malay> those (err) more expensive motorbike <malay>yang macam</malay> triumph
is it pronounced triumph T R I U M P H I think so [lah] I'm not too sure myself
triumph or [ah] the one I <malay>paling suka</malay> when I see people riding on the motorbike (uh) royal enfield
[oh] but you don't want to buy a first hand <malay>punya</malay> motorbike [eh]
!wah! and then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tak ada</malay> here for six months then who going to use your bike cause you need to always someone needs to start start your motorbike right you cannot leave it (err) sleeping for too long period
but I mean the transport transports <malay>sekarang tak boleh</malay> reliable <malay>sangat</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I would say that the transport has he has been getting better [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> I think a few years back three or four years back <malay>ada</malay> this one period of time macam</malay> every week confirm plus chop <malay>ada</malay> breakdown every week confirm <malay>ada</malay>
waiting time either too long [lah] or the
breakdown [lah] <malay>ada yang</malay>
(err) the
the travelling time was too long <malay>ada</malay> [jer] problem <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> but I would say now is much better [lah] they're doing a much better job but but having said that <malay>masih boleh</malay> improve that they can still improve so that's my take
[oh] ya true true fair enough you wanted to ask me one question right just now
[oh] like what was the best surprise [lah] I've ever received yes [ah] okay okay
the best surprise [eh] <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>paling dapat</malay> (uh)
<malay>ini</malay> many years ago [lah] [eh] many many years ago when a for my twenty first birthday <malay>selamat hari jadi</malay> [eh] my twenty first birthday [ah] my <malay>kawan-kawan kaki bola</malay> my soccer mates want to throw me a birthday
ya so I remember that time <malay>masih masih bulan ramadan</malay> that time when we were still fasting and then my birthday fell within that month [lah]
so they told me one of my teammate told me to
told me that they will be bringing me out for a birthday dinner
then (err) they chose this place <malay>namanya</malay> is called mark's place the one at #eunos# they wanted to <malay>belanja</malay> me dinner then okay I was like okay sure [ah] then I went down
they book the table for seven so <malay>senang</malay> [lah] <malay>bila</malay> time <malay>buka</malay> we all <malay>boleh makan</malay> together right
so I came down I was so excited [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [eh] I went there at about <malay>pukul berapa</malay> [eh] I went six thirty so I sat there and I was the first to come I was the first to arrive so okay I <malay>duduk</malay> I <malay>duduk</malay> there at the table
then I <malay>duduk</malay> I <malay>tunggu tunggu tunggu</malay> for my friends nobody turn up <malay>tak ada orang datang</malay>
so I just wait and wait and wait and then the next thing I know <malay>ada</malay> because the place where I <malay>tengah duduk</malay> (uh) is facing the road
so I saw this one <malay>kereta</malay> just drive past <malay>tapi nampak ni kereta macam pernah nampak</malay> [jer] this <malay>kereta</malay> then I noticed <malay>dia punya</malay> driver was my one of my teammates so I was like okay okay maybe they already arrived so I'll just continue sitting down so
the driver and two of my other teammates came out
and then when they came and approach me they said that
[oh] by the way <malay>kita tak makan kat sini</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> them they <malay>tengok</malay> me and then I still remember other tables
of guys around my table they also turn and look like why am I sitting alone in a table in a big round table for about ten people but I was the only one sitting there then my friends will like
they went to put a blindfold around me and then I was like <malay>terkejut sikit</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>asal tiba-tiba</malay> want to blindfold me right so they blindfold me and then they they put me in the car
then (err) so they blindfolded me so when I <malay>masuk</malay> the <malay>kereta</malay> I didn't know who is inside I don't know what was inside the car so you just tell me <malay>diam-diam</malay> and then just sit in the car they will drive me to a unknown location [lah] location <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>sendiri tak tahu</malay> so
but then I think the duration on the car trip was about twenty minutes I could hear like they went to make some pit stops because I can hear the the <malay>dia punya pintu</malay>
I can hear the <malay>pintu buka</malay> but when the <malay>pintu buka</malay> also I I cannot remove my blindfold okay then after that I
I felt like the car [dah] park and then my <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> say okay now you can (uh) get off the car so of course <malay>ada orang pimpin</malay> my <malay>tangan</malay> cause I already blindfolded I cannot just walk right I might fall into <malay>longkang</malay> or something
[ah] okay then I just <malay>ikut</malay> I just <malay>pimpin</malay> my friend <malay>tangan</malay> they brought me to a unknown location [ah] next thing I know when I open my blindfold I was at marina barrage heated gang marina barrage
<malay>kita kat</malay> marina barrage
ya [oh] if I remember correctly <malay>tak salah</malay> there were about
seven to eight more of my soccer teammates who were there and they they were sweet they <malay>letak</malay> (uh) picnic mat they <malay>letak</malay> (uh) fairy lights and they prepared some <malay>makanan</malay> like pizza which was good because I was hungry by then and
just to remind everyone that we were (err) <malay>tengah puasa</malay> time <malay>tengah puasa</malay> I was very hungry and then they prepared some food and drinks <malay>ada bawa</malay> (uh) game cards so that we could play and then we played some music and nice [lah] like people celebrate your twenty first birthday
<malay>yang paling</malay> best (uh) <malay>lepas kita dah makan dah</malay> sing song (uh) <malay>perut dah kenyang</malay> and then (err) one of them pass me a birthday present
and <malay>nasib</malay> is the birthday present that I have been wanting for quite some time it was a <malay>kasut</malay> nike like this specific <malay>kasut yang</malay>
was quite <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this <malay>kasut</malay> that I think was about <malay>dua ratus lebih</malay> this pair of nike shoes
so (uh) of course I was even more happy [lah] that you got like the birthday present I wanted but having said that
ya no okay ya I was very happy when I got the present
and honestly when if I were to buy a present for somebody I will <malay>tanya</malay> the person first like [oh] <malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you want a teddy bear <malay>ke</malay> you want
you want if motorbike cannot [lah] I not that <malay>kaya</malay> so I cannot buy for you a motorbike but if you want a storybook or a backpack <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] if you your birthday present what do you want
ya at that point in time <malay>bila aku dalam kereta macam</malay> [eh]
<malay>takkan</malay> they want to kidnap me <malay>takkan</malay> they want to <malay>hantar</malay> me to #johor bahru# or put me in a abandoned house or something <malay>ada</malay> [lah] there was a period of time I was like <malay>asal kereta ni macam</malay> suddenly so quiet [eh] like where is everybody in the car or suddenly they abandoned the car then I'm sitting there alone in the car not knowing what's happening
so but I trusted them I mean they are my <malay>apa ke tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kawan-kawan kaki bola</malay> so that ended well and I think the thing about a presents [eh]
because sometimes I don't want to <malay>belikan orang tu</malay> a present that they might not want or <malay>atau</malay> present like they won't use so either I will ask them personally like [oh] okay what do you want for your birthday [lah] or it's either I buy for them (uh)
vouchers like it can be <malay>macam</malay> adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vouchers can be nike vouchers [ah] <malay>pergilah kau apa kau nak beli</malay>
I know <malay>kalau kalau perempuan dia orang selalu cakap lagi senang pasal</malay> can buy (err) gift card from sephora especially like sephora or you can buy from victoria secrets usually [lah] girls I think <malay>lagi senang</malay> to to buy presents for compared to a guy
anything
but I know one thing at least [ah] my friends my kawan kaki bola yang</malay> celebrated my birthday with me [ah] they actually
took my suggestions I I wouldn't even call it suggestions actually I said that I <malay>tak suka kalau macam</malay>
(uh) big (uh) birthday bash <malay>macam ada orang</malay> [kan] they especially <malay>kalau</malay>
twenty one birthday they will have their <malay>macam nak</malay> glamour glamour have it at the chalet where they where they will invite <malay>macam kawan dia nenek dia</malay> cousin <malay>dia abeh nanti banyak sangat orang</malay> like I <malay>tak suka</malay> that kind of stuff [lah]
I prefer those kind of like intimate stuff where I can spend times with my friends and family that I'm really really
<malay>kawan-kawan rapat</malay> [lah] so is good thing that they didn't throw a big (uh) big surprise at a chalet or hotel so I do you like <malay>kalau</malay> anybody do like a big grand gesture like that
that's why that's the thing
and also <malay>kalau macam banyak sangat orang</malay> especially <malay>kalau</malay> invite <malay>banyak sangat orang abeh orang yang</malay> you <malay>tak kenal atau orang yang</malay> that you barely talk to so you <malay>macam tak nak</malay> awkward [lah] then <malay>kalau banyak sangat orang</malay> also later you have to
you have to split your time with (err) different people and then I mean you cannot cut yourself into half right so you will have to speak with this group of people for like five ten minutes and then you <malay>kena</malay> go to entertain another group then you you'll be busy just entertain people actually
instead of having <malay>macam</malay> a very good time and <malay>macam</malay> #shiok# <malay>sendiri</malay>
and I so I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> like you want to have a this <malay>macam</malay> grand gestures right you need to <malay>kena fikir</malay> where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until <malay>macam sakit kepala</malay> [lah] you have to think
about venue and then you have to book in advance <malay>kalau</malay> you want to do like
<malay>tempat mahal-mahal macam</malay> hotel you have to book maybe a few months in advance
maybe and aside from venue also you <malay>kena</malay> book
[ah] <malay>makanan</malay> I mean come on I mean when you invite people you don't want them to come there and then there's like nothing to eat anyway we're all singaporeans right so we we love our food so we need think about venue <malay>nak kena fikir pasal</malay> (uh) <malay>makanan</malay>
and then you have to send out invitation then you have to you if you want to have some entertainment then you have to <malay>fikir</malay> [oh] what entertainment do you want I mean <malay>kalau</malay> you have someone else who is doing the planning and stuff okay [lah] then you can like <malay>lepak</malay> don't have to
think about anything but then again
if you gonna <malay>dapat orang</malay> birthday planner or something like that then you <malay>kena bayar</malay> this birthday planner <malay>pakai duit lagi</malay>
[oh] ya I mean like quite true [eh] <malay>tadi</malay> you <malay>cakap pasal</malay> if your birthday on <malay>macam</malay> twenty fifth december <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>macam</malay> your birthday is on (err)
thirty first december where's the peak period <malay>macam banyak orang</malay> confirm <malay>nak nak</malay> book (err) <malay>tempat macam</malay> want to book the hotels <malay>dekat dekat dengan</malay> the floating platform so they can probably see like the fireworks and stuff
so that one will be even harder [lah] I would say or even if your birthday falls (uh) during national day parade I'm pretty sure it will be quite difficult quite difficult and <malay>susah</malay> to <malay>dapat</malay> all this (uh) bookings and stuff
and also <malay>kalau macam</malay> some people <malay>macam tak nak</malay> celebrate <malay>dia punya</malay> birthday <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>nak pergi</malay> overseas <malay>ke apa nak pergi</malay> #batam#
or let's say somewhere even further like you want to go poland or something to go and celebrate your birthday <malay>itu lagi mahal kau nak kena beli apa tu</malay> plane tickets <malay>semua tapi sekarang bila</malay> time <malay>macam gini</malay>
nobody saw it coming <malay>macam</malay> time COVID you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more <malay>gerek</malay> [lah] if you can celebrate your birthday in #bali# or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more <malay>gerek</malay> [sia]
like I think for me <malay>kalau</malay> if I can choose [eh] where I want to spend my birthday I want to go where's that <malay>tempat banyak</malay> sheeps [ah] new zealand
like honestly if I can if I can choose a place to celebrate my birthday or to choose a <malay>tempat</malay> for me to go holiday that would definitely been using you can go to the countryside <malay>boleh apa tu</malay> feed the animals you can play with the animals I mean come on man in singapore
we barely see any sheeps you barely see any
(err) <malay>kambing</malay> so at least when you go places like new zealand especially <malay>dia punya</malay> countryside you get to see all this kind of animals and you get to do a lot of (uh)
natural activities like <malay>apa tu yang kat</malay> river the water rafting you can go hiking you can see
(uh) nice nice mountains and of course <malay>dia punya cuaca</malay> also <malay>lain lain</malay> from singapore singapore is always hot either hot or wet so at least there in new zealand if you can go during the winter times <malay>dapat juga</malay> some snow you <malay>pernah pergi</malay> new zealand [eh]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> (uh) japan japan <malay>nak cari</malay>
halal food also was quite difficult I remember that time when I went with my family we went to go japan or we wanted to look for halal food <malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>susah</malay> and
it was not readily available so you have to do your <malay>macam</malay> homework [lah] before you go you must probably want to bookmark the places where you want to <malay>makan</malay> halal food
because it's not like singapore where your halal food <malay>boleh dapat</malay> at food court you can <malay>dapat</malay> your halal food at a hawker centres which are all <malay>semua dekat dekat boleh jalan</malay> so there the
their are halal food [ah] is different different locations and you have to go and find it in <malay>orang jepun</malay> they don't really speak english so <malay>kalau nak berbual</malay> you probably have to use [ah] the app google translate to help you out
to find your places that you want to go [lah]
[oh] the place I went <malay>mana</malay> [eh] I went to their
(uh) #tokyo# so #tokyo# was #tokyo# honestly <malay>dia macam</malay> singapore [lah] <malay>macam banyak sangat orang</malay> it's very crowded it's a very urbanized so if there's other parts of <malay>jepun</malay> that I would like to visit (err) I will go further up north
(err) <malay>pergi</malay> #hokkaido# I think #hokkaido# also <malay>lagi tempat dia</malay> will be more <malay>sejuk</malay> and I think the food will be even nicer as well
have to been to <malay>pernah pergi tak</malay> #hokkaido#
so I think <malay>kalau</malay> if you don't want to go <malay>jepun</malay> another place that I <malay>pernah pergi</malay> also (err) south korea like at least south korea you know [lah] people there <malay>dia punya</malay> complexion <malay>semua cantik-cantik</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> the people there their are complexion all <malay>putih-putih</malay> and then I think probably I know why now because when I went there their food
is always some kind of (err) herbal food <malay>dia punya makanan</malay> is very different from singapore like our singapore diet <malay>kita banyak lemak-lemak kita banyak pakai</malay> (err) <malay>makanan yang</malay> very oily but there in korea their food
a lot of steam food a lot of soup a lot of herbs
and they always like to eat their favorite #kimchi# so I think their diet really helps them out to for them to look even more <malay>kacak</malay> and <malay>cantik</malay> [lah] actually
[oh] ya because their their location have (err) what you call that four seasons but for us in singapore it's just hot all year round because we are located <malay>dekat</malay> equator
so I mean I'm pretty sure (uh) countries <malay>yang ada</malay> four seasons of course their complexion would be even better I mean if you go to [ah] further up north
places <malay>macam</malay> (err) sweden <malay>ke</malay> or you go to norway or finland if you <malay>tengok</malay> their completion <malay>putih macam letak bedak</malay> kind of putih
so of course I wish I had that kind of a complexion but it's okay no problem
and (err) one thing <malay>kalau</malay> want to talk about (uh) going on vacation and stuff I think one (err) important aspect about going to vacation is to <malay>naik kapal terbang</malay> like honestly I miss
I miss taking all this <malay>kapal terbang</malay> just to <malay>duduk</malay> inside the plane and then below you look out the window you can see the clouds you among the clouds and that
that feeling of like you are sitting
in a roller coaster when the plane [dah] <malay>nak</malay> takeoff <malay>atau</malay> the plane about to land I think that's why now COVID (err) introduce the
dining in the parked aeroplane like <malay>macam banyak orang nak pergi tapi dia punya</malay> pricing I would say to me is a bit expensive like you are eating
I think the cheapest one for the economy class is two hundred two hundred dollar plus just to be eating in a parked plane and sitting in the <malay>tempat</malay> economy
so maybe I will decide <malay>nak tengok nak pergi ke tak</malay> but probably not maybe you just want to sit the aeroplane and that's probably the closest thing [lah] that you can get to travelling during this
(err) COVID situation will you go for this (err) parked (err) <malay>makan</malay>
and also I think the the tickets for the business class and first class if I'm not wrong [lah] is about six hundred plus if I'm not wrong and honestly <malay>kalau nak fikir pasal</malay> six hundred plus I think that six hundred plus I can use
for better purposes six hundred plus I can use it for a staycation <malay>kat</malay> #sentosa# <malay>ke</malay> or I can use that money for
staycation at resorts world #sentosa#
I can use that for better purpose as an anyway since we are coming to december <malay>dah nak dekat</malay>
I would wait for the hundred dollars tourism voucher [lah] to use it and spend and help to revive the economy because I mean since <malay>orang kat luar</malay> cannot come in so obviously we are the ones who have to
do the spending and we are the ones who will have to
(err) help to revive our very own
economy so I hope that so I hope that I hope that (uh) we will we will be able to come out of this (uh) COVID nineteen strong and hopefully we will
go back to being normal arab we will all still stay happy and positive
okay so we have come to the end of this one hour conversation
thank you very much bye
