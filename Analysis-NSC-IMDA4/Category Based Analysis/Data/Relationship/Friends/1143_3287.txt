you still want to like (uh) you know pursue your interest
(uh) in science
<malay>tapi sebab tu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena ada macam apa tu orang kata</malay> (uh) <malay>barang-barang yang ada kena-mengena dengan sains</malay> [lah] okay okay okay okay okay

<malay>cakapnya tak sampai pun sepuluh minit baru empat minit</malay>
<malay>dia tengok</malay> time [lah]
<malay>juga</malay>
(mm) (mm)
okay
(uh) if there was a drama [kan] (um) I mean I like to watch action movie [lah] actually
martial arts <malay>ke</malay> action movie because that is really cray you know to me
ya cause action movie
(uh) it really like <malay>macam</malay> excite you (uh) you really makes you awake [tau] <malay>macam tak mengantuk</malay> you know at least at least [eh] when you watch [eh] your mind is not really working

(mmhmm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no [lah] that [one] is different question
(mmhmm)
(uh) I think fit body [lah] better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina (uh) you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors [lah] okay I mean like everyday life also [lah] we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
[ah] <malay>kita nak ke mana-mana kita nak pergi apa tu katakan</malay> [lah] <malay>pasar ke kita nak berjalan ke mana ke bila kita ada</malay> fit body
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
of of course [lah] you have the looks you know <malay>tapi kalau</malay> your body doesn't fit
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important [lah]
yes correct correct
ya correct of course (um) of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks (uh) you know [ah] people say you have it's naturally
it's like when you make yourself fit then your body your look also will be like (uh) <malay>macam orang kata tu cerah</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> glowing [kan] [ah] glowing so I mean it is
it is naturally [lah] like that
so what will you think
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya so you see [eh] like nowadays generation you can see the different generation [eh] how they are very (um) they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
you know or maybe makeup makeup makeup dresses but they forgot about to take care of their health they forgot about (uh) what to eat and what not to eat you see [ah] <malay>jadi dorang banyak macam</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak pergi mana tu</malay> (uh) <malay>makan</malay> fast food [kan] [ah] you see they they they forgot they forgot about the healthy foods
but then they they they always [ah] you know
(uh) they always think <malay>yang</malay> the important is to to have a good looks you know <malay>buat</malay> expensive makeup you know and then wear [ah] good good clothes you know so that they will look good
that is only external but not internal you see [ah] this is what they they forgot [lah] so I think (um)
younger generation need to be educate <malay>mesti kena dorang kena kena tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kena banyak membaca</malay>
and then [ah] <malay>dorang kena tahu</malay> [lah] you know (uh)
<malay>macam mana nak apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>mencegah penyakit daripada awal bukan macam</malay> like when they have already got the sickness they got disease then they will do something then they will try to exercise then they will try to
(uh) do the prevention then they will try to start to to eat healthy food I think no [lah] I think from from ya I mean <malay>daripada awal dah kena</malay> start [lah] <malay>macam</malay> choose <malay>makan-makanan yang terbaik itu semua</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) okay because I think about mental health [ah] it has to be
(uh)
it is not really easy to say [lah] okay it's not easy to say because we do not know [ah] what are the experiences that [ah] you know people (uh) I mean <malay>orang orang orang</malay> experience
[ah] <malay>pengalaman orang</malay> [kan] cause everybody has their own experiences <malay>ada</malay> background <malay>yang berbeza</malay>
so <malay>jadi</malay> (um) this mental health <malay>ni</malay>
(uh) I mean okay [lah] <malay>memang makanan tu penting</malay> okay that is the most important okay the what you you eat
you know like <malay>macam</malay> they <malay>selit</malay> lots of vegetables and fruits you know and don't take too much of sugar [ah] that is already <malay>dah</malay> important [lah] you know because even then
[ah] <malay>secara</malay> holistic yes and then
okay but then some people say some people say that (uh) but I I take vegetables I take also (uh) I don't drink too much of like canned drinks and all that but I still got mental issue you know [ah] depression ke <malay>apa</malay> so I I so I <malay>rasa</malay> that (um)
I <malay>rasa</malay> it is how you manage [lah] the situation
[ah] how [lah] you manage and you did also like <malay>macam</malay> talk to people (uh) with with your family you don't keep to yourself
see if you have any problems let's say you youngsters [eh] <malay>macam</malay> like when youngsters [eh] <malay>kita tak boleh simpan diri sendiri</malay> [lah] <malay>kita kena bercakap dengan orang</malay> [ah] <malay>bercakap dengan</malay> family <malay>tentang masalah kita abeh pilih kawan-kawan yang</malay> very <malay>menjayai</malay> you know
[ah] that any friends that you think that (uh) that support you and any friends that you that (uh) you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself [lah] whatever so that it doesn't when you have a problem you don't bottle up
[ah] <malay>jadi sesama</malay> [lah] you <malay>tak payah tak ada macam asyik nak fikir tentang masalah</malay> you [kan]
[ah] at least at least you have (uh) somebody to help you on how to solve the your problem
you long stem from under you know really overwhelming

(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
I think ya it's true it's true I think that (um) okay when you talking about the schools [eh] (um)
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being [ah] they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
so <malay>kadang-kadang orang ni dia boleh</malay> accept (uh) the first degree of stress
<malay>yang ada</malay> [ah] second third degree <malay>pun masih boleh terima</malay>
[ah] ya depends on <malay>dorang punya</malay> capacity so I I I think like everyone they must know their limits
and and parents <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> push [ah] cannot push them because if they know that their kid they must know they must know and understand whether their kid because if their kid are not the kind <malay>yang</malay>
can take the stress so you cannot push them further [lah]
[ah] because [ah]

(mm)
(mm) <malay>nak ke mana</malay> [eh] <malay>mungkin zaman kanak-kanak</malay> [lah]
(mm) <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>kanak-kanak sebab zaman kanak-kanak macam tak ada</malay> stress <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] <malay>zaman kanak-kanak zaman yang kita tak fikirkan apa-apa</malay> [ah] <malay>tak payah nak fikir kita tahu kita makan tidur main dah</malay> [ah] you see I mean
children days are really a a days that memorable days [lah] I mean
I I know that it maybe may be sound like (uh) like not not many people maybe not many people also have that memories children you know fond memories of (uh) like childhood memories [lah] childhood fond memories but like as for me
(mm) (uh) <malay>macam</malay> best [lah] <malay>kadang bila kenangkan</malay> (uh) <malay>waktu kecil-kecil dulu</malay> (uh) when my late dad was around [ah] how I spent my time with my dad and then (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(mm) <malay>bila kita sama-sama</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> spend time <malay>balik kampung</malay> you know a lot of things and as a children you don't really think so much [lah] about like
(uh) as a kid [ah] ya like work studies stress like so much you you know you eat you sleep [ah] that's it play around that's it of course always scolding from the parents but after that you find that
[ah] then you woke again then you you like play again you know [ah] you don't think so much about paying bills you don't think so much about other people <malay>punya</malay> problems like you have your own problem and you carry out your own problems you know you don't really think about other people <malay>punya</malay> problems ya <malay>macam</malay> those memories are I think are the best [lah]
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody [lah] have their own good childhood memories
(uh) there are some also children they are traumatised by their childhood memories you know that is not good for for for them [lah] but as for me my own experience (um) if I have a timer like what you say you know (uh) where where where do I want to go I <malay>nak pergi tu</malay> [lah] the my childhood life [lah] (mm)

within a floor think you can it you mention long term
(mmhmm)
so <malay>jadi</malay> (um) what you say you want to go to the the ages [lah] okay okay
I think <malay>peringkat umur</malay> [lah] [eh] I think (uh) that that that is the reason [ah] why like <malay>macam</malay> you you are still young you know
<malay>jadi macam rasa nak apa tu orang kata tu</malay>
(um)
<malay>orang kata tu pengetahuan nak nak</malay> (uh) <malay>kembangkan lagi pengetahuan</malay>
(uh) [kan] <malay>nak</malay> expand [kan] <malay>lagi</malay> your knowledge <malay>so jadi</malay>
you <malay>rasa sebab</malay> you <malay>perlu pergi</malay> to that ages you know to <malay>nak lebih mendalami lagi</malay> (uh) <malay>benda-benda yang</malay> you <malay>tak pasti benda-benda yang</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> (mm)
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) three wishes [eh]
(um) okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is (uh)
a healthy life [lah]
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then (um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>yang kedua ketiga apa</malay> [eh] okay [lah] <malay>yang pertama dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>kedua ketiga macam tak tahu lagi nak fikir apa apa lagi nak cakap</malay>
[oh] okay maybe (um) <malay>wang</malay> [lah] [ah] I think [oh] I <malay>nak jadi seorang</malay> millionaire [ah] <malay>bukan sahaja</malay> healthy <malay>tapi</malay> my wish
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>ada duit seperti jutawan jadi seorang jutawan ke apa</malay> [ah] I mean not for myself but I think [ah] I like to help others ya help others and then I like to give I like to give to charity [ah] I'm a very like <malay>macam</malay>
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children [eh] when they are in need children in hunger [ah] you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think (um) a bit sensitive to their situation
then <malay>bila kita ada duit tu kita ada ilmu yang banyak</malay> [ah] <malay>kita boleh sedekah kita boleh berikan kepada dorang</malay> so I think <malay>tu yang yang</malay> can give me the most satisfaction [lah] <malay>itu</malay> second wish [lah] second wish ya first first first first wish is healthy then second wish (uh) <malay>seorang jutawan</malay> [ah] <malay>kaya raya</malay>
<malay>sekarang ni kurang kaya</malay>
okay then the third one the third one the third one (uh) the third one
what is it [ah] third one [ah]
[ah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] you <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] what's your first wish and your second and third wish if you have
(mm)
like for me right I think the other wish is that (mm)
since I have (uh) children so of course I I don't really ask [ah] more like of course [lah] as a a parent you want to see your children [ah] succeed in their life you want to see your children like <malay>macam</malay>
have and will be a successful because the of course that is (uh) <malay>memang tak terkecuali memang</malay> you <malay>nak tengok anak</malay> you <malay>berjaya</malay>
but (um)
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy [lah] healthy body and healthy mind
(uh) and then the the best part is (uh) good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good (uh) behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
(um) respect others
(uh) yes then (um) the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important [lah]
(uh) to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
they are arrogant you know they arrogant towards other people <malay>macam sombong gitu macam apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>tak nak dengar kata orang lain</malay> you know <malay>macam terlalu</malay> ego <malay>ke</malay> so I
I I just hope [lah] that my children are not like that and then (uh) I just hope that whatever that my children do they must (uh) always think that life is really temporary
(uh) in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there (um)
(err) <malay>tidak ada perkara yang</malay> (uh) <malay>kekal dekat dunia ni</malay> so <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) whatever that you have whatever that cherish it [lah] cherish it and also share share among other people
[ah] that is my my wishes [lah] I I think for my for my children
for my children
(mm)
<malay>hancur</malay>
people will like <malay>macam apa tu</malay> [ah] respect you [lah] respect you
yes correct no I mean (uh) of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
you know [ah] in this life right <malay>manusia manusia ni dorang</malay> [ah] <malay>memang akan tengok pandang tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>kepada dorang yang berduit ni semua</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>berduit tapi</malay> you <malay>tak ada akhlak pun boleh pandang rendah juga</malay>
[ah] you see so the best thing is (uh) whatever it is ya <malay>buat yang baik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada duit pun tapi</malay> you <malay>sombong</malay> [kan]
[ah] so <malay>tak ada gunanya</malay> [lah] <malay>orang pun</malay> people don't look up for you people don't look into you and people don't treat you as a someone that can show a good example to generations you know and people will forget you I mean if people want to remember you yes but people remember you as a person who has who is arrogant [ah] you know you have a
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct
ya
yes yes yes yes correct
<malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower [eh] <malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower I <malay>nak habiskan kerja rumah dalam satu minit</malay>
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> flash [ah] speed [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam tu macam</malay> speed <malay>gitu macam</malay> whatever that I want (uh) I do [eh] I want to do in a very fast manner
[ah] you see
then I I I clean up the house right like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! <malay>habis</malay> one minute gone or two minutes !wah! all the house clean already <malay>semua dah bersih</malay> !wah! see I I I
(uh) I mean like then you can have <malay>apa orang kata tu</malay> relax <malay>lama-lama</malay>
[ah] <malay>rehat lama-lama</malay> [ah] but unfortunately I do not have that such power
(um) <malay>tapi kalau ada</malay>
ya no
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
ya
ya
there is (uh) good and bad [lah] we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first [eh]
see [ah] there there is a good and bad [lah] when talking about phones okay (uh) cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
[ah] you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know like mac also you also using your phone don't need to you know like last time you use (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] you know <malay>senang semua</malay> but okay <malay>dulu kalau nak masak kita nak kena fikir buku pastu</malay> flip flip flip the pages [ah] <malay>sekarang tak payah sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] you <malay>tengok</malay> [jer] youtube
[ah] you google [jer] okay <malay>nak cari resipi apa masak apa</malay> [ah] then you know from then on can you can already (uh) find the recipe that you want
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy [lah] and everything information at the fingertips but
main problem like <malay>contohnya</malay> I think for adults [eh] adults should be okay because they already know how to use the phone they know [ah] they know when to use it you know (uh) they they know like <malay>macam</malay> when not to use it you know they they they have the <malay>orang kata tu tahu bila nak</malay> focus <malay>tapi kalau</malay> children <malay>memang</malay> talking <malay>budak-budak ni</malay> you see when they are already get used to phones at an early age [eh]
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
you have TikTok and <malay>dorang dah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam malas sekejap macam sekejap-sekejap nak tengok</malay> TikTok <malay>sekejap-sekejap nak nak nak apa nak buat</malay> TikTok [kan]
[ah] <malay>kerja rumah semua terbengkalai</malay> then homework <malay>pun terbengkalai</malay> [kan] and then (uh) last time [eh] you see (uh) <malay>budak-budak dulu</malay> they want to watch the television they they if they want to on the television their parents will scold them [eh] cannot watch television [ah] you haven't finish your homework now they watch youtube also you do not know because the phone is with them [ah] you see so
the I mean it's difficult [lah] to control it is more I think challenging
[ah] now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control [ah] you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy [lah] it's not really easy
(mm) it's not really easy
[ah] you yourself you think how you because you yourself ask you to sleep you don't want to sleep you see you are you you you <malay>suka tengok</malay> youtube you <malay>suka tengok</malay> netflix [ah] <malay>lagi sekarang</malay> netflix <malay>selalu dekat</malay> phone [ah] you see <malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
<malay>nak nak nak</malay> stop <malay>ataupun kita nak ketepikan</malay> (mm) handphone <malay>tu</malay>
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
(um) <malay>pun ada</malay> good and bad <malay>dia</malay> [lah] maybe maybe I understand that people they are using this is to maybe cut cost
of (uh) you know human skills and all that but then when you think about it [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> were to take over humans [kan] then what humans going to do you know certain things <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [kan] certain things I think (um) can you know take over humans <malay>tapi</malay> certain like <malay>macam</malay> profession <malay>tak boleh</malay> take over humans [ah] you know I think certain certain professions [lah] not all professions you know <malay>macam</malay> doctor you that's why <malay>boleh jadi</malay> doctor [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> <malay>jadi</malay> doctor
I <malay>rasa</malay> patient <malay>tengok pun takut takut dengan dengan dengan</malay> [ah] you see <malay>ataupun</malay> nurses take over nurses I I don't think so [lah] that's why I tell you <malay>macam</malay> certain professions (uh) <malay>memang tak kena</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> I mean take over
still need (uh) you know human ya you still need human touch you know human skills you know and then can you imagine <malay>kalau</malay> take over <malay>abeh kita ni nak kerja apa</malay> [ah] you know how to earn money like that
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the
[ah] so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
see so <malay>kalau macam</malay> humans [kan] <malay>lain</malay> humans [kan] [ah] humans <malay>ada</malay> limitation [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> sponge [kan] humans <malay>dia boleh</malay> adjust
[ah] you see so <malay>ye</malay> [lah] and and to add to that and to add to your <malay>ini</malay> [kan] questions you <malay>tengok macam</malay> [ah] <malay>apa</malay> maid <malay>pembantu rumah</malay>
[ah] you see you are not going to to let the to become the maid of the house right [ah] you know like in terms of like cleaning up maybe [lah] can but then in terms of you talking about [eh] taking after the old people don't know (uh) how to how to really like <malay>macam</malay> like you say [lah] human touch they lack of that
(um) you see
ya I mean mean of of course
use use the app for for <malay>macam</malay> good purpose [lah] I think for cleaning up no problem because like like <malay>macam</malay> you talking about cleaning up there's not much of like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I mean skills yes you must have the skills but not so much of like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) thoughts to put into it you know when you do cleaning up (um) like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you do the job cleaners and all that (uh) simple simple job can take over [lah]
(uh) you know but other jobs that require (uh) you know you need deep thoughts <malay>ataupun kemahiran</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kemahiran yang orang kata tu yang yang besar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> doctor <malay>dia punya kemahiran dia betul-betul besar</malay> [kan] so <malay>takkan</malay> you <malay>nak suruh</malay> take over [kan] (mm) you see
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>tengok kepada keperluan pada keadaan pada keperluan pada keadaan memang</malay> when you talk about technology in years to come [ah] <malay>macam-macam</malay> [kan] technology <malay>akan datang</malay> so <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) we'll see [lah] that
<malay>mana yang lebih perlu</malay> [lah] at which at which sector
(mm)
(mm) [ah] [ah] then after that
ya
ya
!wah! I think [ah] I think with this right people will have develop more mental health problem
rather than you know like <malay>sekarang sahaja orang dah macam-macam ada banyak masalah</malay> mental problem <malay>sekarang</malay> I think <malay>kalau ada kita nak adakan</malay> <malay>lagi</malay> (um) <malay>orang kata untu menggantikan</malay> (uh) all the professions (uh) <malay>orang akan ada banyak lagi masalah</malay> mental health problem
(mm) and and and one thing and one thing <malay>pun</malay> I think (um) if you <malay>nak</malay> have this right <malay>untuk menggantikan</malay> the soldiers <malay>pun</malay> not bad so that you you don't use so many soldiers let's say you go to war [ah] [kan] <malay>tak ada ramai</malay> [lah] human beings <malay>yang mati</malay> (mm)
