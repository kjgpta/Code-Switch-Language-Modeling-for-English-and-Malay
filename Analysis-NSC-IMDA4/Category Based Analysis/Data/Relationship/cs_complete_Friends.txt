okay so kau pergi kindergarten mana
I don't know she start macam lip gloss punya
baik tak payah beli seh
aku ingat yang that time yang twitter dia the thing about her yang she send herself question
ya I still remember then send the then I macam eh kau answer question kau sendiri pe
okay then lagi siapa lagi dekat sekolah kau
aku pergi yang yang tepi funan tu
okay then um kau tahu yang macam rushaidi abeh humaira
dia dengan humaira semua sama dia sama class dengan aku juga then after that like he used to like me ah that time where we were we were young macam merepek kan like obviously kau just anyhow choose and like a person then lepas tu dia macam tulis a letter and then dia kasi kat humaira then dia suruh pass kat aku
I think humaira did but then she just tutup balik but then like humaira tanya aku eh humaira told me macam eh macam mana dia kasi aku letter sia dia suruh kasi kau then I told her aku tak nak aku cakap dengan dia tak payah kasi aku then after that she apa ni she insist she kasi juga she give it to me then aku buka aku baca then aku macam you know lah I like you lah whatever then after that aku nampak rushaidi was like hiding and looking
then then pastu aku nampak dia tengah tengok aku sengaja aku koyakkan kan then aku buang dalam rubbish bin
dia tengok dia macam dia tengok dia dah terkejut tau and he was shocked lah then after that he uh but after that he still continue to like me and you know he whenever I say like uh where's my block my teacher ask where's your block all abeh he will story to the class dia akan cakap his house is behind my block abeh dia cakap something then teacher ask which school do you wanna go then I say xingnan then he also say xingnan
ya bodoh kan it was damn stupid sia
no ah aku rasa dulu tak ada tak ada test kot it's just learning only kau belajar apa
aku belajar A B C semua itu aja jangan-jangan then yang oh kau punya is islamic school right
oh I saw kau ambil gambar lah
ya you look the same tapi but ada lah nampak difference
kat kindergarten
kau pun sama perangai macam eh
sekarang apa dah okay
but dia tak tahu eh
dia tak ingat he didn't even remember that
ya any stories dari primary school you went to which primary school
why korang never just start your name with like arina and diana
ya so sekarang orang panggil kau arina kan
oh ya abeh dia takyah surgery
kurang ajar sia tu
apa nak cakap like you grow out of this
ya last time I was okay cute then after that suddenly the you know period eh period pula sekali the maturing phase I oh my god I just look so oof but okay lah at least now I look better
ya but it was so funny was so funny literally funny gila
nice ke
sekolah kita is just not creative
primary five right starting of primary five I like this guy so much then I was I already prepared I rehearse kat rumah you know I rehearse how do I tell this guy then then I talk to the wall all this like pretending like that guy is the guy ah then after that sekali I met him in real life that time was Mendaki so Mendaki class then I told him ah I like him right then he reject me sia
you don't know who but her name was zulaikha I told her macam eh I like this guy sia then she she encourage me to confess to the guy you know I confess to the guy right then after that tak jadi then I told her semua then the guy cakap like he not ready all this then after that she like she cheer me up all this right end up you guess what two weeks later she got together with the guy
you gave me encouragement and all then suddenly kau yang get together with the guy
oh my god dia dah pergi dengan amira is it
see kalau she want to lie to you kan what is this
petty sia kau
zennis yang kawan dia iman tu she's muslim right
oh then kat luar it's already the swimming pool
oh she wear jubah
wait but right dia is she like religious
eh diam lah
buta sia
then after that why you all sit together dekat-dekat
but I actually want to know right how how you found the motivation to wear hijab like fully like what makes you
apa eh yang safi saw in this guy
okay wait I actually know the story okay tapi you just story I remember I remember the story
I can see that he's very introverted you know it's like very maacam senyap from his photo also I can see he he's a very senyap kind
tak macam how how you feel like okay uh from the start eh like when you just know him
have you ask afiq whether did he like really wanted to find a hijabi girl or
then how how you feel like eh boleh if I if the guy like macam afiq eh he talk to me like that he tak jaga my hati right I straightforward nah this is not the guy then I will just like stop it how how did you just continue
tak tahu ah I just I think my heart just not open yet you know okay sekarang ni orang kau nampak yang selalu marry kan you see like mira filzah also she marry someone she met a few times only
see sekali aku like twenty plus then I met someone yang macam betul-betul like god open my eyes
she can like him not for his looks cause he's more I saw his post kan he's more of those macam work kind of guy
that kind of guy the more pandai kind of person I rather more fun kind of person than
macam aku rasa boring though
itu ah macam I thought if mira with zizan right zizan is like he he's fun and entertaining what he don't have looks I don't mind sia
they say like charli you can just post anything what and people will just like it what she can just post a picture of her stoning and she can get millions of like gitu-gitu dah ya
abeh yang the bella that one she just
no lah you very kaku sia in front of
jom ah jadi agent rumah
exactly the rich yang tak perlu they get more stuff than the people who need need cause they want promote their products obviously can make this kind of people
eh not bad sia my only drop to two point something I think ni will drop some more
dia dah dia dah twenty one he start at nineteen
twenty habis itu twenty dia twenty one eh twenty
habis poly
then after that he have to go so I think twenty one dia enlist or twenty
let's say pergi twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty three dia akan keluar twenty three baru keluar
itu pun kalau dia straightaway like okay after this I do this after this kalau dia macam nak stop sekejap nak kerja
no cause that one is right I think is kalau I don't know ah I think because I oh is masters masters then you need that one to two years of working experience
bachelor is before ni kan before degree right
you should join before before poly my friend dah masuk NAFA now
so if I'm not wrong damn expensive though but kena kerja one year
he singaporean also he have to kerja one year and tak pergi sekolah for one month
tak tau dia kata tak dapat then he work starbucks for one year baru work
tak tahu lah dia suka ah dia suka
some more mak dia tak nak bayarkan he have to pay himself
abeh yang she study and she's good at it also it's good lah because like if you have uni you have uni like you have a degree then after that you will have higher pay enter only will have higher pay if not you're let's say if you enter with a diploma then your gaji is two point five then if you enter with a degree your gaji is three point five something like that
ya if not if you enter with a diploma and then you have to slowly work up you know macam two point five abeh maybe after two years later your boss naikkan gaji two point seven two point eight I don't know
so is kalau I just stop at diploma I can make like three point two ah if I go for a hospital
so they add up together dah seven K seven K is enough
bagus ah
but like I think for comfortable life macam betul-betul comfortable you don't need to think about financial issues right minimum five K I think
uh no it's the same uh like food but then another another shop so like she buka same shop
mana lah aku tahu kan
like I tried lah like my mum own cooking at home sedap ah takkan aku nak cakap mak aku masak tak sedap
ya then she learn she learn from like internet facebook all this I don't for she interested in this kind of thing eh like kitchen I am not at all then she ask me to help aku macam I don't like lah this kind of thing then after that she ask my sister itu semua untuk buka this kind of shop
ya you know yang kedai yang ni she actually wanted to
oh ya you actually wanted to tutup the shop and open because she want to open another shop but then end up she think back pasal her her work workers macam tak bagus her workers like take advantage like she pay her worker like seventy dollars per day
ya it's just like that I mean dia punya pekerja like the food standard is always macam tak constant sekejap sedap sekejap tak sedap that kind
my mum pay monthly four K orang semua terkejut sia
dorang macam how you make money here then mak aku macam uh cause my mum she smart lah in business she smart in business she just put everything macam orang nak taruk barang tu semua kan then they just tell people then she just put on her barang
so she just take everything and just put macam no matter benda tu orang nak ke tak just put lah like kalau orang nak beli
tapi because the shop is too expensive per four K per month then I tell my mum takyah lah tutup ah kedai ni mahal sia
like if let's say if you find another shop like one K plus then that three K can be yours then can add up to your three K can be six K already you earn then this one you pay four K to them just like that I mean bill kena bayar sendiri
bil api air semua kena bayar sendiri then aircon dalam tu macam rosak gitu so cannot feel
ya uh tak dia repair but you know the thing is kita tak ada aircon ah the aircon macam tak boleh rasa then abeh you have still have to pay for the aircon shit
pastu engine dia keep trip ah macam dia punya mak aku my mum say can only open like two switches at a time abeh macam mana nak masak cepat-cepat like two switch at a time kalau nak panaskan it's like very lambat kan
abeh lepas tu then they they thing keep trip the whole thing just trip kan tak ada lampu for like thirty minutes tak ada lampu tau then the person will scold us say I tell already right you can open two two switch
what the hell two switch abeh dah lah mahal abeh kau cakap buka two switch
merepek kan then mak aku dah aku cakap dengan mak aku tutup jer ah kedai ni then after that my mum macam sedih ah to leave the kedai seh like like the kedai then after that my dad already dah tukarkan the wire the whole wire because you know last time can open two switch now my dad dah tukar we can open all the switch already then it won't trip bapa aku cakap they use the wire yang lousy the wire like literally the cheapest wire
ya that's why kau buka tu switch jer dah trip
exactly abeh lepas tu bapa bapa aku yang buat sia semua yang the whole wire then he do by himself then like you know my mum already put in a lot lah for that shop abeh dia sedih nak tutup the shop then after that when we ask her to tutup she like tak nak ah then she say you know what if I continue to just open the shop then at least she say monthly she can still get three K what she open another shop then she can earn more what because she's interested you know this food food shit ah aku tak aku tak interested
jom ah kita buka sama-sama kau masak aku
right right kalau kita buka together then you can cook then I will be the server
kita how about we do western food and not
malay nasi
kita taruk mi rebus plus fish and chips
or like put like chilli crab punya sauce right
or we put um kuah mi soto
ya I can see you your love for soto ayam
that soto ayam
murah seh
malay food I like you know yang nasi rawan but that was so that is so good uh uh
but it's like at pioneer point I don't know I think can sit there and eat but then kedai dia selalu tutup my father always go saturday tutup sunday tutup then my father macam apa ni business macam mana nak buka ni kalau
pasal dulu it never close you know
mahal kedai tu is like you know that time they asking from sara for twelve K a month
ya sara says sara told me last time I was close to her juga what last time
yup because at first it was at four K plus after that they saw macam sara punya kedai always banyak banyak queue then long queue every time then the person keep increasing macam you are trying to benefit from people punya business
kedai lain semua dah tak naik tank
is cannot what cause that is the person's shop what kalau kau it's either you stay or leave ah gitu if the person say okay if you don't want pay then you leave ah
you imagine eh kalau kedai sekarang ni yang that twelve K a month you think they can earn or not after that
and like apa the shop obviously the shop owner dia sengaja nak sara punya father keluar that's why naikkan tinggi-tinggi nanti sara father cannot pay then surrender the shop
kedai tu ah
tu jer that's all you know
cause they always keluar gi malaysia all this together
now dorang ni ke
is either at home biasanya dorang masak kat rumah then they send to the shop
ya ya that's why maybe they busy ke dorang both at the shop
sekarang bapa dia bawa grab pe
should be business tak cukup or like they have a lot of things to pay ah pasal dulu kan the business very good
then after that sekarang dah tak bagus then the father ambil car abeh ambil motor berapa banyak biji motor dia nak then the father buy for the kakak the abang pun all motor abeh sekarang business dah tak bagus how then he have to grab ah bawa grab pay for all this thing because obviously all these you haven't pay finish what
kena bayar so it's either untuk aku your if I am the father I will surrender the motor then just use the car
abeh nak bayar banyak-banyak how to afford
tak lah aku tak boleh ah
kau berani naik motor macam nasib kau afiq ada motor kan nanti dia
abeh takkan kau nak bilang mak kau kan safi nak naik motor dengan
dulu aku naik motor dengan aku punya kawan lelaki semua mak aku aku rasa mak aku tak tahu at all sia
tapi actually aku pun takut aku macam dah fikir macam kalau aku jatuh ni eh kalau ayah aku tahu mampus sia
it's not like it's not the guy's fault what you also want you also want to naik
the situation sekarang COVID
ya because got crowd control so ada banyak-banyak timing so
tengok timing lah selalu kalau timing jam satu gitu lepas lunch ah
banyak orang because they all rush in
ya ah then especially kalau pakai mask kan ah tu lah
ah kan ya then I don't know I feel I feel like I a bit rude but at the same time is just takpe lah eh orang pekak so biarkan jer
ah ah seh just to ah kalau pergi shopping mall pun susah kan walaupun nak beli like one thing only like bubble tea
kan kan like um so sometimes like we just want to minum air and then like people just suddenly stare at you like chill I just I just drinking water
orang pakai mask but never cover the nose like
ah kenapa
eh apa dia buat
mmhmm and then apa
basically okay lah dua macam dua alam like malay call it dua alam
I tried going on dating apps ah you know ya ya ya Tinder Muzmatch ya especially that so bila I kat sana then
it's just the way that they text the way that they reply sometimes I don't like you know sometimes like the way they spell certain stuff you know like you can just say it to me in like one long sentence but you have to kasi short form macam
uh they are actually quite hype they they they boleh berbual ah everything but
you know what I I don't really like you know talking to you you know like just ugh very cringe but it's just you know sadly some some of them are actually nice it's just suka it's just a preference
so ya talking about that tu pun
can still use your picture obviously because if not it will be catfish lah technically kalau
right so so macam kat Telegram or what then you send the video message thing at least they know like ah okay this person is this face but the name
lain lah but tu jer maybe your age lain sikit maybe your birthday lain sikit
okay maybe one of us who are like twenty one years old nak berbual dengan dorang then tiba-tiba I don't know kena
I don't know she was a minor because she never put in her bio or something and then who's fault is it you whose one handcuffs ah you you kena
you kena what house arrest ah that one
you kena the watch on the
I think maybe to a certain extent boleh macam
macam orang yang buat macam gini just to be like a predator or something that one is a no no
okay ah so hari ni makan apa tadi tadi makan apa
ah lah takpe sama I had the Nissin seafood one very nice
seven eleven one ah ah okay lah not bad sedap juga
eh apa nama dia
dulu bila kat sekolah it's just um
I had a crush on this girl so biasa lah eh like cinta monyet everything and then just macam oh my god secondary school ada mata air baru
and then ada lah kawan ni from primary school
and then uh well I have it's just like you like I had a sus feeling you know like the vibes and everything so so okay but I still ignore lah cause I thought like mana tahu secondary school it's a different ah ya ya ya like even though it's like primary six to sec one
dah mature a bit lah ah
I was talking to the guy on the phone and everything I selalu bawa dia ajak dia into the conference call like that because okay lah me being you know seeing her as my
best friend at that point of time macam
you know I want to include you and everything I do so like I tak malu lah ya so but then it's just the the stupid thing is that um
before before that night a few days before the dude and I dah confess so so we we okay lah we say that oh I like I like you too and everything it's cute but then the thing is we confess at playground with letters we roll each other letters you know ya right it's not over over text like I I state my no lah
so on the night we were talking and everything then I ask him lah like do you do you want to go to the next level gitu biasa lah eh you know I dah desperate kan so and then he like ah boleh jer like I okay because I suka you and everything and I'm like aww okay apa-apa jer lah so as long as you and I together
cinta monyet I just said it
ya but for us we don't use puppy we use monyet so monyet because it's ya it's playful basically because we
we see monkeys as very playful so like that lah but I feel like kalau puppy love is quite cute
where was I ah so during the phone call and then we were talking like that and then my best friend was there then dia dengar jer lah so she just like okay tak tak kepoh lah because I ajak so it's fine macam member sunyi
the whole school his whole cohort dapat tahu that
ya I mean that's how much I sayang her as a friend lah that I the first person that I look to is my ex that time so and then he was like takde ah takde cakap apa-apa like you think I that kind of person to share and like that then I was like okay lah mana tahu
after that we I just like okay lah takpe I lupakan jer and then
yang perempuan tu suka dia juga so ya hmm tak player is he he's just never been in a relationship before except except for with me
apa lagi eh so lepas tu
the girl that used to like my ex uh before my ex and I got together she she hated me lah cause I so called aku rampas dia punya
ya then aku macam
bro you you never make your first move how how is it my fault precisely how is it my fault also ya sure korang suka each other but if if I like him and then somehow he fell for me also and then okay lah then that means I I put in effort what and unlike you you just you just like you see from afar and just like hi then for me it's just like
ah padahal dorang ke apa okay no hate lah sia no hate but it's just
not spending time I prefer befriending ya I forgot the word befriending dengan lelaki and everything because they very chill sure you need to find the balance between the guy friends lah
because tak buang waktu sia like kau
kau penat-penat kau berbual dengan dorang kau lepak dengan dorang and then setakat they just like eh your friend single or not then like what the fuck bro
sikit jer ke banyak ni
deserves maybe you guys never you never end it off properly macam tak sedap
itu not
steep cut but kau tak cakap apa-apa then why why would he
I I tadi marah because ada orang terlanggar you know then like your girlfriend will just rely a'ah I faham faham but if you tell a guy is just like
setakat dia cuma langgar jer pe ah like that wait maybe maybe I can say we are too sensitive or kita overreact but
hmm tu lah get out but I got this story back when I was in I had this classmate she was very clingy gitu macam dia
dia dia tak ada banyak kawan lah because dia pendiam then bila orang
sama-sama but for her it's just how to say ah
setakat aku nak kawan dengan semua orang dalam class so
kalau apa-apa nak berbual it's okay lah like rather than you just have beef with everyone like for what and then
lepas tu she became clingy then mana-mana aku pergi dia nak ikut then it's like ah dia dia perangai macam lelaki like she insecure lah because she she's afraid of people abandoning her so when I talk to other classmates she will just like
eh asal kau berbual dengan dia sia then aku macam
biar ah aku nak berbual dengan siapa and then it's like and then it's like ada ah project and everything so for project work
I had to choose ah I was given finally given the chance to choose my own group because dulu is dorang main ambil jer lah which
which was sad because I had those free loaders and everything and lepas tu I didn't pick her because she herself was the free loader
but she she she never realise because sebagai kawan I never tegur because out of kesian right you know like it's your own friend you sayang your friend and everything
and then she she text me she sound me and everything she say why why you never pick me for your group and then aku cakap
oh ah aku tak pick pun dorang yang pick aku
I bohong ah because I don't want her to get hurt but in the end she did and then in the end she found out lah ya and then she
and then bila tengah buat project then she will complain like uh you know akunya group macam gini macam gitu then
but that one I feel like for everyone is normal you know if everyone if everyone if someone just overly control you you would just feel tak sedap hati macam apa sia aku buat aku dengan kau siapa sia kawan jer
okay lah just share share sikit leh dengan
lepak bawah blok eh ah
okay that's cute I guess macam abang-abang ah gitu kan abang-abang yang bulat ah um ah betul betul betul
oh sombong eh ah oh ya that's true
cakap jer lah
so cili padi is like small and feisty and spicy
member kucing ke robot pun tak tahu
ah so the youngest all the very degil-degil bukan ke oh shit
alah but so high so high with energy maybe maybe oh but with other people a bit oh malu-malu
so dia dia tinggal kat rumah atau
kenapa kau yang jumpa atau your family members your other family members oh
anak derhaka ni lu dengar eh dengar eh
wow that's cute um alah cute nya tak payah beli bantal ada kucing
ah so that's why you call cili padi
macam especially
ya it's just it's just ayam masak ya that's true
uh apa eh
uh econs ah ya and it was like so difficult but we were on a zoom with like seven other students then we all buat the test together
we just macam one student apa tu one student screen share dia punya screen like when he was when he while he was doing the the quiz ah
we all help him lah do the quiz then after that then we all collate the answer abeh kita submit
but lucky lah cause like I never study my friend also never study then we just action jer macam like uh A A I think it's A
huh kenapa
um aku tak tahu yang besok deepavali actually
tabbouleh eh kat itu uh arab street eh

I tried before also kat arab street but
pricey kan macam it's mahal
oh is it macam dia macam cake right eh no
oh yes yes yes yes yes ya ya ya ya ya ya I know what I know what you're talking about ah that one sedap seh
oh kat arab street also
baru buka oh
I feel like eating apa konditori dekat arab street
is it damn sedap serious ya
but its like damn sedap lah when I go there like aku always beli
oh dia jual ice cream eh oh ya ya ya ya but I never try the the waffle one
ya wah so today you jalan-jalan ah oh
wah wait you pergi dengan siapa
ya I just did school stuff cause aku belum habis essay
bila submit deadline
ya so that's why ni kena fast game
ya abeh rumah dia
my friend's house tadi
rumah dia macam sejuk ah then I was like sneezing
abeh but if she off macam panas
the kipas not strong enough
ya and then we just ya we just had lunch abeh supposed to uh apa buat our assignment ah then she like uh penat ah
ya then I was like eh I come to your house then her parents balik her parents balik uh apa dining cause we were studying at the dining table
then the was beside the dining table and macam their sofas and everything ah right
then parents dia okay I eat dinner ah abeh just on switch on the then we are like trying to study
I think but she wasn't even doing work so it didn't bother her lah and I also think macam she
dah biasa ya and she like couldn't tell that it was like affecting me cause like maybe it does
don't want ah so rude ya some more rumah dia like I don't want to say
uh apa tu last week did you watch the soccer game
tottenham siapa eh I think
dengan siapa I don't know who then um gareth
ya then we won apa eh jap let me check the score I think it was like
ya but it was like macam last minute was like a last minute goal ya
ya nasib but we needed it because after the
second was apa eh can't remember ah maybe like
everton ke apa I don't know and then uh but only for like half an hour they were top cause they had a match with um wolves dengan
but you had school or memang takde
oh then but sampai bila
your macam when's the deadline
rabak pe
then um oh that time you mentioned kan ah yang you nak pergi tu
but okay so if borders buka pergi tak
cause sometimes like even borders buka like still doesn't mean that you know can go right
but dah buka borders belum it's still closed
but anyway um I just found out yang the international business students in my course
uh they are supposed to I think in their like third year they're supposed to go to lah to to study abeh sekarang border closed right and also the cases rising kan
then I think cause I didn't know that we have another campus kat dubai
ya I didn't know that ya so then I heard lah macam I don't know if it's true or not macam the students will go there
that's why macam tak
that's why macam like tak dengar at all right about dubai like corona cases ya so
but lucky I'm not student ah cause anyway if in in any cases macam both tak buka or both not accepting like foreigners then you waste your money right
I remember that aku teringat there's this um guy in my primary school macam he he's from new zealand ah
ya tapi dia mix macam cina ah dia cina dengan
so last time aku ada this whatsapp group
and also last time my english wasn't that good like it wasn't great lah and I like my grammar macam like
uh sembarang right ya then after that
I type something I think I type like macam
he oh sorry I typed if I'm not wrong lah maybe something like she have kan salah right ya
ya then I macam at that point of time I was like rude
a'ah mak dia masak tak lah we ordered food
ya then she was like oh malas then I was like okay lah fine just order jer
okay lah I think that time also aku dua minit abeh aku hit curb abeh dia like terus suruh balik
ya mine also mine was smooth also macam
ya or not confirm like lambat gila
ya and the pakcik
I don't know I think dia penat
uh like some allied educator dekat but it's under ah ya
it's outdoor activity macam outdoor outdoor learning ya
belum she just went for the english test
but I think the english test should be final macam like the final round I guess ya then she will know lah ya
ya then kalau she nak ajar kat secondary then kena ambil degree ah ya
I suddenly macam nak apply for
at first macam
tak my ambition eh dengar my ambition like when I was younger was to teach macam like ya like I always know oh maybe I want to become teacher whatever
and then like and then throughout mm secondary school poly macam okay not so much like not so much of like I wanna be a teacher and things like that
then suddenly but now I don't know why macam I feel that maybe being a teacher is not so bad after all
so macam like what you do
oh okay so macam for example
so for for example macam okay you like a company wants to manufacture food ah so they will come to people like you is it
oh faham faham
macam niche lah right ya baik ah
oh anyway ya speaking of becoming a teacher like the whole point I feel that a career should be fulfilling right macam
I don't want to just ya like I don't want to just work for the money you know macam ambil duit abeh balik ya
as in nursing belajar nursing
but to be honest macam just take one thing at a time ah
ya I mean and she baru start kerja
exactly abeh nak ambil nursing
but it's tough lah I mean it's ya it's banyak nak kena fikir
no as in aku tahu ah
not in the in that regard but macam
don't know kalau don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
so did you apply for the for the madrasah course
ilmu ilmu apa eh pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat ah gitu
and kebanyakan macam orang
duh but orang muda ya macam our age ah
it's not a syarahan it's really macam kau belajar buku like all the buku tak tahu lah dia like macam ada banyak banyak buku
kitab sure like okay sure ya
but interesting lah ya macam some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
macam sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting ah and the ustad funny
macam he's like the abang-abang type dia macam just buat kelakar ah like every single every single lesson
not we are not rapat lah but macam
as in like it's not like we talk everyday ke apa
ah ya like ya we are just no but serious macam in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other lah ya
because macam not that productive
oh abeh
it's recorded ya so macam what's the point
if you wanna sit in abeh some of the students tanya banyak soalan and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching uh one of the videos kan as it dia macam just tanya for like like twenty minutes non stop
abeh lecturer dia boleh layan and he's a he's an old man lah so of course lah macam I think dia macam like
ambil hati and he would he will also macam just jawab lah all of apa dia punya questions
ya so ya it's damn unproductive lah but then again macam if go back on campus lessons only like tiga jam
but malas ya and jauh jauh seh tempat dia
but I tried going to campus before aku naik train
ya abeh kena stop ah dekat
ah boleh ah no
lupa ah lupa
tak pernah pergi but that time once I went there aku stop dekat I think bugis
err tak I stop at bugis abeh tukar
ya duh takkan I stop at bugis sia abeh kena naik bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like kalau my apa my kakak dapat then my dad will belikan kereta
just change ah macam siapa siapa like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no lah for what balik ah
ya fikir ah
but jauh naik public bus
satu kat kan
abeh the other one
but tadi I not tadi lah the other day I took train macam semua orang like rapat-rapat
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin macam they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think belum lagi phase two then they remove
macam just because like oh decrease ye ye o jer abeh tak ye ye o seh
mm kat mana
no tak cause that time I like aku lapar gila at like two and I want to order ah abeh like closed ya
no like macam ya
it has been right ya I get I think macam cause COVID abeh dia orang tukar
but that time aku pergi raimah dengan kawan aku
malam ah ya and it was like damn crowded then I was like oh I should have known ya

I don't know I don't think so takde pun
I'm curious now how come takde eh
then your school macam usually is it two weeks
baik pe
penat seh I didn't know uni was this difficult
macam in like after after I finish working lah that
kan abang aku tinggal kat situ ya like macam just visit dia ah
tak um brisbane
ya but boleh drive to gold coast ah ya
but uh on the left or right dia punya driving
ayah aku just uh apa drive ah kat situ ya
and it quite easy macam I see lah I think it's quite easy
kat singapore tak boleh
kat singapore tak boleh
ada pe
sentosa ada pe
tak tahu rope eh
dekat kallang ada
oh ya life jacket kau nak pakai life guard
yes I did yang my dad even showed me a photo
are you serious seram pe
ya but I read somewhere macam
let's not look at western countries as like good places that like we can retire or stay you know what I mean macam ya
no I ya I ask her no I think I was like telling her lah macam oh I'm not so sure what I want to do with my life then she was like okay do you want to stay in singapore or like overseas
and then she was like okay for me I know that I don't want to stay in singapore that's why I study in cause I think she have plans lah to stay there ke apa
and I was like oh okay cool I mean bapa kau ada duit lah so boleh hantar kau belajar luar negeri
because macam our like surrounding countries like asian countries
macam for what
ah it's it just doesn't make sense to me macam
as in macam safety
and also macam when you settle down obviously macam you have family education here is much more better
much more better eh much better singlish betul
tak tahu ah dia orang nak relax ke
ya I think honestly I think they just macam nak that like macam kampung kampung ya they just want that ya that kampung vibes honestly
but my dad always like wish that he has a kampung to go back to
ya but I don't have but I do have like macam
um apa malaysian relatives lah then when we visit them during hari raya or whatever but now since like COVID cannot visit them
right macam okay lah
I think dia macam just nak experience not for youtube I think dia memang you know sometimes you have those kind of people that just wanna live off the grid
ya I'm like macam don't post lah if you're living alone quite dangerous what
you know what I mean macam any people can like if they know where exactly you're living like ya so scary
but berani ah dia tinggal kat kat hutan
probably ada apa permit ya
masak ah kat rumah mak kau suruh masak kat rumah tak nak
I I don't know ah for me macam aku tak suka um
but I don't know ah macam
western but macam I don't know
ya but europe macam quite dangerous now right ya
mm kalau I mean like
ya and the country also macam is it easy
but like like I said macam religion is the most important part lah so macam kalau
aku boleh like beribadah
but as in like he's he's okay lah gatal
guys kelakar or not
like macam he recognises the fact that he needs to relate to his audience
rabak seh
damn rabak
ya and then macam
ah best friend dia
I don't know but they say tottenham ada chance
but I don't want to jinx it to be honest because every time macam the fans cakap oh macam eh kita boleh menang abeh like always something else happens
and liverpool oh and also liverpool ada banyak players injured
so I think right macam this is a good time for other teams to step up
ya serious and like if they don't macam it's just a waste
see tengok man U is fourteen in premier league
jap aku ada extension
kau memang itu uh I mean do you subscribe to premier league

oh okay kesiannya
oh sedihnya
tak nak join ah
takpe lah
hey lah how are you man dah lama tak jumpa
really really long time semenjak aku last jumpa you right so how long do you think kita dah lama tak jumpa
no I think kita tak jumpa for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right err last year when do you remember bila dia start
COVID bulan sebelas COVID bulan
okay COVID november ya so I I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so dah lama gila
early last year you know what what I can remember from my memory aku rasa is that
aku baru balik daripada my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that kita dah tak jumpa lagi for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
err my mum bilang aku yang nurul is pregnant was pregnant and then after that eh
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and asal kau tak jumpa dia
and we used to be very very good friends semenjak kita orang kecil lagi
lah you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time kita orang jumpa I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet abeh kau nak berbual english pun dah susah kan
err from my memory is that we went for apa tau performance ya you know that that was like some bengkel kanak-kanak or some do you know remember aksi mat yoyo when we used to be there was remember that show aksi mat yoyo it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
err we met up at mak long punya okay so mak long aminah suriga is the like the producer for those kinds of err shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes pasal dia it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know
mm mak long
then kita orang and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so aku I remembered that ah kita start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are kawan baik
aku pun tak tahu how they became friends eh yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you dulu
rumah mak long correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows dekat err bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam performance and then I remembered doing shows kat situ with my sister dengan your sister dengan you together so it's sriwana yes yes you see now it's all coming back
yes I think kita orang were quite active in performance because I remember um quite vividly there was this particular show kita orang semua nak kena remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a kebun is it kebun in malay
engkau ada topeng lah but I do not have a topeng so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because lembu kan ada horns right so I need to be a lembu with horns so what I did was during the song of um old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing dia orang punya topeng
kita happy go lucky just go with the flow mak cakap apa kita buat then after that jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu then just joget
you were a duck I remembered kau itik kau itik because they had if you remember there was this disney nya itik
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya ya ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be err not confirm just to be sure lah kan kita orang ni iya lah kan
err I remember that you were donald duck and kau joget macam biasa lah you were happy confidently you know yes
err you were itik okay so
lupa ah so err the next memory is bila aku dengan kau we were in your dad's car
baru balik daripada some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right kat luar some lah community centre dulu dia orang cakap apa ah
ya ya ya we all so it was it was actually quite err at that point of time I did remember that kita orang we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then I I I remembered that err we were doing good stuff lah which we did not know was good at that time
ya err aku pun ingat yang that that we get to perform then after that balik so getting back to the memory yang in your dad's car aku ingat bapa kau because your your your bapa was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam
okay cool cool but I remember kereta tu kecil then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right right so every time kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke and so we were at the back dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like oh so we made so much noise that the the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now kita dah tua ni kan it was very it was because it happened by mm ya so I'm not sure okay so your
pasal your bapa suddenly pusing belakang then cakap can you guys stop it or not
so I was err you know I got quite scared of your dad daripada hari tu aku macam eh hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these lah and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes aku rasa
maybe dia bingit ya I mean we kita orang deserved it seratus percent we deserved it
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know err I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that nak bilang kau jer that was a memory ah ya your turn
I remember those moments of education yang aku tak
really oh that was so sweet of you aku feel so err yes
yes aku terharu orang cakap so
really pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa
engkau bukan seorang ya
oh I remember I know where you're going with this I aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda
ya I I I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well pasal aku ingat at that point of time kan you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle ada tank warna kuning it's a bicycle with a yellow colour tank then lepas tu ada seat kat belakang
untuk kau duduk then after that that bicycle kecil tau tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang each other it's a chopper
I I I I try to describe it ah so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are tengah hisap rokok ah
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any macam dustbin tak kan
it oh ya yup yup near our house ah ya the one opposite our house kat rumah bawah block farhan if you remember correctly
salah brother love
john J A B C D E F G H aku pun tak tahu
ya I aku understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then kita lupa nama dia and then after that nama dia apa then we will go through all alphabetically just to try and eh he looks like a john you know oh ya ya he is a john so we I I go through that thing also I believe apa tau lah like they did err they did a study about this dia orang cakap apa tau siapa yang dulu um buat show dengan mak long gitu
mm siapa siapa the kids that buat show dengan sriwana so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if err if you know like if I get to see her eh mak long hi remember me she probably wouldn't pasal ya
ya you can say that I have a janggut it's okay because I I saw you staring at my janggut and aku realise yang kau tengok dengan macam
ya ya I mean like to continue the whole janggut thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do kalau if you don't mind janggut ni sebenarnya apa tau if for me kan aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas
aku malas mm
ya because I realise bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk
ya but gemuk is okay because you know err I I don't mind but
like I am one year younger than you if kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka jer nampak macam ten years older from you and of course aku punya attitude is very mature
err yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other kita akan jumpa each other bila err macam nak balik sekolah so kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan thing sometimes
okay okay I I try to I try to from my memory lah because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so err what happened was err after primary school kan pergi secondary school tapi aku went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from yishun you see I went to saint andrew's school err which is located dekat potong pasir so jauh ah saint andrew's kat potong pasir so saint andrew's dekat potong pasir err aku had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school kan mula pukul tujuh setengah
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty pagi then after that make my way to school by taking the or the bus so I start my journey probably around pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah then after that
normal timing correct so during that point of time we jarang jumpa each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
dekat dengan kau punya rumah so which is northland secondary school
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because err there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking kau punya pemandangan kan
that what you must be like terkencing dalam seluar eh
confirm kena rotan with your mom confirm kena rotan with your mom I remembered because your mom is err your mom is very strict err woman from bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam quite err err how to say how should I put it eh verbal
ya she's she's fine with me I I I I actually you know what I I love her until now because sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih best friends you know I mean I mean not as close lah because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that datang balik fade away datang balik but I I appreciate the
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my mak aku punya birthday ya and guess how old my mak aku is
mak aku is sixty six years old lah that is err there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for bulan puasa punya time
bulan puasa punya time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or kita pergi sembahyang jumaat
yes so we did lah but not not not for a very long time lah sekejap aje kita lepak then after that err I bumped into your dad
err he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said eh uncle err how are you because your dad always speaks in english then mak kau berbual melayu so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
ah then after that um ya so um your dad aku jumpa dia then after that err you did ask me this question before eh bapa aku umur seventy almost almost eighty years old kau cakap gitu dengan aku then aku ingat macam eh
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda tau
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad lah my dad will exercise tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke he should be at home or dia keluar rumah
amazing macam bapa aku juga my my dad will wake up like early
but tapi you know looking at him stretching aku rasa he is still you know quite active in that sense pasal sekarang
err during on his birthday right two years ago I think aku belikan dia basikal for his birthday present then sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar as often
ya rather than to just stay home watch blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now kan dia orang dia orang kasih err facilities for the old people untuk dia orang workout
correct ya yes correct correct so err what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to masuk class ah join a class yang singapore punya funding
I forgot what is it called future or something like that skillsfuture ya so dia orang ada this skillsfuture punya thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some err security course so ya so
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards bila kau nampak kat condo then after that eh uncle how are you
okay lah same same lah like yesterday also takde ubah sama aje like that lah
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking pasal kita orang punya growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road lah sekarang
yes yes that's a good segway actually because um I mean it it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially pasal aku realise engkau sampai sekarang masih macam err doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still buat kau punya music semua
hmm okay err is it it's due to the whole COVID punya situation sekarang kan
oh you do err facebook punya session like live punya session is it oh that's cool you know what I found out that err one of our friend's apa ni boy cazly because I did meet up err met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time lah so sekarang dia
when we hang out that time dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook punya account I am not a
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information daripada you know the social media but untuk aku I
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time macam
the reason why I do that is just tak banyak sangat information coming in from left to right too many points too many um you know opinions from the social media dia punya community
tak I don't know kalau does that make sense to kalau aku cakap I I like to be alone and I'm not lonely hmm do I have an imaginary kawan
okay so like basically just to be updated dengan dia orang ah
so what you're telling me that you have like err you have you are talking about facebook right okay so dalam kau punya facebook tu you post like funny funny things
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you pasal engkau I I I realise I mean knowing you as a friend for for a very long time you are very positive err person seseorang yang positive lah senang cakap
because how can this guy selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada jer macam funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer I will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang whatever oh so then you know that that's just me but for you right I realise as a person and I really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya pasal sekarang ni
you know there are a lot of um negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube I do go to youtube though tengok comment comments kadang-kadang video video guitar lah music whatever so there I will I like to read the comments because they are just
ya ya ya this is relative to dalam bidang kugiran music selamat hari raya kepada all the people in singapore
hmm I'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful kepada diri engkau
actually aku pun aku pun suka orang malaysia lah but depends orang I mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person macam mana kau treat orang tapi orang malaysia pasal aku ada banyak sedara my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes
my mother is from penang my mum is from my grandmother is originally from thailand so what happened was that err dia orang fell in love then after that my grandmother and my grandfather err ran away dia orang lari kahwin lari
kahwin lari so daripada penang tu aku punya datuk macam this is a true story ya this is a true story so err what happened was my they fell in love I don't know how maybe under a tree then after that err datuk arwah datuk aku
yes so err that's the maternal side um my mum's father lah so err arwah datuk aku tu
dia I think he was from thailand also
okay I'm not sure oh no he's from like like descendants of india or something like that lah gedebak gedebuk then after that err they fell in love
under a tree bawah pokok then after that balik lari pergi ke penang for them to get married
wait let me get it straight nenek kau punya kakak which is your
wow that is banyak anak untuk tujuh belas is a lot of kids lah tujuh belas is that's like a that's a factory plus reserves ya plus reserves wow what a woman wow so this is your grand aunty right
memang banyak ah they have like you know like banyak
ya so seventeen is quite a number aku rasa
of numbers so err back to my my my grandparents then after that they got married then err they stayed in penang dia orang duduk kat penang then after that my at one point of time my grandfather like went to singapore and he got a job here in singapore where he became a policeman also something like that I'm not sure aku lupa
then after that err duduk dekat err barrack police err together with my father's father which is my paternal grandfather ah so they became best friends they became best friends then after that my err my mak aku dengan bapak aku
match is it how you is that how you say it matchmake ke apa
matchmake melayu cakap apa eh kalau matchmake melayu cakap apa
kahwin kahwin kahwin kahwin yes kuih kahwin kahwin try lah kuih saya kuih kahwin kahwin married married okay um so so so they they they were matchmake then dia orang kahwin err then after that a few years later dapat kakak aku
kakak aku is currently dekat hong-kong sekarang as you know then he she has her own family kat sana they're happy over there they plan to come back actually for december lah ya they actually bought the tickets and everything then lepas tu err because of the whole current COVID situation dia orang terpaksa cancel dia orang punya flight lah
his name is a tricky one lah err pasal dia pasal bapak dia is a french dude then my sister is malay right so um
nama dia is luq L U Q and then after that ada L U Q luq luq luq
kita orang ada luqman orang melayu ada luqman ya so err
luq lucien so that lucien tu is very particular pasal orang french kau nak kena pronounce dia orang punya language in you know because they they they love their language so much it's and I agree that it's very sexy language aku memang suka bila orang french berbual
you know pasal tak kisah lelaki ke perempuan ke orang tua ke orang muda ke the language itself is just
very sexy it's not beautiful it's just sexy hmm so I like how they they pronounce err stuff and the way they talk especially bila dia orang dah start berbual french abeh nak start berbual english lagi sexy lah but let's not get too deep on the on the sexy part nak kena
okay music part oh so okay sorry you're you're you're done with me ah with my family alright I guess aku rasa aku punya family tak interested tak interesting aku rasa okay ah berbual pasal music ah no lah nah I'm just I'm just kidding that's why that's why I love you lah because you ah whatever mean things that I think is quite mean and then when I say it to you right you
you don't mind and you just brush me off with a laugh and whatever and I really appreciate that some people kau apa ni berbual pasal aku punya keluarga macam gini you know that kind of thing ah
terbawa-bawa terbawa-bawa abeh balik rumah then after that they will scream in the pillow
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to macam apa yang kau berbual tadi
roughly um you know um err as you know I'm working from home right now right so aku ada banyak time kat rumah then I could been listening to no at first I bought a I bought a guitar I don't know guitar apa nak beli you know this is this is a typical um you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just pasal aku ada banyak time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes lah as you know aku dulu main drum asal it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated oh ya you do
yang penting kau terror wow that should be that should be your next err malay album punya yang penting kau terror
dengar lah kita orang punya record baru which is called yang penting kau terror
ya dan sekarang aku main guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication nak kena invest kau punya time main guitar and you and I I have to say I start I started quite late lah I started quite late then after
I when when I get to know you again during the secondary school punya time at the point of kan kau dah start main guitar you know and all this kau dah start main cranberries kau dah ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and aku pula when I was in saint andrew's school kan aku belajar drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then bila kita masuk band together we had a few of our friends then kita masuk a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
yang penting kita terror yes just like your the name of your future album
ya yes pasal okay err the reason why I got myself into the whole which is electronic dance music pasal
at that point of time kita orang punya band dah tak ada lagi then after that kita orang decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives gedebak gedebuk so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to um dance music
some techno punya stuff some err defected err record stuff which is quite cheesy lah to be honest with you like err they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor punya beats macam that kind of music so mm
so aku dengar um techno aku dengar tech house then there were few other house punya genres ah so they they had err like like like different
genres like sub genres ah within that that genres so I listen to specifically macam tech house deep house that kind of thing so err it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
err I had a I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started then after that kita orang dapat a few gigs kat sentosa dapat main kat club gedebak gedebuk we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect kalau nak buat music tu I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a and to mix like
a a disc jockey dia orang punya kerja ni is to mix err satu lagu dengan satu lagu
so dia tak ada stop ah
yes for so for example macam ada satu lagu if he's playing in turntable A right so that lagu belongs to an artist correct so from my err end of it I would like to produce my own track I I would love to have my music in the in the playlist
lagu original it's preferable lah you know you know that's the reason why like kalau nak have a band to play err like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have err you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so aku rasa that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya chord belajar dia orang punya style of music
in that kind of genre lah in that kind of context mm ya I mean the whole thing for me aku rasa tak
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was ya I was playing in like um in sentosa which is an outdoor punya outdoor like
disco discotheque mak mak cakap discotheque kau pergi discotheque tak ah pergi discotheque ah mak
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I I was the resident there for every sunday and then lepas tu aku manage to do my own company so I hooked up with err a friend of mine then after um together he was from america then we kita orang joined forces
err aku rasa aku wait wait sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa that was quite some time ago err so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then kita launched kita orang punya own party ah so then we had we fly in the we flew in their to play gedebak gedebuk then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created I created art not say I created I mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment err value to singapore which which is at the highest standard err at that point of time then kita orang
buat duit apart from that you know we err charged people at the door kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat bar
so we managed to make err money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail dalam tu then ya lah
err now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing aku punya guitar
out there in the youtube world sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam youtube you know
it's a mood it's a mood dia tinggal dekat uh
oh itu jauh babe jauhnya ya allah
and then yes nak try sangat ah try dua-dua sekali lah
why not and so entah macam dah try dua dua dah cukup ah
dah dan rasa okay lah dah dah puas then I I
um cari jodoh cari jodoh who is next
I was like please please kakak you don't have anybody let me just try for for one hour

like I'm not the kind who superficially macam oh if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
no lah I mean sometimes dia orang K when I say dia orang serious kan it's like dia orang betul-betul serious want to put themselves out there
ya like it really just depends on your rezeki I guess
ah itu lah
oh ya ya ya ya but like first date you terus want to pergi trekking

then kalau let's say kalau kita bilang dia orang kan oh
korang ada chinese privilege or whatever kan dia orang macam
kecil hati oh mana ada mana ada korang korang ni just oversensitive lah
I pernah ada kawan ni
dia tak percaya chinese privilege exists in singapore
tak tahu because is is okay
so dia betul-betul tak percaya tau chinese privilege exists
habis dia dia buat this long twitter thread pasal
it doesn't exist pasal oh um
budak-budak melayu tak bayar school fees untuk sekolah it's very very cheap compared to budak-budak lain
dia betul-betul usaha tau untuk
it's uh uh oh my god when I read it I was like K lah buang masa jer lah I baca tak ada apa-apa it's okay thank you very much
so kesimpulannya
awak a'ah yang
tak kisah pasal um
I think like dulu um
thursday asal

kita orang yang patut dalam this cage sangkar
sejuk eh dua minggu lepas
err I pergi river safari with my family
boring to be honest uh is like the word like it it was kind of dumb cause kita orang kena bayar
untuk masuk the boar rides five dollars
they don't have the crews anymore so then the boats then kita orang pergi naik it just like a short it's like macam
ya kita kena bayar five dollars but besides that everything is like
kai kai masih makan jumpa makan makan makan

the whole time dia just makan tau I was there for a good ten to fifteen minutes I just watch
eating and eating my god dia orang cute gila
uh apa tu apa tu kucing and also you know those macam couple couple buat video
no it's not it's because kita orang asyik tengok some videos pasal couple couple so the algorithm just
macam sedih kan
ya but like I feel sometimes dia orang post benda yang
should have just kept it to themselves macam something not everything other people should be
like something are just so intimate macam I recently saw this video pasal
oh um dia went through
miscarriage and then dia punya
teman lelaki tengah nangis on the bed dan macam dia tengah comfort teman lelaki dia I think
a bit dia ambil video on this stuff dia macam saja nak post jer then I am just like this kind of things in life are

oh my god that time my sister pergi kawan dia punya kakak
um majlis perkahwinan then it was cantik gila dia tepi laut and
it's it's not open dia bukan takde shelter it's sheltered cuma tapi dia macam how to say uh it's like kampung style open windows so there is a shelter but it's tepi laut
like it by the beach tepi laut kind cantik gila like dia punya deco and like the view
true true kalau nanti hujan masuk confirm mahal it's definitely mahal it's a it's a well-known expensive wedding venue no no K see I have

terima kasih kerana menghadiri um bersama

she very lawa
she I beli her using my own money you know my own duit my hati my buah hati my baby boo tak payah lelaki dah just you got a new laptop life's great baby
you didn't do anything the entire day so perangai lembu lah
perangai what
okay perangai babi then
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I mata potek or like orang Apple mata potek I do not know like I genuinely don't know
so now officially girl girl is broke I dah tak ada duit I nak makan pun tak boleh you know I was like thinking of buying like
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke apa lan jiao kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa
lepas tu I
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like dulu kan my mum pakai tudung
so like dia pakai tudung then kalau dia nak potong rambut kan nak kena pergi to somebody's house you know to tutup aurat and all that lah
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit lah but like raya have to go to their house cause it's like some nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya some shit lah
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to pakai tudung in primary school my mom brought me there lah instead of like the normal kedai barber and all that
since fucking primary six sampai last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to jadi dia punya
daughter-in-law dalam bahasa melayu apa
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously menantu material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her menantu for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her menantu you know dulu right when I was like like twelve nanti benda dia macam kecil jer ah macam she will be like
orh like what do you think of my anak like that like nanti aku duduk like dia kasi aku makan nanti dia cakap you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
um she like ask me like what do you think of #Adi#</P2 then I'll be like like apa kau merepek like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know
then after that like I don't know about you ah but I don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right I go and salam dia punya mak lah cause like I don't know why
then I have to salam the mum then
I salam dia nya mum and then straightaway dia punya mum was like
err kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua
huh sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila I'm like fucking nineteen and I was like
kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau and I was just confused you know I was just like
lady hold up hold up I love it that you love me so much like thank you I sayang you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point I have never even spoken
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri and then like he's never there
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year raya and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading ah
like I tudung and all that
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son kau nak jadi aku nya
menantu ke tak that that happened last year lah but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the menantu that's all
kan I don't know it's just like a melayu nya thing
like makcik makcik be really all up in your face be like kau nak jadi aku punya err menantu ke tak
menantu like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good menantu quality like
especially if makcik got a son that is like freaky
makcik I am permanently staying here you like me right can I get married now
you nak I sekarang tak I umur baru dua puluh tapi okay dah
I okay I budak uni
I don't know what else to say I budak uni
I suka masak
like I don't know what is a good quality to be a menantu in the first place
is it so that means what when you just register straightaway kau pergi primary one like you cannot skip anything is it
tak ah the only the only madrasah that I had went to was Andalus and then it was only until like what
so I go and boleh pukimak kau dia tak tahu ke
oh my god bodoh lah so the only vocab that he knows in Malay is
and like adjectives like sedap
and lawa
gila ya the jiwang kind of shit but then doesn't actually understand what's going on
oh no the motivation is gone padahal nak cari ilmu eh okay okay sorry sorry
like I solat I got clear skin I got good grades
it is scan scan tu eh
ah lepas tu
so wait he got he tunang in twenty seventeen he putus tunang in twenty seventeen and then he go and find her again
you know you'll never know might like still sayang and like I don't know like
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to berak then you don't want to berak first and then it's just like
I don't know nak cakap childish ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham sia
like first of all you are like freaking like twenty something and then you want to berak abeh kalau kau nak berak pergi lah cari toilet yang kau nak pergi kacau kau nya girlfriend cari kan toilet buat apa siak
kay wait kau nya boyfriend jumpa mak kau sebab macam kena caught is it like like terserempak kat somewhere then she's like no
lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
lan jiao I've been together with a guy for one year my mother tak tahu sia
actually I also tak faham lah
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I tak nak main main okay and then suddenly I tak nak main main equals to you kena jumpa mak I
so like I tak faham girl girl tak believe it
I just tak faham I was just like
was the one who told my friend like eh I want to meet your mak
I just tak tahu
like he's not the one that you marry and then korang like wah full blown invested like I don't know ah I I was just confused I never would
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend lepas tu buka bank account
sebab nak kahwin like they actually like
dulu I would do it dulu I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
and you know dapat
tell you so messy perangai everybody semua perangai macam sial
I really never tried blue coral my entire life but everytime a Melayu comes by
I never tried it before but like the Melayu right god like the typical like if the Chinese walk pass you know they're gonna be like peach green tea lah the normal milk tea the Malays if they come right jesus christ they're gonna make me do ice blended at the back and be like blue coral smoothie chocolate oreo
the ice blend and I'm just like alamak makcik like I know lah like
or chocolate oreo like you the melayu the makcik be like
I mean KOI punya milk tea already nice
huh why you talking about milk tea and I want sushi so bad like girl girl nak sushi tapi girl girl tak ada duit
why is sushi expensive like why like kenapa
like they come dengan beras
mahal lah but like
nya sushi
shit lah like the sushi at eh not Sushi Express what is it ah dulu at junction eight ada
oh yeah talking about your madrasah
at the start I went to a masjid madrasah for awhile only like
masjid Ahmad Ibrahim
the baju is green colour and then my tudung is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya telur came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow tudung really not cute
the sekolah is in the middle of like a hutan
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku you know it's like maybe I don't know
my yayi and my mum pergi ah pergi to the masjid and then after that they actually like found out the the guy that kiss me
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know sekarang I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
they will just say you know lelaki yang cium #Syafiqah#</P2 kat madrasah
you know dia literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my nyai will like talk about it to my mum
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama ah ada orang cium #Iqah#</P2 kat pipi and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my nyai to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a ulu place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my nyai
I cannot believe it ni perangai
bakal nak jadi menantu orang you know this is the perangai that it perangai
ya I almost said mertua this is why I cannot be nobody's menantu when I cannot even say menantu correctly
a'ah sia I cannot believe it that I actually took higher Malay sekarang melayu berterabur
berterabur baby berterabur
boy dia
mana lah aku tahu
like you nak datang rumah I ke tak you datang lah Mai</P2 lah is it
sampai macam gitu sekali ah like nak kena pakai voice note and all
cepatnya dia punya story travel
asal dia tak happy jer ke or what like what what's going on like is she not happy or like
wah shit sia I'm still damn salty about it like can you believe it sampai sekarang sia I'm just like so tilted
motor be like on the road malam malam buta baby who you fetching is it me I pun nak ikut
but really though naik motor is really fun like it's actually really fun
like the last time I naik motor was this guy who fetch me from work
oh wah not bad sia the job like quite chill for me I've been like searching for jobs because like susah lah like I don't know if what I should do with my life right now because I I'm contemplating between like design atau like just a normal working job like not design related
so ya then sometimes some of the elderly like they confuse with the dates of bila nak apa itu bila nak bila got the discount right so um sometimes they will pick a fight lah but like uh uh I'm used to it already they will be like eh today don't have the discount meh you sure or not ya then I like uh
oh my god kesian apa like I okay lah because my one like everyone was very nice though like all the uh aunties were very nice to me and like all the manager and supervisor they were damn nice like ya okay except for the weirdos but like because
ya I also got something like that because ah in we got the self self checkout right that you know the counter so there are times when you know some of the customers right dia orang tap they tap the card but then they never like wait so they will just leave
like that means the apa itu the the money didn't go through so ya then ya then most of the times right we have to chase after the customer and then sometimes right we cannot even like sometimes if we lose track of the customer then we are the one that have to pay for it because if we don't like
then lepas itu err this girl fadreena um I think she was like alone on the trip or what so like my friend and her other friend right they like okay lah I ask her to come join her also I mean join them as well so at first it was like okay ah
and then asked the friend to like teman her at her room cause her room is like not the same as my friend's rooms so she like sleep separately ah then after that right my friend was alone lah like she was left alone lah
like she say about my friend's height because my friend is very short mah so she thought said about the height then obviously my friend hurt lah then she my friend like we like how to say ah err like she kena back my she kena back fadreena then fadreena not happy so ya and then after that like it wasn't like their relationship very like ugh
like uh the boyfriend is quite old not old but like a few years older then she also say about that like what my boyfriend all like old what is your problem then like just cari pasal lah with my friend then ya ya like she think like the whole world revolve around her or what
oh wait i think I saw it was cause if tak salah it was on his instagram still right like the picture of them together but until now he haven't delete meh
the little actions he do I guess like fold the clothes all ya then I saw he also like apa treat treat her right treat her food all sedap seh ya I wanted oh my gosh three hundred it's three hundred
kau serious apa kau serious
ya oh my god it's scary though cause the first thing right dia kan engaged he's engaged and then now he's like what he cannot move on from rachel when he should be like focusing on his wife kan ya exactly
not really toxic relationship lah but like cause now I I think her life is a movie kan like a drama you know no serious cause she got two guys um so right now she's in a relationship like baru-baru jer lah the she apa itu this guy like proposed to her
but not like nak kahwin propose that kind of type but it's like uh girlfriend like will you be my girlfriend ya but then the guy is in so like now she's like thinking whether she should
so now she's like deciding lah I mean she still she loves her current boyfriend now but like to think of having to go through the next two years is also like a bit hard for her so if you are her what apa apa kau akan buat
that time recently I think was just this week lah uh they had a fight then because like my friend right she called the guy because after like uh dia dah at night right they can call already right so she call the guy ah then apparently the guy macam like I don't know why like bingit or something like cranky
the new guy obviously want to beat him up lah it's like really because it's ya like I don't know it's just a bro thing then uh apparently what else ah he got the ex got also like macam maki dia
maki the my friend ya like on a tweet then also wanted to make a thread about my friend but apparently he deleted it so I don't know problem sia ya it was damn problematic ya
oh ya I cannot I cannot sabar so I just watch every week
oh tak as in like for ratings right usually they say ratings is for like we watch on the but for most of us is like we watch on online mah so I think that's why the ratings not as high ya but
from what aku observe ya from what aku observe right it's really like that like every workplace will have that one guy who is tua
like they should look at themselves in the mirror sebelum dia orang nak prey on younger girls like seriously
especially those yang belum legal like that's that's like that's like a crime
burn burn the anak
ya like macam mana kau boleh buat like that to your own own kid sia that's so sad
no uh ya then they say like uh apparently I think either one of the mother or the the boyfriend was taking drugs then it's can also be like the cause of why they killed the child because you know when bila kau ambil drugs right then you won't like know what you're doing that kind of thing
wah so sad oh my god I cannot leh cause you got see or not if you scroll down below right you got see the gambar of the child
ya usually if like terbunuh it's like you the kid is like abused lah like like
no they never say abuse but like um they say she just they she killed the child in like february I think then like three months later then they burn the anak ya
ya then the kawan also like a bit bodoh ah go and help to
ya it's damn sad because like ah the father the the biological father of the the anak right uh was like finding the child but then apparently they said the mother
mm tak kasih tak kasih dia tengok or like tak kasih information about where the child is or what so for like five months I think the father was like finding the child and then end up the child mati
sakit hati sia ya
psycho sial gila sial this girl is gila like gila
aku wah aku embarrassed sia like legit aku macam rasa malu
ya it's not on it's not like apa itu it's not on like purpose it's on purpose ya it's on purpose then I was like wow how can you like put him in a cage all sia and the cage is like a a cage for cats eh not even for like humans or what
they got other anak you know like they they got like the younger siblings leh I think
ya like like those typical macam you know those malay drama right then got the the evil evil fella
hijrah hijrah fund
then uh bastard oh my god itu terus just pergi neraka sial itu oh my god uh
then ya I saw the syed saddiq also oh my god he always kena sial when all the older err ministers you saw the syed
ya that's what I want to say also like because they all like macam oh you must because I'm older than you right so you must respect whatever I say that kind of thing right but end up whatever they say is like really stupid sial like really
a'ah oh my god did you see the kanye mess oh my god I don't know what he doing sial like legit apa dia tengah fikir dalam uh otak dia sekarang
I should just go lah and spend two years in wah rabak pe lima tahun eh kena tunggu
ya like most of them never wear mask and also like I don't believe the cases really like zero in malaysia I I think there's more just dia orang belum report you know when they are sick
ya ah how is he a how is he even a president aku tak boleh I can't I just cannot
oh my god he's so like apa itu macam what's that word uh he's so calculative ah kedekut yes

tak ada kau kata like it's not um
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's punya race eh tapi at the same time kau kata like they shouldn't choose so
like kalau
okay kalau kau chindian kan like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial apa tu the quota that one right
cause like kalau this one
dorang dah ramai gila cina
so kalau kau chindian then kau identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
a'ah I I don't know if like we can jual like jual to melayu eh jual to india or not
then I know like you have to jual to like
uh it's like a social social inequality cause kita minorities selalu
okay ah I don't want to say selalu cause it's too like absolute but
uh banyak kali
chey dipinggir yes ya yes ya
ya dipinggir is like ah macam jadi outlier gitu kan
um honestly aku rasa
so aku rasa macam
cause kalau tak ada quota ni semua kan confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation ah cause like macam
kau imagine ah woodlands confirm kampung melayu sia woodlands yishun
yishun tak sangat yishun maybe like yishun maybe like chinese a bit ada indian aku tak tahu
eh eh kau takmo
yeah um abeh punggol probably
I don't know macam cina maybe
this like racial quota right is only applicable to public housing so macam all those like private private properties semua kan macam like rumah sebuah sebuah semua
dorang tak ada seh that's why like they can get away with all this like
ah like segregation so it's like in private housing private housing there's like the kau tahu macam dorm
that foreign foreign workers punya dorm so it's like
like ah for workers and from china semua they live together then from india bangladesh semua live together since like the segregation is there already and then also like in in like
um expats ah macam those orang putih then they tend to live in like bigger houses pe so there's the macam they are quite detached from our society
eh diam lah eh yes yes

ya kau dah baca ah tu
so beauty to me I would define it as personality and manners adab lah adab
mm okay look before kita start kan um
uh okay macam mana nak cakap eh um
so macam uh sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana
ten years down the road bila kita dah ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
um macam for example friendship lah macam kita nak buat kawan baru kan
err tahu tahu
inshaallah tak
okay okay untuk aku kan because poli poli aku lah macam what I can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
macam mana eh um define
my course banyak cliques tau then um in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation kan so macam apa aku observe kan
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is dia orang popular and then they are
macam for me uh in my course most of the cliques yang macam the big cliques right they tend to I mean they are closer to people um they
they are closer to people that macam ada good looks semua so macam
so it's very very subjective lah in terms of macam mana dia orang select uh friends and ya and how the friendship last till
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so macam teaching ke uh
ya design ke ataupun like social service ya F&B also then I think what is for me if I want to be an employer then I would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
it depends beauty macam
but I think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain uh like macam for example for female right they like males macam
the lelaki yang ada certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
aku rasa macam are we talking in like first first
um like kau nak share
okay uh okay untuk aku kan macam if I want to find a partner
then I would say beauty in their personality and mindset sebab macam
uh for me I place I I put more I mean macam macam mana eh my first first
how do you say it macam
uh for me to identify that person as my partner in the future I would uh my first check list is like mindset or personality so macam ya because macam
macam mana eh kalau kita uh kita tak
we are into only the good looks then like I said macam in apa ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so macam to me I will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect lah so macam mindset and personality so macam personality and mindset is something that your bring uh macam mana eh it's like since yang kau dah ada personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset um like
macam mana eh what uh your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods uh rather than your looks because for me I emphasize on the personality macam like for example ten years down the road kan kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita when you have your children then like if you
okay uh firstly memang aku ada watak a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly macam
uh memang high punya
dia lebih lawa lah ah
before we go to the next question I want to ask macam
okay okay best ke dalam topic of friendship kan
friendship bila kita buat kawan uh buat
buat kawan for the first time
to me uh in terms of boys or girls I would say girls sebab macam
I don't know whether boys I mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like macam their
macam the friendship is base more on macam
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly macam I mean
not to generalize lah macam like boys they generally talk about like
uh apa macam like topics that are not so emotionally involved I would say ya
mm actually for that topic aku pernah lah belajar lah in aku punya course if like
macam what we think is a society it's not like um good but then it's still functioning so
macam is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional it's it's called something functional something lah
rather than to have a society that macam everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of macam they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya
disanjung yes yes yes
macam content is it the content they deliver
they they apa tu they are attached more onto the expectation rather than reality
lain macam extra
okay so for fashion um back in those days macam nineties eighties kan
macam the fashion do um I'm not really sure because I don't live in that era but like the fashion mm
err yes based on pictures also lah then yes it's very laid back and macam
like I'm I'm not sure whether it's true tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan dengan the fashion trend you know so macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now macam
we have like the uh what the term E-boy E-girl then the uh then the what type of new dress macam hipster hipster so macam
mm so macam
the no um the fashion macam mana eh do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
macam is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so macam do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
oh pasal journey is it
apa tu macam um right now uh
macam mana eh uh so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is macam kau ada banyak kawan then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is um ada ada uh ada value lah then ada macam ada tempat dekat society but someone macam just dia macam apa seorang
then dia macam pentingkan not really pentingkan diri as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care lah so like what what you think of like um this society standard macam ya
that was jodoh seh
we ngam-ngam
and I think for our friendship also um we are not that judgmental like in uh between ourselves so macam
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and kita macam banyak advice each other so so like it's really something
the negative side there's uh society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself lah since beauty was so macam
ada okay uh ada kebaikan dalam kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung
mm so it's like full package lah macam good looking very humble also
but I heard okay so that one is um macam kita kirakan macam uh role model yang macam
someone who is err so macam mira filzah dia macam actress kan
western eh uh aku tak berapa tengok
mm okay then for ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam uh pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam in your own
macam those not as
those not popular lah so macam kawan kau
ke or like someone
yang macam dia lawa and very like lemah lembut and all
it's something macam
ya macam uh kan cakap pasal uh apa tu
deen and deen and dunya so macam apa tu dunya means like world lah so macam
dunia tak di akhirat lah so
so macam aku rasa macam sekarang like budak I mean not to generalize okay but like budak-budak sekarang is more
aku rasa macam sebab macam singapore kan dia uh nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa
so macam the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world lah instead of like the the uh afterlife
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those yang macam dia ada dua lah so macam dunya and deen
so like more macam be comfortable in your own skin
ya sure okay so kita tinggal like a few more minutes lah so like I would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
okay so aku start first lah so regret aku is to be the beauty standard so macam dulu uh secondary one primary six semua kan aku macam very uh very insecure lah sebab macam
kita ada influence dengan K pop apa so macam kita nampak woo macam lawa seh and kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua I mean kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam uh we are not there lah so macam ya so like what I regret was like uh
like aku terlalu pentingkan like kecantikan dari luar instead of dari dalam ya
um then jap
like I think message something like to to remind you during your apa macam uh bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat lah I would say
um the priority will be uh ke uh work live and
I think pressure in terms of like macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam marriage lah so I think
I think the pressure will be more bila kawan-kawan kau dah start to slowly get married so macam you'll feel very pressured so um my message would be um
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause macam to to to learn to prioritise
do ask ask to do macam-macam
err finish my practicum yay um I think semalam
cause I macam like you know
true true then macam how to say ah
uh so macam
in a way macam same thing as um
uh so macam meet client then um got assessment then lepas itu
then macam apa itu my office is literally macam just beside the units where they live so macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven lah
ya lah okay lah existing cases tapi macam apa itu
because sekarang macam buat split teams kan then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle macam cuma two units each lah so kita punya outside unfortunately macam banyak
err like we face shortage of manpower lah macam cause um this the err
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs lah macam two services so dia kesian gila lah like she has to run back and like she has to toggle between both
and at that time bila phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
so uh so then macam then she also has to handle the clients kan the office the the program that I am in and then the other program she err she also has to attend to the matters there lah so macam double work
ah so she kesian ah
then baru sahaja recently another staff left ya cause
it's not pasal itu lah like I think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
but I don't know lah kalau macam
err yesterday I meet up with the um lah then dia tanya I like kalau do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added lah if I want to come to the company and work then macam I don't know what program lah ada satu program ini dia hey just started up their office is in simei which is like great lah macam very near my house
I realised my tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila ya
full time lah macam err how to say ah they ask me to apply tapi macam a bit weird lah macam I was telling one of the colleague macam the colleague there lah the staff there there was like
then uh what macam um so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then I think the uh my my um the staff there cakap uh the is the one you are interview lah
then macam like so weird the is actually my technically my supervisor lah then then she on the first day I came in for my macam meet up session dengan dia and my reporting officer
sampai padahal they just want to get to know me better lah
so cute ah then she ask me lah macam like you can go this option this option then apa itu
um then she ask me if I want to continue working lah at the same place yang I buat internship itu then I macam err not sure lah like a bit too far lah but
I guess it makes sense lah for me to macam continue there cause I know the staff there I know like half the clients there
then macam in terms of macam you know blend in with the team gitu like they know it's going to work
I think internally adalah macam issue sikit lah cause dia dah macam cause ada change kan so macam the difference in mm apa power dynamics I guess much macam mm
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be macam less
err hands on but I think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program kan so macam dia um just suppose head of the homes is actually macam a bit restricted lah
haiya he's like he's the one yang actually main person to do the homes and everything but because um the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then macam like dia dah lama dengan kita lah she already do this kind of this job so macam when she comes in and station kan the office gitu kan so err I think he feels a bit restricted lah
ya ya can tell sikit lah
macam I think dia macam like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then macam cause he got his own way of doing things then macam like he doesn't think that we should do this but err in a way
uh then macam like ya then macam at the end of the day macam like I dengar two things ah like I think dia pun macam segan and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then I macam uh then macam at the end of the day dia cakap lah like I'm not trying to supervise you
but um this is how it's going to work lah this is how I we used to do it lah so macam I macam caught in tau
so like uh macam am I talking too much
ya macam like this client he came back from hospital then dia pakai taxi then he kept asking lah
lepas itu err I want to
err be refunded by for my cab then apa itu dia cakap
apa itu I put in a group chat lah where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
so then after I uh I got the message then the head of the homes came and then cakap lah like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then I macam like what what is going on
ya and then macam like it felt weird like macam apa
like dia orang punya procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
ya so like macam I felt a bit err and then still some more like sometimes
the like I'm macam
I guess macam dia orang treat me a bit like staff there lah which I understand ah macam like
I don't know how they treat their other interns but I think bila yesterday too when I met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like I she she thinks that they like I'm treated a bit like staff lah macam they they allow me to do a lot of things
I I felt like macam still terikat lah like if I was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things macam I tak check in sangat lah like I would have just check in a bit then I would have run with it lah but macam
uh macam as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so macam like I hold back and then like I keep checking in so macam in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client tidak ada
so macam two and a half months actually quite short lah
ada one satu grad dip then the other is I think um under grad but err it's her second practicum
uh so I think this company macam purposely they take up err
they tried to pick up macam grad dip yang pernah kerja
ya ya in the social service sector so that macam mm not train lah macam like you know uh
work etiquette ah work etiquette macam like organisation after awhile macam a lot of organization macam structured a certain way
and then macam there's like cause I know lah macam like there's policy there's guidelines macam there's to meet gitu so macam like I roughly know lah
ya so I kind of know lah punya mentality where they go they a bit
they are a bit macam
jaga muka jaga face sikit like macam they expect
I guess like macam when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast kan ya so macam some of them macam resistant some of them macam they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or macam the society or the community macam thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report lah to government or which is lah can trickle down to usually lah cause they always report to lah
so then anything raise up lah then blah blah blah nanti in the end turun to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so macam be miracle lah miracle workers then kita cakap dengan dia orang lah it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time dia orang pun tak nak someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
and then macam how to say
dia orang punya is a bit merepek lah at times I feel
cannot be that macam one case worker has to hold maybe around
err I think last time apa eh eighty cases
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer lah they wanted I think hundred I was like kalau hundred one case sahaja can be like besar gila because of their complications is are they
someone who is very minimal macam susah gila it's because like it comes and goes ah each person kadang-kadang this period they are okay some periods not and then also macam seasonal you see cause sometimes like
I I think depending on the timing like macam chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause macam I think macam
how to say macam it ties into their
so dia teringat-ingat the families ah or what how is your relationship with their family lah that kind of thing
you ketawa
for like uh macam reporting period lah ya then macam
but I think macam they try to push lah macam reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that macam is singular case work lah it must macam kita buat group work or something considered under the lah because macam
it's try lah they try to lah maximum I think thirty to forty lah but then nowadays ah cases macam complicated you the person itself is not alone kan then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so macam orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah
and apa
I might lah I I will I will look through the simei one is a new program it it seems like macam um a a duplication of some of their services so macam like
I ask them ah what is it about this new program that you want to start uh new siting cause macam I think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs lah
err I think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred lah so then what's the macam main difference lah between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very um macam apa exploratory
oh no no there's no need to itu I have to I apply the usual route lah
macam I'm not in the headspace to cari kerja sekarang
I don't know if I want to just continue doing my masters ke tak next year is like I I feel macam
it's not that lah I macam don't know where to go yet I don't know if macam is the place for me to do masters like macam after one year one point five years of doing grad dip kan macam like
is it a good place to start like to study lah macam their profs are good and everything but macam ada I don't know lah what I want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if I want to take up continuing masters in social work
uh I think I macam orang gatal sikit macam I cannot
think what about your current job yang yang part time how is it so far
so you have to be firm and you have to macam how to say
approachable macam like you don't be the too nice person is usually is all strict first
then afterwards macam like then they say you strict right then they respect then you come in and be nice
it's the little things lah you cannot macam force your way into it like macam like
whatever you say you keep to it then they will respect you even macam as young as two they will remember especially kids ah they will remember
alamak teruk lah ya
I don't know I I want to do it that time then I think I had to cancel my appointment cause siapa eh can't remember so I had it was a a clash then I tried to reschedule then after that circuit breaker then my mum pernah buat ya ya actually I want she okay sahaja
but I I tak
so I wanted to go again then I terlupa then a lot of things happen kan then ya you know orh this year is like a very um happening year for me
on monday tapi dekat mana
tempat itu jauh jauh seh for me
is it not the darah one right
ya my mum advised me to go for the darah one cause apa itu
ya so she asked me to go for the darah one she went for the darah one also actually
you my apa eh
I can't remember what my mum told me tapi dia cakap macam you can you kalau nak ikut sunnah itu you follow which day eh
no monday ke thursday tak ingat but definitely not friday ya
ah but she went for it but macam yang this one this lady dia buat itu the female one she she she lives in tampines ah then she she part time major
think ya ya buat dekat rumah dia
I tak ingat err
I book I book the itu then I
macam normal lah tak won't break your bank kind of situation lah
uh no my mum okay sahaja lepas bekam
at least you don't transcribe yourself I I was apa itu part of my assignment one of it is macam to do process recordings lah then I kena record myself with a conversation with a client
it was so cringey then I heard myself cause it's macam I pakai mask kan and then I have to macam analyse lah everything that I do with the client then I was like so uh I hate this I hate this like interview so long thirty plus
ya I know I think ya I think when I heard my uh voice macam like apa itu macam way lower then macam
uh macam
the normal normal high pitch I think I realised my voice is the lower register and then macam calm like more huh not calmer lah macam
then will be like kenapa hujan siapa nyanyi
mm no ah it just sounds normal to me ya I I don't know lah macam ada ya
I think I don't know lah macam something to do with our ears like usually when we
voice macam I think it's the um channel that they go into so macam when we hear our voices during our
apa itu using recording ke apa right ya it sounds weird net factor
can't imagine we apa itu sekarang what maybe they gonna do some space travel kan tak sampai ingat who is it ah the guy yang faizal tak suka itu no
okay okay can lah I don't mind cause technically macam it's either
macam no err no macam
parkway parade or like you know north east region gitu
actually macam ya in terms of connectivity macam cycling I think in the east is better
eh there is a dekat tampines there's a eco green park town
eh I is this the guy yang you were the one that ya the one that you macam not certain is it this one
ya lah it makes more sense lah habis itu ya
then sometime macam like kalau the girl moves into the guy's house is sometimes macam
uh ada lah fiction you pernah dengar
outside you and the mother-in-law macam okay lah bermesra gitu but
I think macam like entah what would what would I know also
tak macam ada like female macam ada expectations on us like we should tak kisah lah kalau you kerja full time couple like you're supposed to help out
at the house then macam like the opposite doesn't hold true if like the guy moves into the house like you still have
mm like macam apa itu
like you don't expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is macam financially sahaja lah kasih duit
but nowadays is like susah lah nak
I know which is like macam a bit worrying lah macam I think I tengah fikir-fikir because macam
like I also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause macam at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility kan but then also
like you shouldn't segan and not ask for help and then my mm then my parents dia orang tak nak macam they want to have their own lives lah they don't want to be like you know
it's like the only other options I can see is that I macam berhenti kerja sekejap lah jaga anak and then ya and then potentially you lose
uh apa itu credibility um relevancy to the the area that you are in then susah balik nak masuk kerja
so then also like your is lower then you basically rely on your husband ah and then macam a lot of people tell me lah macam oh what uh don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent macam like what is going on
ya but at the end of the day macam but if you is good lah kalau you only want to have like one kid sahaja but then kalau you want anak kedua ketiga then when is it going to stop
ya so macam
technically kalau nak masuk playgroup lah it's a nice timing to masuk balik kerja and then
I don't know lah macam singapore punya culture not flexible yet
so macam
which one oh dia
I only eat waffle but then I'm so full babe what what do I have to do oh topik topik perbincangan
sekiranya anda
oh ya I was watching record of you like this new drama of park bo gum handsome gila sia wah aku macam fuh to be that close with park bo gum doing his make up brother I want
he is with his short hair handsome gila sia
aku tak kidding okay that is my second wish
like live live a day macam how to say ah macam satu hari kau live as them
no they don't want to know shut up censored sikit ah sia kan lee dong-wook handsome sia
ya ya there's a wave thingy I think if I laugh then dia punya wave macam lagi kuat
she don't like malay I'm just gonna say it I'm just gonna say it dia tak suka orang melayu
apa sia

alright boleh
boleh eh okay so basically aku tanya uh whoever living at my place first to do this lah cause I thought need to do at my house
then I aku call siapa ham boy dengan uh I they technically live near my place what so easier so I call them dua dua tak nak buat
I actually oh my god I forgot to tell ham he told me uh dia nak fikir dulu
ah nanti kita sign up then wasted tak dapat macam mana
no is based on macam first come first basis
okay basically err my friend hantar aku ni okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
sekali suddenly she just sent me this lah so I actually thought this was a debate
ah so aku so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I ah call you lah uh I was looking for people ah macam ham boy
actually one of my friend who stay kat
ah very near right tapi dia tak nak
like I don't I don't get some people punya mindset macam
tak kan satu jam pun tak boleh berbual
oh my god teruk
merepek no no no seriously
ah actually aku call kawan aku ni pasal
bukan because the thing why they don't want ah ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
ah always any conversation we have automatic kita selalu mix gini mix gitu mix gini mix gitu
kita tukar question jer ah
tukar question
let me guess kau kene kerja for
settle down relax there K dah settled
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay lah tapi nak
commit and ah macam apa
ah but then nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita lah
six fifty nine I aku dah kat rumah
the fifty nine second aku dah kat rumah
so they talk about the dulu orang Turkey macam mana macam mana dorang settle hal
uh rumah tangga
uh musuh
cucuk belakang and all ah oh my god I tell you
marah sampai nak bang table ada serious serious it it was all emotion
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy macam the race to become first in class ah
then sekali come to primary five dah kerek kan two years in a row ah don't need study ah lepak ah
instead of the okay sekarang kita dah first in class eh kita focus jer how to be best in the cohort
so aku start bergaul dengan dorang be like them
lepak kat luar lah ah tak belajar after oral
aku main catching
ah prank orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari you know
past tak terjadi
but as annoying and cliche and you know like jijik as it is
yeah oh my god dorang punya cara berbual
some um country ah they you need to pay first know walaupun berapa critical apa dah nazak ke pe you need to pay first before the surgery happen
like dulu punya time ah
macam yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example orang dulu we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
dia punya masalah yang betul kan is actually apa tau
life hidup
macam life is so simple
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind ada je masalah
everyday activity lah bukan kerja ke apa macam K for me
nanti muak pe
and what jelak sama jer lah
eh kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi tau pasal sekolah
macam apa tau dia punya ayam doesn't look good dia punya telur doesn't look good
yang mana lebih sedap which one looks more appetising because for me
intuition that I can read people face so like I know oh muka gini ah gini ah orangnya
like oh muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini oh macam gini ah orang dia
so tak ah so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
I expected you to be a super mat rep
err perang perang kan
so actually alamak confirm mat rep eh fikir dia siapa sia
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the apa the headmaster apa
course head eh apa
kau confirm menyesal sikt kenapa hamizan tak ingat
what skill eh apa kita boleh buat let me see let me see
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
I mean I heard of it before tapi macam
so me and cyprus skip class kau tahu kan cerita ni
and terjumpa fabian
then you know his uh dia punya cara marah macam mana kan see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
takde lah
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops lah ni lah tu lah ni lah tu lah
ah definitely adalah orang nak beli laptop so I can them like bombard them
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a apa
so aku macam oh my god
points better like apalah nak jadi
kenapa lah hidup macam ni
it's for me is merepek ah like I I can't believe ah macam
K ah kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk poly kan what what's the point
obviously ah kita macam you know what
kita punya pathway macam gini jer
ya macam is merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit jer
abeh kalau kat rumah I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
precisely I aku it is
I find it super merepek
so it it made me like oh you know what ah so tiring ah malas ah
ah tak leh ah tak leh ah
abeh come by my house lah one once in a while
eh kim cam
pergi pe ons see you in five minutes five minutes eh toa payoh to woodlands
why your apa engine so loud
yeah I never heard of it before tak pernah dengar
kau tahu aku punya orang singkit sikit sikit jer singkit dia
but you have to apa
apply for like you need to queue wait for like six seven hours kenapa
kenapa ah
kalau kau tanya aku eh mm
okay kalau kau tanya aku this about
if they give us like pre before you masuk right
dorang kata if we pass we get two months off know
okay for example kalau soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
kalau basketball oh definitely ah you need upper body strength ah but that means
like I pay for competition semua
izzul kau jangan pass kau jangan shoot eh sorry sorry sorry
no no no K basically in basketball kan kalau kau main
so my game and dorang punya game tak sama definitely they are better game sense than me
not to my knowledge macam
dorang buat ni aku tak boleh counter
tak kira apa-apa lah
you know because uh you have to understand in Singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
correct so parents aku suka apa tau they like err
air bahasa melayu apa ah
angin tu wind
oksigen ah ni dalam melayu properly ah eh
oksigen ah the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
G E N oksigen
kau punya okay ah let me see eh
then tak tahu dapat dorang punya salary ke tak
dorang punya families kat overseas macam mana
book reservation punya
kalau dorang buat ni eh kalau dorang buat ni kan
dorang punya tracking system pun senang tau actually you know what implement to all shops
dorang buat gini senang nak track orang
untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai right
tapi satu masalah will be apa tau
okay lah playing sports and all is a different thing lah you need to you know move because like berapa hari lepas kan aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play takraw kat serangoon sana
because kalau if kalau kita lepak kat luar
ah kalau korang kat rumah aku ke apa like we just do our own things
Italy they have a very big hit all this macam tourist attraction punya tempat eh very big hit
so kau masih kerja
eh tu nenek aku
I mean technically it's my sleeping time ah aku switch aku punya body clock
after asar to subuh
now is subuh to after isyak
okay apa ni kau punya time tinggal berapa
sixty mine is only fifty nine fifty seven okay lah I guess kita end the conversation now lah eh
ya so the correct so the third year aku move out err then I was uh staying dekat my aunty's punya place lah so what happens is uh I was there uh for actually aku duduk kat rumah dia kan for very long it's about
uh I they gave me hints lah ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed dekat dia orang punya place for one and a half years ya one and a half years err my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way err they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then uh that was the the time where aku just uh you know just tried to just tried to to survive lah you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof lah and then I was you know so that was a good thing lah
correct so that was that was err err you know err at the end of the three years then err aku early this this this year ah first of january actually
err sometimes okay terms sometimes tak okay lah so that means macam um kadang-kadang she will invite me back tau macam um you know to to her to the family home lah but uh sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
um she totally changed bukan change macam apa ah so she totally macam uh you know she she's more err she she literally like uh tries to bother about what I'm doing you know uh getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there tapi uh aku rasa she I don't know whether she realise lah that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing lah so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me lah now err but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months eh we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
yes yes yes rimas rimas is the correct word yes yes I agree I agree
I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time ah whenever it I'm the same as you ah mesti kalau macam cakap kan mesti nak menang tau macam in an argument eh kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang so I'm always macam energetically fight back tau ah passionate macam fight back tau but nowadays kan macam I I don't know ah kenapa it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through uh certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so uh kita macam tak tak uh apa tu there's no more energy to to ah to to expand to to argue tau macam at the most pun kalau even if we don't agree kan nanti the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer lah you know it's just you know you just you just stop lah just you just don't don't don't speak lah but but it's something that I have always um like macam I I'm really thankful that um she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because err I I knew back then eh I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay lah you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because err dia pergi haji uh last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that uh she came back and err I think I don't know lah maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno tak yang the coklat Kinder Bueno okay okay I I tell you what's the relation eh Kinder Bueno dia punya chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it is it is that is that oh for me for me I can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart kan I will I will ah I will be very very uh macam adamant to to keep to my belief style ah so when when I and when I'm that kind eh you that no matter what you do right I will not change and I will not follow whatever you say I will just keep to my own ini but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing uh I will I will melt I will melt and I will just give in tau
so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience lah ya and then apa
I actually find them funny lah it's just like the way they walk lah aku tak boleh dok aku aku kalau tengok dia orang jalan macam gitu kan every time aku tengok like macam it's like eh it's like eh bro your one very big ah bro ya
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for punya apa tu uh yang yang yang ni apa we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was uh the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time kan so you ask me to apply for punya apa tu uh opening kan yang yang ala air steward
ya err I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about uh I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like eh come lah just just follow me lah you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat northpoint kat yishun
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area dekat northpoint dekat McDonald's and then kat luar and then we were talking about things like illuminati lah we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right um the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective tau which which means okay macam let's say for example eh I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand tau kenapa dia macam gitu
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so err and and and it was honestly right my mind ah is always a one track thing so let's say for example kan aku cakap okay I told myself ah I I want to become a pilot but err I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing lah so I I don't have that kind of err presence of mind ah to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
so so my my life in in this industry lah in this aviation industry started out with um with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room uh on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion lah because he wanted to become a pilot himself tapi dia punya eyesight err macam tak err how to say eh uh not hundred percent lah not not not not a six six lah vision lah so uh and at that time kan dia orang very strict kan kalau kau punya eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance dia lain ah ah tau yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right sebab tu eh they realise eh in err in err eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so dia orang uh they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot tau who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because dah tak boleh apa because you dah pakai you dah pakai glasses then that's that's it lah you you no more already lah no more chance right so ah so that was what spurt on my motivation uh and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in uh so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to err err start the flying course ah so that time uh they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents uh fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight macam familiarisation flight ah so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out lah dekat err kita pergi sana then after that apa tu they they brief us and then err they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that lah this was a very long time ago sekarang dah takde lagi tau
sekarang ah sekarang is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition uh even further because I felt you know ah bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight dekat youth flying club tau and this was when I was sixteen lah when I was up there it was such a different feeling
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet lah bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing lah that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that lah ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could tapi aku I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics macam science ah science punya subject kan err I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
uh it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time ah I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my uh my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so uh puzzled because did cakap apa tau
uh eh I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics ah but your other topics ah you rabak man you cannot make it why ah then I realise that but it was it was uh uh only way way way later lah then I realise that uh okay I I I actually
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally aku tak boleh bergerak I was just I I and I still remember that day was my uh examination my english paper punya examination and err I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now ah okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it recurred again ya it recurred again so uh that was another dent in my in my in my dreams lah basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know aku pergi ah punya air steward punya interview tu yang aku pass
err actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why aku tak aku tak dapat uh jadi err air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up lah how it all times ties back together
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation aku pakai ni aku pakai my medisave uh my my apa tu orang panggil
uh I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid uh pakai insurance ah macam my medical insurance ah ya err for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
apa working
ada ada sikit uh my mortgage kan every month is uh one point one K uh aku punya err they cut off aku punya uh eight hundred
so aku kena top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future lah aku aku aku I was thinking lah anyway that one is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me lah which is why I wanted a bigger place uh the other reason was because aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang ah all my baggage my
eh I don't mind man I really don't mind kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat it's just beside admiralty jer also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area kan and uh the it's only about macam five minutes
tak tak tak tak it's not it's uh it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential punya punya place ah
yes I was there uh okay lah it was it was uh it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is um when you are overseas eh err your how do I put it eh you you're considered as an expat tau so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration lah so that's the reason why um most of us kan kita belajar kat sana we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to uh apply with the local punya okay so right now right now err so okay so so right now what happens is this eh
so uh average lah it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level lah I'm not I'm not a macam senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of uh about four K about there lah about about uh thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed kita dah sign contract kita dah sign dok we even we even err graduated kita semua dah celebrate seh we went out drinking I mean
ah tak tak tak tak tak I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks lah along the way there's you know there's ujian there's setbacks there's uh
ya I know right macam nasib kentang kan macam there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before lah this phrase I know I know
tapi I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining lah you know in in every ya so aku I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to uh goes back on track and all that right uh I I'm pretty sure lah one day lah one day I uh you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it lah
eh it's a different skill set lah sia it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself uh being on the drone so when I see it I was like oh okay ya lah but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do uh uh that's relatable and that's uh you know but I think uh they they have already announced macam plans lah you know
uh they want to push us to become uh flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is uh back to normal again right uh I think you know hopefully lah hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old aku tak boleh ah dok flight tak boleh
yes yes actually you are right you are right I I agree tapi dia dia punya orang he's not a war err what you call it eh he's not those ya he's a very selfish businessman but he's not the type of war mongering you know guy that that
exactly you know he's very divisive lah dia punya talking eh dia punya words eh that he say uh selalu make people uh fight each other
ya but dia punya orang macam tak um dia punya words ah he's words are very unwise and also no wisdom lah I I find that he's very different from obama obama eh when he speaks eh dia punya cakap eh all his words eh um they are very substance tau they have a lot of substance
macam their their their thoughts lah
eh kau ada citizenship eh new zealand uh huh
ya bro that's why you need to bring the entertainment to you that means your home right will be your one stop entertainment okay eh but new zealand mahal ke eh tak mahal kan dia punya standard of living huh
ya but I but no aku rasa it's not that much of uh how do you put it eh macam I I don't know what the currency is like uh the standard of living and the cost of living over there over there but from what I'm seeing eh it seems that everybody is okay leh dia orang macam tak
but the house is not fully paid for macam mana
cannot travel maknanya dia orang
kalau okay let's say macam for example eh kalau nak pergi ah okay ah cannot means the custom cannot clear them
nak kena macam uh in in a advance ah inform them in advance kind of thing ah
asal eh
tapi if you will just the duit bunga kan dia orang panggil duit bunga eh but you you still accumulate apa
correct twenty four per cent dia orang ambil kan they call it apa ah
so macam very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
if aku ada pagi punya kelas then she have petang punya kelas then if have if I have petang punya kelas then she have pagi punya kelas then it's like you really boring
lepas tu it's like how to say
it's very dry cause sekarang tak ada hands on cause of the COVID so kita tak ada jadi hands on activity
then I'm like central ada macam
uh childcare kat dalam kan tapi kita tak dapat pergi and we suppose to pergi so now it's like really dry and like err boring and all we do is like datang school lah habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
but then at the same time macam best sebab
dapat jumpa kawan pe
dapat jumpa kawan habis like
we go eat together sometimes tapi macam sometimes cause semua tinggal jauh-jauh so we cannot
do anymore but then college central still do but now because ah recently ada like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless macam is online class tu pun online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
habis lepas tu kita buat powerpoint slides about the muscles all lah
but ah then actually tak do like any like that is kalau kita buat macam project ni kan
it is counted as kita punya participation mark
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot lah from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now kita tak boleh buat so we don't do anymore then we have like
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then macam quite senang lah cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you oh your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing kan pasal
each of the people can there's like uh over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final nanti kau your
kau dapat when nanti kau dapat tahu ah kau do like well ke tak then after that for my class like kan you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good kan you have the opportunity to retake your punya like test lah but then my class tak ada orang retake cikgu cakap like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module tu macam cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do kan so you learn a lot more to macam business more like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say macam
uh in macam experience through experience cause we do a lot buat macam relationship management lepas tu kita buat the time kita buat like kita punya individual presentation kan it just
we in right this is the frustrating thing ah cikgu just go just go through
cikgu just go through mana part yang kita nak ada buat assignment one dia orang tak ajar like throughout macam in secondary school they ajar everything what even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and dia orang bagi pun
uh is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like kenapa budak ini nangis then kenapa ah dia tak eh separate dengan parents jer then uh what kind of symptoms
so macam a bit dry it's very dry
business writing is more to macam you write emails letters
then is easier in a way because ada multiple choice
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then yang section yang lain cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
we are like like you said lah this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april oh we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like macam how to say
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab COVID
tak yang mana eh tak boleh keluar sedih and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
tak boleh keluar cause mana-mana pergi tak ada duit
so mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit kan
and then like ni then can think about like other stuff
but they want to tanya you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
do like I I I just like to get it over with macam
senang kan kalau kau
aku like I can do bila-bila aku nak I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
macam I'm a I'm a bad person lah I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like banyak gila is the amount of like group projects right is banyak is like until like every week you tukar group you've just tukar tukar tukar constantly you tukar cause cikgu first of all like
the reason they give is because sebab apa cikgu nak kita meet
work with people they want dia orang nak tengok how
speak english or like other ada apa language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
macam mana kau boleh cope dengan working with other people
kalau aku group yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat frustrated tau
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy aku macam noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done macam complete ah cepat habis cepat kau pergi relax cepat kau pergi like
one corner kau there duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi time kat kelas untuk buat project kau just duduk jer apa habis tidur
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like semua my project kan is die like hujung hujung last minute submit like eh but eh is good work lah we are able to provide good work but it's still
depends banyak dengan who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together ada like yang they are mm
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name ima cause he just talk malay cause he macam he's really a perfect
honestly banyak orang cakap is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
banyak yang senang like
senang for you to masuk senang for you to complete senang for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate macam kau yang classmate bo chup like serious like
tak buat kerja kan I mean kau do kerja yang you are given kau boleh dapat A even though gonna work is like so bad
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar math kau ajar one two three four five under ten pun sudah okay dah you are set for life in that career in that sense lah
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so macam
but then macam what they never think is that
really competitive you know like the other type that macam every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada like macam oh
they like the macam
they really think about their ranking a lot lah macam I know that some macam
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking lah but she's clever but rela also clever but she also don't think about ranking macam kita
sorry to say but melayu more relax lah
kita macam more like okay tak apa kalau pass pass kalau fail fail gitu tapi we try hard
tapi macam there are a lot more other races macam they are very keen on
macam competing macam hardcore gila ni semua kan so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning ah but we are learning it break we break up
more slower in a sense kita boleh more slow but
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school macam aku dah fail fail fail fail fail lepas tu bila kat the end aku macam okay pass macam I made it jelita bah cause I I do set expectation that are high
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up macam
I aku rasa macam very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
senang jer macam gitu then I'm just like oh my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
aku go into thinking that macam
senang like ni like it will be nak very easy
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid takkan tell me budak tapi tak nak observe budak tu lepas tu I nak tanya write report pasal budak tu then I'm just like oh my god I cannot do this
but dia orang ingat like macam ni senang cause kau jaga budak jer pe kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga but actually
we watch how the budak grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes cikgu yang responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then kita okay just besar macam okay lah by this age dah cakap actually there's a
oh I look back my slides right I'm learning ah I'm like tengah revise jer aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak and we revise okay that's actually link kita belajar pasal brain then kita faham okay which budak pakai which part of the brain when they are doing this budak pakai then we are just like oh my god we are just learning like
seniors mereka cakap from the first year
kau boleh tahu how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously kau dah tahu like you are like
macam it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly eh tak tahu apa-apa they don't know anything about budak-budak you don't know anything like
some people even like masuk early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how macam early childhood has
so end up you jadi cikgu atau jadi principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so macam that stability is what people want in life kan
dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
for the next few years kau ada job untuk dapatkan they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay aku nak pergi uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
I want to I don't know initially memang aku nak baca psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide macam belum decide kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam I'll pass macam how to say ah
poly obviously I aku tak nak just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
my friend said that in every like I was macam very when dapat pergi kan you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that apa tu once in your lifetime you must experience life
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but sekarang COVID so kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she bawa nintendo switch jer pergi class ah semua orang main just dance is like that kind of thing
all of us want to go poly semua nak pergi poly kita punya ultimate goal is poly
macam bila kau kat first day
dia orang tanya kau like um
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay ngee ann temasek ngee ann temasek that kind of stuff bah banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
macam susah tapi that
bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap okay memangnya it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
that's obviously true lah then macam very susah then I see you learn by laju so aku dah macam
oh my god I cannot take this aku macam dah stress I remember ah me thinking that when I do my assignment like oh my god is already so stress aku dah stress gila masa buat assignment aku tak boleh like sometimes kalau kau message aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku just macam
I cannot do this aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition macam I think itu yang susah transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in kat ah secondary school all these are the teacher untuk guide kau like okay kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni okay kau nak submit kan ni kau nak submit kan tu in kalau kau tak nak submit cikgu macam eh kenapa kau tak buat submit
ah kau nak submit tau next time tapi dia dia orang tak remind kau they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay ada exam make sure belajar tu jer aku macam what the hell aku macam come on man like
adaptation is how you are ah adapt let me ah I think most people tak nak it's understandable kalau kau tak nak
cause kalau kau dah badly adapt poly right kenapa tu like you kau tak macam you cannot get used to
macam I know ah focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like macam cikgu ajar one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner lah macam you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language macam mother tongue
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important macam but then now they are making like macam oh mother tongue punya base preschool semua kan but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words macam there are some things about ah what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's macam kat movie
like macam devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
punya like thinking how they make decisions macam mana then macam oh budak ni
like is like macam evil not evil lah
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then macam ah when we realised that it's hard macam susah
serious susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung just tidur I cannot take it aku macam kelas pukul lapan we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
kita back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you macam I think the
macam kau punya record senang kau record like how to say that time aku the whole way aku tidur like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so aku tengok balik recording okay macam okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff macam keeping balik cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap okay fine
it's just seriously hard oh you know macam now is
now like macam honestly okay at eighteen right ah when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
I have a older friend right aqilah kan a year older then dia she tell me macam tegur aku lah
what kind of people you want to mix around with kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan
cause biasalah cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and eighteen kan kau obviously kawan kau bukan semua ada boyfriends kan sekarang jer kan oh ajak kawan ada they're going out dia orang keluar kat boyfriend dia orang lepas tu dia orang go to the beach even kat COVID COVID ni dia orang text sahaja it's just like ugh I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation macam okay kau nak boyfriend tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay lah kau tak ada boyfriend
that's why I relax macam okay now I realise you know macam ninety percent of my friends that you macam
my close friend lah macam kau aqilah megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe hada you know she has macam ada boyfriend sekarang kan
takes a lot of decision tau cause kau one year kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak moving along with your life what dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah getting uh upgrading yourself in a way lah then kau nak you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
betul tak unless you have boyfriend lah but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
it's different ke so it's college lah so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan aqil kita plan lagi
ke korea belajar
then we're just like come on hada then she just said kita tak nak
she she doesn't kita tak nak how to say dia nak take a break dia tak nak continue belajar cause I don't think she prioritise
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys kita macam okay kita macam single sedih kan cause sedih tak ada boyfriend
sedih dan lain-lain but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy kan is bila dia bilang aku jer tau dia tak tahu apa nak buat into the future
I don't like aku macam god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like dia nak kena get dia life straight I like I find guys like macam tahu what they are doing in life right very attractive first
susah kalau nak like okay mm we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we macam get it lah but then macam we
who you are in life you know macam eh sekarang ni school decision um aku selalu cakap tau oh tapi some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are oh I'm like
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really macam put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
and then but the but then macam to me kan the
the aku punya pressure towards myself is lebih besar
so at the end of day kan I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because macam kau already
macam let's say I aku ada a lot of thing spent untuk diri aku aku ada like a lot of
I actually single best gila sebab kau first of all aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak
like aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang
how to say aku tak sangat
aku tak nak lelaki yang macam sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like macam macam I have seen a lot of my friends banyak bagi tahu aku apa everyday kau everyday jumpa
macam kau okay kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas tau
macam I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like ah you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like ugh like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
bila kau dah seorang eh
kau ada banyak freedom you know kau you can do a lot of things because now banyak of my friends that break up they are like oh my god
single is fun but after two months they're like oh my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then aku macam aku tak nak kan saya lelaki aku macam ah you know macam my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if kalau aku dalam relationship kan I would take it very slow
cause obviously aku nak date for long term
apa yang kau nak in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like aku tak ada boyfriend tau macam
most of last most of my last time my friends ada contact kan can go back with aku akan text macam balik punya eh ya aku balik macam but then when ah I go back home alone
I feel fine apa I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku jer tidur jer janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay kau nak you nak makan tak the I the best thing is aku tak payah minta not minta macam aku tak payah macam
like worried keluar dengan kawan lelaki boyfriend aku macam marah eh kenapa keluar dengan lelaki like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense bila kau dah free for too long
tunggu macam how to say ah
first of all you learn to love yourself back kenapa macam cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes bila dia orang break up eh dia orang kena dump they think that macam somehow ah what's wrong with me berapa muka soalan kau kan tang is like kenapa aku then you have to over that
like time where you like okay aku ni okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
kau just macam build up on yourself lah
aku faham ah in a way and then
cause fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri
then bila now I'm thinking like at the end of the day kau seorang jer during this pandemic I spend a lot of time jer I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
like bila aku dengar anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause aku just nak text all the time then sekarang macam I like brother and my sister they were sick ah what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam call boyfriend calling ni kau tu
family is important to me macam I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together kan kita macam really emphasise my dad my dad really like
how happy I was when I was with them thing macam
my family is a type macam
kau nak faham like kawan friendship semua
macam is not
anytime boleh end
walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang eh
kau boleh end kan tapi family kau will always be there with you and you need to understand because kau dah besar you are adult
adult you know macam
aku sekarang I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like macam ah she she like how to say
location ah phone kita like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like kenapa kau nak lock phone aku macam that kind of vibe you know then bila kita the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just macam how to say
my mum just like ah give me touch you punya phone
then kita kena bagi like my siblings just like macam uh tanya like they never ask
aku aku reply aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku phone I aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak hide
I have nothing to hide so aku just bagi
kenapa main kenapa cause he's always playing game
so dia macam very agitated tau so macam
and then macam kita dapat balik kita macam okay and lepas tu she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what tu bukan masa aku muda-muda tau tu last year tau sasha knew about this like apa tu
and then after that she always like lock kita punya phone semua kan then habis tu when family time she lock off kan I was like but we don't ever feel macam
cause like and macam kalau you
that app kan kalau kau pakai more than eight hours kan dia orang lock kau punya phone tu kau tak boleh buka so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause aku sahaja I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend tak tau it charge charge semua pasal kita just macam bond banyak-banyak bond
so macam aku I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila app tak ada kan then we understand now kenapa
naturally now kan kita spend a lot of time together a lot kita tak on the phone kita macam I say to my mum
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night kita watch the harry potter series as a family macam
uh like at eight after my that eight eh like all on my apa dia off day kita just duduk habis kita tengok harry potter like kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam it's that kind of vibe you know then macam but when I spend a lot of time with cousins kan I realise that their families are different
macam they don't really tak kisah sangat pasal family dia orang say
okay aku dah besar pe okay like now what eighteen
kenapa nak spend a lot of time with family
shazlin dia family tak pakai baju raya dia matching tau
dia beli sendiri so pakai different colour ah but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink eh
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay satu colour jer
then we buy like same colour and it same with macam makan tau like it's like puasa right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night ah last day usually last week kan kita banyak makan take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then bila aku macam spend a lot time macam
with other people and aku realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
they dia orang tak macam
dia orang tak macam forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always cakap why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
a lot so macam my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like macam every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this

malas betul aku nak pergi kerja sia
err what do you think boleh
is it wah just now also I sibeh sleepy sia I don't know why tapi macam I think cause the the err shopping mall was very noisy so macam tak boleh tak boleh concentrate ah so like like everything too noisy then kita pun nak dengar cikgu pun tak boleh then we have to lean remember we were like leaning in to try and hear her like and it was like
ya you all intended to macam invite orang lain or no just the two of you
oh dia datang pukul berapa
then you balik rumah makan eh
mm I like the the chicken cutlet noodles and the chicken cutlet apa tu curry rice
ya it's like just the chicken cutlet so juicy reminds me of that time when I went to punya apa tu dia punya Cheers store kan then lepas tu tak ada tempat makanan halal so I just went to the Cheers store beli dia punya microwave food then err the microwave food I I bought this japanese curry katsu rice
set and then it was honestly okay just that the the curry err the the chicken was like very small and it was I think because microwave kan so it was macam a bit soggy already ya so it wasn't crispy so I'm now I'm thinking about crispy chicken now ya
oh this morning I was actually quite happy cause err I woke up at what time eh like around ten o'clock ya then I was a bit hungry so tapi like err there wasn't enough breakfast for me leftover from my family so I asked my helper to help me cook
nuggets and french fries ya so while she was cooking right then haziq called me ya then then ya haziq called me so I was super super happy because like macam dah lama tak dengar dia punya suara ya so I so I was super happy so the moment I answered the call right
ya cause he wanted to take his laptop hashtag priorities ya then err ya so he he wasn't supposed to walk lah technically but like he just waited for dia punya nurse to close the door then he secretly go and walk to his bag to take the laptop ya then err he was really happy I think he sang like I think like almost ten songs seh
then like he sing kan sampai nurse kat luar semua sampai I think like around like almost the entire ward boleh dengar dia nyanyi ya so like but then the nurses were very happy lah cause dorang pun tengok apa tu dia dah how many days tak macam macam tak sihat so sekarang dia tengah happy dia tengah sihat so dorang pun happy ah
so dorang pun macam tengah motivating him like wah wah today sing a lot ah just sing some more lah okay don't need to wait for tomorrow just sing more now ya so like
alhamdulillah boleh gembira sikit ya my heart is like tenang sikit ya so that was my morning then after that like while he was talking to me his mum suddenly came in like she never in knock apparently ya so mak dia datang pastu dia kena hang up lah so pasal dia tak nak tak nak kena kena tangkap ke apa kan so then err
err then after that he still texted me lah like oh now today like a lot dia nya dia punya sedara datang ya nak nak uh nak visit nak tengok ya so he just like uh kena layan dorang ya then just now right before I met you he was telling me that like dia nak watch netflix on his laptop tapi bapa dia tengah pakai so he was complaining then I'm like never mind lah your bapa tengah
tengah doing work kan then was like ya doing work but ya lah it's okay I'll just use ah then his sister was also using his ipad ya so he was using and his sister was using the ipad lah then he also cannot use to watch netflix so now he's watching TikTok
orang tengah sedih kena makan comfort food then after that gain weight after that gemuk after that uh regret
semalam ya I went out to go to the hospital tapi I tak dapat jumpa haziq lah cause err dia tengah rehat so I just duduk kat bawah jer ya what about you
belajar makan eh makan apa kat situ
no I always go to the choa chu kang one cause I gym kat choa chu kang ya so sometimes after work I go to choa chu kang to gym but there's always a long queue ya so I will join the queue err I will join is an electronic queue lah so I will go there scan the code then err I will join the queue then after that err they will they will text you when it's your turn
gym box ya the gym box punya queue management system is like that
but err in like after twelve then after that I wanted to go gym ah then cause my gym dia punya bawah ada this new burger king then cause our area you know there isn't a burger king nearby so I always never I'm like burger king deprived you know me and my fast food oh shit yesterday I eat burger king today I eat nuggets oh damn
right because our house area tak ada burger king dah lama then this is the newest one
ya so I think next time like I would still recommend the the apa tu the mozzarella cheese burger to other people tapi kalau if I were to go back to burger king I'll end up ordering the swiss the mushroom swiss instead lah
then I park at this super far away punya car park cause dia punya parking fees very cheap it's like for one hour is like one dollar and eight cents
that is super cheap like that's the cheapest already normal price err all the other parking lots are like double the price is exactly double the price macam two dollars sixty cents uh sixteen cents ah ya ya but my worry cause I never went there before kan so
but when I went there I takut like because it's quite ulu
dorang cakap ada shuttle bus ah tapi kalau because I'm gonna go there at night so I takut like
uh kalau bilang nanti bila malam nanti nak nak balik kan nanti ada benda
right smack in front of the only lift there ya so the moment like kalau apa-apa ternampak cabut ya ya then like I think cause it was so ulu so when I waited a I parked my car kan then after that I waited for the shuttle bus kat bawah
ada like dua budak lelaki budak melayu ni tengah tengok jer probably wondering like what the hell am I doing there cause I think cause I was like uh macam wearing office clothes ish ish lah I was wearing with jeans ah the top macam uh like office punya punya baju lah
ya then after that dorang tengok jer apa budak ni tengah buat kat sini ulu ulu punya tempat
ya so I tapi tak kesah lah so like the shuttle bus quite reliable honestly speaking ya so when I took the shuttle bus then I drop off at where I was supposed to then I went to the makan place the kaki makan tu ya and I ate my favourite err what's that called the lor mai kai ya
then I wanted to buy dia punya what's the one that we ate that time oh dia punya honey barbecue bao the one that was very big and fluffy right that time we ate ya but this time dorang tak ada semua dah habis so they only had like siew mai and lor mai kai and the typical nasi lemak so I didn't want to eat so heavy for the nasi lemak so I just got the cause the lor mai kai itself is already quite big right
and I want to try the there's noodles also so like I reach there around six O five ya then err when I go there then I wanted to buy the noodles cause that time we didn't get to try the noodles kan so dorang cakap uh noodles the person who cook the noodles uh only available sampai pukul enam then I'm like but it's six O five
so I missed it by five minutes ya it was so sad but it's okay lah uh inshallah next time ada rezeki boleh dah makan
makan noodles dia there was this err it's a bit like ban mian ya it's it looks a bit like ban mian but like I think got like hot dog and egg and fish I think ya ya ya ya so it's like you know on like a cold rainy day that's the kind ya you just really want to makan ya like you just craving kan
ya so I just like I wanted that was the they say like all the noodles like the the cook dah dah balik rumah lah so I just like okay tak ada rezeki then ya then err ya then I ate there then err the person I ask the person whether can I stay there for a longer period cause by right dorang tutup uh pukul tujuh
eh pukul tujuh eh pukul tujuh ke pukul lapan ya something like that ya but then I wanted to stay sampai kul sembilan ah tapi dorang cakap dorang tutup sampai pukul tujuh pukul lapan gitu tapi uh they allow me to sit dekat luar dia punya outdoor seating so it's not really outdoor lah it's still within the building it's just that it's outside the shop
ya macam in a way communal area lah tapi ada meja so okay lah so I makan there I duduk there sampai pukul sembilan gitu then after that I just went home ya I went back to the shuttle bus ya wah ya the shuttle bus was so hard to find like err cause it was a loop so I wanted to go to the other end of the loop ya but then ya it was so hard to find and thankfully
ya but alhamdulillah ya lah okay lah tak nampak apa-apa then I just balik rumah jer lah
ya I think so we still have like macam forty minutes to go
this is the kind of weather that you just want to hide under the selimut then after that you just sleep ya sia it's like so windy I hope I hope when we play the badminton later it won't be too windy ya but I think even if it's windy I think I will still be fun lah
ya ya tapi I saw kat sebelah dorang ada roller the want to roll the floor err when it's wet ya so ya it's not effective I must I must say that first as in how to say it's not very effective but it helps with the drying ah pasal it like last time when I tengah main netball kan I always use that roller to spread out the rain
actually no I wanted to teleport so I can go all over the world and like you know lah I like to travel the world kan ya so like if I teleport I don't even need to go and flights I don't need to pay for flights and technically I don't even need to apa tu
err stay in hotels also cause like I just teleport home tidur one night then the next day teleport to greece again or something like that ya so okay lah ya okay I need to aim to be like you
ya I I saw a few videos on it lah during during circuit breaker cause I mean during circuit breaker tak ada apa-apa nak buat kan ya so I just duduk rumah tengok video like in a way very sensitive content just tengok jer ya so I always get that then like like honestly right when I hear that it makes me happy but at the same time sad also
to be called a smart malay I'm just to me I'm just right I'm just trying my best that's all to survive in this singaporean society and I think to you whether you are malay or chinese or indian ya like so the fact like when when people tell me oh you went from then go to wah smart ah then in my recent job interview pun dorang tanya oh I think your academic background is very good
ya so like those err from what I understand is more of like those people yang dorang nak lari dari rumah uh dorang punya mak bapa selalu tak ada kat rumah uh apa tu maybe maybe you might need financial assistance all that pun ya selalu gaduh kat rumah and all that gaduh dengan kawan gaduh dengan cikgu that kind ya so err that is what apa tu Mendaki is trying to do lah ya this was err last year
you have you affected them so much that they change their lives around ya so that's what I wanted to do lah so I want I wanted to do that so like when I went to the interview right they were the wah the interview was like what like dua jam siol ya so ya so like I was talking for so long ya err I mean cause they want I think in a way they really wanted to get to know dorang punya volunteers
ya just to make sure that like you know in terms of adab in terms of your akhlak semua uh boleh pass lah ya like macam there is no macam red flag ya so like because these are people like the people like the student that we will be dealing with is like those people yang betul betul need help ah ya so like if you teach them the wrong thing then macam err Mendaki has to answer in a way lah so I I understand where they are coming from
very english lah like not not queens english but like I concentrate more on english and my malay was terrible kan ya but then now I mean I am improving lah in a way in my malay err language exposure ya so like when I err my my question to them was like I am macam in a way
like will they want to even listen to my advice or will they even want to like they probably cannot relate to me lah like your just be like your problem is different apa kau kan anak-anak orang kaya that kind ya so that was what I was afraid of lah my intention was to help them tapi kalau orang tak nak apa tu uh they don't want me to help then
ya so like cause the the mentor always like I mean like always rushing to school rushing to work before that right ya so like he didn't realise that the kid was sleeping at his void deck and he didn't even tell him ya so wah I'm like wah if I were to be in that mentors shoes right what would I do you know like I cannot imagine myself doing that so macam to be honest in a way I just lost confidence ah like in what I am able to do
ya but recently some of my friends have been asking whether I want to join or not ya but I don't know still thinking about it right now my life macam still huru-hara so I need to let it get it settled first lah don't spread your eggs in two many basket ya too many things man
like it can be a controversial opinion tapi macam
mm ya and I feel like that like free education right will only help to a certain extent ya I think like underlying problems such as macam maybe social and familial situations ya so for example like those
those students like like let's say they have problems at home like in a way their parents are getting divorced ya then macam dorang tak boleh they cannot like how say is very they can overcome it definitely that is is not impossible but it's still very hard lah like you know like how they say equality versus what ah equity
jom kita bercatch up
sekolah kau macam mana ah
jadi seorang jurugambar is aku punya impian actually
tapi if I were to
like menyerah my freedom cause kan being a being a photographer is like a freelancer job
tengah cari ni tapi aku pernah ah satu kali aku um aku photographer cousin aku punya wedding actually
nasi lemak ah
okay ah kalau aku kena makan one dish for the rest of my life
aku rasa aku akan pilih makan pizza
pasal pizza tu filling pastu portion dia macam besar
okay ah not bad boleh makan for the rest of my life tapi the downside is aku punya health akan deteriorate rabak
pastu like the most memorable meal for you leh
oof aku pun nak pergi korea sia
eh hari tu aku baru tengok movie tau keluar dekat pawagam cerita dia pasal time capsule
so macam
aku terpikir ah if right you found a time capsule ah from long ago macam ten years ago gitu what would be inside your time capsule ah
ah ah eh kau dulu art major in secondary school terlupa aku
what to do kena kerja for a living but right terpikir juga aku if manja tak payah kerja lagi for like a living what do you think we will do ah
tak akan depend on just our government kita punya government bankrupt juga
so like macam
kalau macam gitu apa macam susah apa yang kau harap macam free gitu
healthcare tu susah juga ah kalau nak jadi free
education pasal education sekarang walaupun ada subsidy mendaki tu semua kan
mahal juga pastu kita singapore kita punya education kena tinggi baru kita punya job macam bagus bagus kau tengok ah nak jadi doctor education kena overseas university ke susah juga ah
kau kau masuk uni tak
aku punya course ni macam
kena masuk uni ah kalau tak aku takleh tak ada future untuk aku so university ah under medicine gitu tapi susah juga ah pasal very competitive punya situation so if I were to join a local university ah under medicine it will be so competitive with all the kids lor
aku punya impian actually nak jadi photographer ah tapi macam
impian photographer jer macam hobby gitu
so tak nak pursue sangat under photographer pasal freelancer kan so dia punya
hmm so just extra income kalau aku tak ada apa apa ah tapi sekarang aku ni belajar under medicine so
aku punya first and foremost punya important punya course nak masuk in uni will be under medicine ataupun
kau pula kau punya course apa ah
tak ah aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah
and then kalau nak try under pharmacy pula dorang punya
you all need macam diploma degree baru boleh dapat the experience
aku tengah cari kerja ah sekarang tapi pasal
times are tough ah so I know for government pun they macam
a bit tough to find job now even though macam
so a bit lah I don't think so I can tahan lor
eh berbual pasal COVID COVID ni semua kan eh aku dengar that time kau kena
satu kat malaysia
the one in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia tu a bit slow ah
um that's why ah if like you want to study overseas as a melayu I think kan australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where ah the place has accommodates to what you are lah like being a muslim so kalau kau nak tinggal kat korea kau kena tinggal kat itaewon situ ah ah cause I heard situ banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi contradict juga situ juga banyak tempat clubbing
so right semenjak kita kat rumah kan confirm kau tengok banyak Netflix kan confirm so macam cerita apa kau tengok kat Netflix
tak aku tengok movie eh
I a bit scaredy cat ah to watch that show but right talking about devil daughter teringat aku pula aku punya favourite show sekarang lucifer I don't know kalau kau tahu ah tapi banyak orang tengah bebual pasal cerita tu so basically dia macam ah detective punya show so they solve crimes and all that tu macam aku punya favourite genre ah ah so basically lucifer tu dia dia actually devil dia syaitan tapi tak ada orang terpikir that he's really the devil until like his face his devil face came out then like um then people started believing it ah cause they are like mere humans kan so dorang macam a bit scared of him but he's a really good detective also ah he work like hand in hand dengan the detective cop chloe it's a great show ah but it's super overrated now
no bukan part two it's like season five part one so the season five is split into two different um two different parts ah so got season five part one then got season five part two so the season five part one just recently came out then season five part two suppose to come out in like september so and so but then cause of COVID right they cannot like shoot the last few scenes last few episodes mah so in september then they resuming back lor cause the COVID
maybe can rent bike because I don't know if kat situ macam ada tempat rental bike kan macam east coast park kan ada tapi I dengar east coast park pun tutup pasal banyak orang ramai sangat orang kat situ
ah dia macam dia macam mana nak cakap ah dia macam mysterious kau tahu tak dia mysterious abeh macam kau ajak kan dia macam tak comfortable gitu dengan lelaki eh dengan perempuan so kat dalam school context okay ah but outside school context aku tak tahu ah tapi aku punya cikgu yang lagi satu kau tahu yang yang teacher tu aku nak jumpa tapi aku macam paiseh aku tak tahu nak ajak dia keluar ke tak
tu pun aku dah lama tak jumpa last aku jumpa pun february yang aku turun sekolah abeh then then hari tu aku nak wish happy teacher's day pun aku lupa
aku jumpa kau kat situ pe hari tu
aku tak ada sebab aku tengok jer aku tak ada sebab serious aku suka turun bawa pasal aku punya kan abeh aku sorang aku rasa abeh aku macam catch up ah dengan cikgu cikgu lain semua sekejap tapi other than that not much ah aku tak dapat aku ada number dorang ah tapi macam aku tak tahu kalau dorang save aku punya nombor ke tak ataupun dorang okay ke tak keluar dengan ex student tak tahu ah kau pernah nak ajak kau punya cikgu arts tak keluar
um a'ah lah dorang sekolah tapi lain lain tapi ada satu yang sama sama sekolah dengan aku um tapi dia different course ah dia masuk dulu baru dia year one sekarang aku kan year two sekarang so tu jer lah yang sama yang lain semua A-level ah
oh yang A-level punya dah quite some time ah dia tak ada dia tak ada banyak masa kan sekarang dengan A-level dia so nak jumpa dia pun susah kau pula
kau punya kawan yang best friend kau dulu kat tampines kan jauh kan
cause kan one of my friends yang A-level dia dia sekolah dekat jer ah not that far so macam to me also can also pick a place to find a day then like we just you know we just compromise a bit lor but cause we not that far right so not too bad ah cause our group of friends then got three of us so
I actually sometimes I want to see some teachers outside of school lah so like if I see them at least I can I got chance mah to say eh how you doing but because I never see them outside ah a bit sian lor then lor cannot catch up with them at all then macam susah ah gitu even during hari raya this year macam like nak gi ah apa rumah cikgu cikgu kan tak boleh pasal COVID kan so tu pun nak catch up pun susah abeh bila catch up pun macam kalau nak catch up kat luar sekolah tak tahu kalau dorang nak ke tak pasal kebanyakan cikgu kita kan lelaki
zoom raya ah it was like um I got two session ah one with my mum side one with my dad side morning we meet my mum side cause hor but our my mum side not a lot of people so it was easy to coordinate just call I three three like three families ah like mine included lor but then my dad side ah eight siblings eh difficult leh then they all very they cannot hear one another

yes ma'am then you know hari raya haji also this year at least got the the the curcuit breaker the the the I don't know ah what they call it ah the rule the ruling I think
not too bad ah can visit this year for hari raya haji like like five people per family eh five five visitors per household so you eh hari raya haji you got got visit your aunty your cousin I don't know
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
I cannot tahan ah I think ah I had to celebrate my birthday during circuit breaker like my birthday was right after the circuit breaker um announcement ah so a bit sad ah then like you know uh cannot have the big celebration like last time so I celebrate with my family lor but then I celebrate with my family also cannot do much cannot eat outside mah during that period of time so all order in lor then like a bit special kind of situation lah cause first time mah celebrate at home nobody else so okay ah not too bad hor how about you what is the most difficult part bila kau during circuit breaker
ah I drink bubble tea but like cause I a bit lactose intolerant so I can drink maybe like the small one if not like my stomach a bit upset so aku punya favourite bubble tea is called HEYTEA dia cuma ada kat orchard dengan jurong so tak banyak sangat ah aku quite picky on aku punya bubble tea KOI Gong Cha tu semua okay ah tapi aku lebih suka HEYTEA it's more settling to my stomach kirakan so if I buy bubble tea I will buy kat orchard ah kat situ kalau dekat dekat dengan rumah aku Gong Cha ah tapi tu bila kakak aku belanja tapi aku sekarang dah tak suka bubble tea kau pernah try mister coconut
yang colour pink yang mana satu
oh cause I go with my friend ah then my friend helped to pilih then you know she like a bit like a bubble tea expert ah she keep all the bubble tea chart all in singapore but then like um cause I wasn't that much of a bubble tea fan before so macam aku tak tahu apa aku nak beli abeh dia tolong aku dia tolong aku um pilihkan apa bubble tea like I think I tried the kalau aku tak salah aku tried the not the pink pearl ah I tried the tapioca pearl kot oh tak aku try yang black sesame pearl tu macam tak sedap sangat
aku rasa eh HEYTEA pun macam quite expensive aku rasa depending on apa kau beli ah aku selalu beli brown sugar so HEYTEA is about macam five eighty gitu then kalau kat CHICHA San Chen kau pernah try CHICHA San Chen tak
oh tu dia punya pearl very chewy very um sedap in my opinion tapi dia punya brown sugar nya tu macam macam macam susu ah basically dorang letak susu jer so but then I like their pearl ah not bad not bad sama dengan HEYTEA tapi kan paling mahal kan is uh not too sure eh hmm maybe
maybe maybe KOI aku dah lama tak tak try KOI
aku tak suka pearl dia ah to be honest like I tried the pearl ah it's a bit I mean I cannot I cannot expect lor cause their pearl is not the high end kind of pearl right so uh I just anyhow ah but like I buy also I a bit scared to try the pearl pearl or like the normal bubble tea lor I always try you know last time the one year of secondary school there like the bubble tea is the milo milo blended ah ice blended or something like that ah small like that lor
shiok bro shiok I tell you my favourite drink ah is horlick cause of that I I I cannot stop drinking horlicks ah I tell you is like wah out of the place eh my favourite drink now so like wah thinking about my school food ah oof now ah got halal mala also in one of the food court so not bad ah then their mala also not bad is just that the disappearing chicken the chicken keep every time we buy the big chicken ah suddenly come out ah after they make for us the chicken only left like three four pieces eh then we don't know where it go

wah but then the downside of it right I must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold leh like I swear I don't wear jacket right I I I confirm I want like shiver till damn bad I tell you but then after lunch ah somehow ah the aircon a bit leh sekali become hot but maybe because of window open ah then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
sometimes ya ah cause like we want the space to study right after school ah cause we need the school wi-fi then lor all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late ah then they play their game I don't know league of legend or mobile legend lor then they take up the space in um in the library eh then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already what they we cannot tell them uh excuse me we need the table mah so just have to tahan lor like wah leh then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor ah sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port no charging port then laptop die ah ah this kids ah
but I say ah she a bit lazy to go out cause got the safe entry thing then like nowadays also I got nothing to do mah so I sit at home with her then entertain her then now she at home she look at new recipe right then she make it all then all the makanan now right very different it's like post post post COVID like suddenly she add on I don't know what bunch of ingredient ah inside then all the masakan masakan lauk lauk yang dia buat kan semua macam different so macam dia ada add add extra ingredient kau tahu tak
lebih sedap ada ah tu memang ah tu standard tapi different tu different it's all macam ah how to say ah modified ah I guess
hmm oh I like soup ah so like my favourite will always be sup daging ataupun sup ayam but then sup ayam she tak buat sangat ah cause she say like a bit susah so tak tahu but ya
the thing is right she like she cook in the morning ah she cook in the morning I sleep you know then I wake up she finish cooking already even like sometimes she want to make the snacks ah I don't know if you got try before kuih keria wah that one I help her and stuff like pudding and stuff ingredient all I help her buy ah cause that's the least I can do mah then Sheng Siong also a bit a bit pity on her ah to go down buy stuff so I might as well just buy for her lor
dekat tu dekat ah jauh pun jauh cause I in the inside I the most inside the neighbourhood mah so to go out it's a bit troublesome also take like about fifteen minutes like that
walk ah don't want waste money don't want waste money buy ah apa sometimes take bus ah if I lazy want go home like that ah I take bus but other than that I walk ah walk faster
actually tak I go seorang
I got here like thirty minutes lah cause you know ah the train ah super late ah I really hate it you know the aunty mak cik all very irritating
tak lah kau gila punya jauh aku kalau boleh nak naik Grab but I didn't take Grab either no lah I very very everything I just take train or Grab but that time Grab is expensive ah so cannot lah okay I no more money already
eh you text me just now you say kau cakap kau ada mimpi eh
walao eh sakit sia
oh got saga just sambung ah walao eh then the then the second dream whose inside the dream
then the baby like what how she look like is she naughty dia baik ke dia macam
ya lor so macam like got the happy ending lah
ya but so many signs eh already like before sebelum ni pun macam like kau dah ada mimpi-mimpi right like all this type of dreams
so okay my intention is that ah aku nak cakap dengan engkau dulu the dream then after that both of us can like um
but like ten years ago how how umur kau berapa ten years ago
eighteen siapa kau dengan siapa ah masih dengan azee
so enam belas tahun kau tahu lah kan sec four eh ah sec four pun nak cakap apa sia dengan diri aku
dah happening ah actually dok aku sec four pasal aku dah jumpa julie semua apa
aku rasa macam aku wild cause uh I met him towards the end of my sixteen so means aku dah habis A-levels ah
so then ah hakim and I we started meeting and then he taught me how to longboard then we went to gigs but it's like going out with him is very decent like you know macam not say abang lah but he's
longboard I even worked with him at his Sakura part time until the following year uh seventeen years old I I masuk
uh and I hope that you're still friends with hakim which I still am alhamdulillah
our english always berterabur sis
tapi memang irritating ah kan
umur dia berapa macam oh
is she like really obvious that she didn't see you or dia just buat buat tak nampak
ah seh so no I'm like okay I like definitely if you ask me now I don't think there's anything that can make me dislike a person but if I try to backward backward like zaman I more impulsive and reckless
macam kita cakap macam condescending like like kita ni macam bodoh like that then ya lah then macam okay oh oh okay this one is the pettiest reason
because he tegur ah so it make me not like him so it's a petty reason lah
ya lah ya lah it's like okay but then again because the way they tegur ah it's like really kurang ajar also
but there is ways for you to like kejutkan orang you know this engineer ah will really scream at your face yell at your face one leh like like no cara tak ada cara aku aku macam nak sepak muka dia but then
masa kat kerja right tak boleh buat apa-apa so okay lah just terima seadanya jer lah
oh ya I think kau pernah bilang dengan aku ini
she's so weird because pasal kau dengan dia macam tak ada kena mengena gitu
like and then like my friend happens to be that conversation so she she told me then di belakang aku padahalnya macam
she's like kau tahu yang ni tak suka kau then aku macam apasal
she then like I was really shocked lah cause aku really like pandang dia macam sister ah but then like
and then I'm like when I heard that I was like kesian or what like you think your tits are the selling point ah bro
ya and it's like very macam
rabak ah like eh aku oval tak tahu merah ke tak sial bising sial aku oval ha walao eh
then I ask lah who is this girl then he told me then I know that girl what she's my ex-classmate then I then I then aku naive ah habis aku cakap dengan dia ah like
like you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate dia dulu like always
stupid sia you just so stupid like you're so stupid like perangai jantan kebrek punya macam like oh you are les let me turn you straight like you don't try to be some hero and in fact she's the one who manipulated you
so ya lah but I never confronted after her her after that but if I everytime I saw her at school I will just like jeling her so hard and like actually uh like I'm not the type to
hate on girls or are like macam be enemies with them but wow what she did was something so nasty and like even if she never did it to me right let's say she did the whole thing to another person I would still feel so turned off
I know lah like okay your self esteem probably like jatuh because you know all the guys like went to me like I don't blame you for that but for you to take vengeance that way is so dirty and nasty sia
ya babe kau tak payah cakap babe ex aku dia nombor satu babe dia kalau buat benda dia fikir pakai konek jer dulu sebelum apa-apa babe
bodoh sia
I think it's just more to me it comes off to me like wah aku tak tahu ada manusia macam gini macam that can do that to someone else not that I was so hurt by it but I'm just like so
apa babe
ya that's so awesome nanti kalau kau pergi travel settle sia
oh ya and like baca quran and also kau faham
I'm not surprised that you want that because aku macam pernah nampak kau like one like being handy like remember that that that thing jatuh kat toilet
like ah but it's not because I will learn cooking eventually but it will be like beginner level so if I could take one skill that's immediate like chef level mak aku punya level I will take cooking
aku tahu berenang ah but I pun tak pernah masuk dalam ah berenang aku tahu pasal kat secondary school kita belajar
eh float dah okay sia some people don't even know how to float which I teach them also ah sometimes
but ya I would learn how to sea dive actually it's a very ah actually cooking and sea diving I feel is very doable lah can so ya but if I could choose it right now aku terus tahu it's sea diving ah
kau bayar setakat berapa hundred dollars then kau dapat can do sea diving cuma kat singapore nothing to sea dive ah so you have to overseas ah
so third skill if I could pick up okay ah kalau nak cakap nyanyi nyanyi is more of like a natural born lah so tak boleh ah kan
can ke oh kena vocal coaching
ya ah like okay some people macam like born with it like dah bagus but ya there's many cases dia orang macam vocal coaching right
right is the vocal coach yang kau tengok kat YouTube tristan is it
ah I always watch tristan correct and then his recent videos james charles nyanyi dia sedap sia ya it's nice
rabak sial babe
suddenly aku suddenly aku punya spike up banyak apasal
kau can think out of the box kau boleh ambil orang err orang korea orang jepun orang malaysia orang indonesia it's up to kau lor
so you wake up you look at the cermin and then you'll be like oh be that man be like ya sia then eyebrows I've dark eyebrows
but you know kau tahu ah dia kena bahan rabak kan kau tak tahu eh rabak
dia actually from season tak dia tak kena bahang umbrella academy umbrella academy does a great job ya kat luar because
kau faham tak he's young like no lah macam like booboos like err macam on Instagram live macam macam macam acting weird acting macam socially awkward
but I guess the ones who's making fun of him are also about that age ah macam thirteen sia so ya but then it's a lot of them so they really bahang kan him lah ya
but you know goodness kau tu belum lagi nampak
ada satu video dia nyanyi kat Instagram live memang kelakar ah dia macam nyanyi yang yang love yang love love tu but that is not so rabak also
correct cause we're like dude oh wait kita lagi rabak daripada dia kan okay we couldn't even act back then
rabak ah uh correct but then I think after season two ah umbrella academy kan
macam this season dia orang lagi banyak scenes kan and like boleh cakap he bawa the whole show on his back
so it's like even though like the bahang still exist but uh I think a lot of people are giving him acknowledgement and credit that he deserve ah for season two
padahal dia orang tunjuk pun macam the videos of him being socially awkward with his fans online pun macam pada aku like normal seh like it's just like macam
dia macam okay he has a sort of personality lah which is a bit quirky but if we see it as quirky then you will understand why his awkward not as
it can be anything from audio err to like macam you doing cartoon and then he will showcase it and bring it forward to the world you know
like ya that's why uh recently if you saw dia macam post something like hey someone in malaysia can you guys um
err say a a poem a puisi in malay err so that aku like so that dia boleh
wife dia is a like a like a brilliant also like she's some ah president for like an kind of company so
personal life cause I was a fan I was a very huge fan of johnny depp when I was in my teenage years all so aku
okay dia tak resist to adopt like so many kids from different parts of the world
and it takes two hands to clap also and also like I think the relationship between brad pitt and angelina tu pun macam dysfunctioning at that point of time like because brad pitt did come up of thing to be saying that
jennifer still wanted to have fun macam you know they were they were high they were taking weed
and then like when I see her older videos when she was younger right when she was like gila gila
macam you go out you go out of the house and then like so many girls
you can speak korean because that's the body's ability but then nanti ada orang melayu macam ah
aku faham sia dia cakap habis apa macam tapi how you learn that sia
ah ya ya tak payah pergi kerja so there's no nothing like you there's no transaction to get something or whatever so basically right maybe you can imagine the world in a in a more messed up way
like macam dah macam end of times ah tak ada kerja langsung ah macam so macam purge ke apa macam
it could be looked both ways it could be either super peaceful or either rabak it depends on the community I think
huh macam mana kau nak beli benda ya correct
jangan kau messed up dangut sudah sia you need this you
I feel like ya I feel like ya I feel like Netflix should do like a seh can just do a whole show based on this question alone like macam imagine kan
tak pernah ah singapore in general babe
dah banyak benda kita tak dia orang tak buat major it's so boring sia
but ya like the macam
imagine if they did something more non realistic like not family drama and like macam just you know
ah like that's why Netflix shows always make it what right because the umbrella academy is not going to happen in real life like ya apocalypse ini semua
okay definitely cannot be macam a one time hit thing pasal singapore satu
satu island dah jatuh babe ya dia kena macam sikit sikit sikit lah
but I think kalau macam there was like maybe a five episode show ah apocalypse in singapore kan
comedic like from there you know indian to the chinese to the malay then campur them together eh ya sia bro rabak already sia bro
same government and then like suddenly like everybody aunty uncle mak cik all united
oh he want to it could be anything lah ya like you said because global warming ah then you know factory they campak here campak there barang so like
so like using bandages lah obviously if you want to talk the islamic context we already know so we take that away this one is imagination is um ya I will just imagine that one person kena sakit
sakit then lepas tu um
ah dia sakit biasa habis dia dah mati tu kan doctor tu macam nak tengah nak tutup dia habis tu doctor tu sakit but from just sending tahu
then the doctor cough at the wife when he come back home then the wife sakit then the sakit she becomes the first zombie
then maybe we can place this selalu always the lah dapat all this kind of thing korea also already let's put this at malaysia very close home
so ya lah so then it starts from there then then you know malaysia people quite degil right they still want to surau they still want to solat at the masjid so they go and then orang masjid pula kena
gigit zombie and then very close to oh but then singapore is kiasu huh so from the first time we hear the one
person already kena then we already cut the borders so it's quite safe ya we already like
dian kuai dian</mandarin one like very cut that bridge ataupun ya correct
because tak boleh already sia kau tahu kalau macam zombie yang macam macam itu besar boleh lari punya habis sial dia lari sudah sampai dah so we have to like they have to
ya okay if they could if they could swim ah you know how singapura last time the history how we put the
you know the tajam-tajam that we couldn't let the sea the the ikan yang macam panjang ah correct
so we will go back to history and we'll do that so the cannot wah then like ya orang singapore will like train each other like macam
and we're like somehow tercampak from everyone else besides like err indonesia so ya but then this will
so bird flu semua we used to have bird flu lah swine flu lah banyak lah seh mad cow disease
ya macam case macam chronic gila macam kau once flu okay this person is going to die in two days
actually a lot of things sia anything if you do it repetitive for eight hours macam boleh merana sia
so imagine kalau kau brush your teeth it's a normal act tapi imagine you have to do it eight hours
gum kau dah dah dah dah dah sah dah sah dah kau dah over
ya so actually anything could be err ni kalau tapi exercise
cuma only maybe tengok ah it won't be a torture
pasal kau boleh tukar banyak channel kan kesian ah aku kat rumah
ya tak lah pasal kalau kau tengok different different cerita lain ah okay ah kalau kalau kau tengok the same show for eight hour then ya maybe ah
but then if like because kalau tengok ah cerita like err in general for eight hours it's not even like torture it's like it's what we do on like rest days like
ya unless your eating is like macam you can choose what you want to eat so maybe like eat sikit-sikit but
the real torture is like the person gave you nasi ayam okay you need to eat this nasi ayam for the next eight hours repetitively
orang boleh mati sia from exhaustion exhaustion exhaustion what other everyday activity that you wouldn't think is a torture but it's a torture if you do it for eight hours
I think washing your face like washing your face with a facial scrub lapan jam straight
kau punya kulit boleh dry sia
oh my god rabak gila actually anything that you do to do your body for eight hours ah
sometimes he dust it at eight hours so he thinks eight hours always like that now penat aku like clean the like you know he do the whole thing
I think ah ya I don't know why I thought of brushing teeth straightaway that's like ugh eight hours sakit sia gigi aku
teruk sia
aku macam ada high pitch moment uh bila excited macam ni so ya
apa sia
if it's for yourself macam
ya macam I
ya kau pernah other vulnerable component like you just you know I want to go on current god do you like the how is it whatever the I I also have
oh ya kau pernah like dengar kawan kawan kau ada third eye how is it for them like I I also have
ah of course wei menyusahkan sia
correct I but I don't know whether they can choose that option to tutup that batin I think
I think they maybe can but cannot go to bomoh lah go to an ustaz or something lah a skilled ustaz
I also have like my friend's friend ah dia pun boleh nampak benda so macam
it's not everytime akan ada benda but macam sometimes ah so macam tengah lepak ataupun
lepak kat luar pun nanti dia cakap eh ada benda ah kat situ ah atau dalam bilik macam alamak ada benda kat sini ah
are they constant tu or are they consistent
oh they want to scare you sia basically dah tak sui ah sis
oh I know him sia nak saja takutkan ni
ya ya boyfriend mana ni
oh I hate that everytime I ask about that ex you tak even refer nama dia kau just panggil dia misai
and I hate also that aku boleh macam oh ya as
though you only have one ex with one misai but
because his misai was the most evident ya
kau follow dia dekat social media ke tak
okay ada low key ah alright
okay so for me my unusual super power apa sia
I think ah the super power that siapa that
for like betul-betul like for bad people then like macam let's say this bad person was going to kill someone then
she can whisper them like macam you are not going to this you are going to try and believe in yourself you know
use it for really so the person that has that power has such as strong responsibility not to misuse it tau not for herself
like but we cannot macam do it for them as in for example a guy who is immature right we cannot be like
macam cheat code ah macam they don't go through the process so it's more like you are going to start going therapy
but then macam
and also macam I I get it like I also wouldn't want my partner to be misusing it on my child but
so ya but I mean it is messed up but messed up to a point that nak sampai divorce semua macam
chill lah like sort of like she rumour you tak berapa baik lah
kau ingat yang the part where ellen page pergi slice the car
ya ya ya but it's so kesian in the season two end up she never use but her husband irritating
kau just enjoy dia punya power habis kau nak use it the definition of toxic men sia babe aku throughout the movie aku just like
like get go I was trying to obviously give him the benefit of the doubt lah kan pasal dia macam
this like heroic black man but then as we go go through macam and he's not
luther sia aku prefer bluther with allison even though in the first season I was like meh but
dia tu baru cakap kau sayang citizen kau
yes one room flat but then nak kena ada conditions to pass lah so you must like graduate ini semua okay so if you haven't met that those conditions you still live with your parents
but then if you still haven't met that conditions then it's either kau can get the twenty one year old house ataupun stay with your parents
and then the last will be thirty years old which is like a five room flat because nanti kan semua dah ada anak semua apa
so it's all government dah macam plan untuk kau orang
and it's not like semua dapat what it's like there's conditions what so it's also it makes sense what right
ya that's why ya the ration is over there because the thing is with food is free obviously orang yang tak tamak okay lah kan
tapi kau imagine lah orang yang kau tahu kau tahu yang macam dah suka belum apa-apa dah pergi hog semua exactly kau imagine
ya takkan dia sapu
ya no food I think food can't be free I think if I really want one food that is free ah one thing that is free is ah ni sanitary pad
but condoms mana satu pun orang kasi free free per
so anyway uh babe uh kau wish aku lah ah untuk interview aku
eh babe thanks ah pasal kau macam berbual dengan aku semua so aku dah have a gauge
because  macam takde kawan gitu then  takde orang cam ajak but also  macam I want to like stay at home honestly cause like I really tired from like all the school work  berlambak kat like when you were studying
yay finally do you think  kita like  akan ada graduation ceremony
yeah  aku nak ambil gambar semua with like all my friends it will be memorable and
maybe but not so much lah because like I'm so tired of studying and the workload  banyak gila nak kena buat and  dengan  jugak
honestly I just finished my very last assignment then ya I didn't sleep that much honestly so I'm like taking a break  sekarang yeah
it was on my module quality management be ah  soalan dia anything to do with quality lah basically  macam there's something called balance scorecard that kind of thing you got learnt before ah it just  macam companies  guna like for
its quite a fun module ah do you got any module  yang kau enjoy
 tapi kau dulu pon kau cakap nak jadi pilot kan like or is that like not really
err I feel like err singapore airlines  rugi seh  kalau tak ambik kau cause like I feel like you very like you are capable ah of working there yeah I can I can foresee that you will do good in your job
tomorrow is tuesday right um honestly just stay at home like I want to  tengok my Netflix shows yeah
is there any Netflix show  yang kau tengah tengok sekarang like what what what is something that you are recommend me because like I don't know what to watch also actually

the module I mean the intern manager like yeah and the company's like it just saying that oh near this  ada students that will be working under you like that its just like it just a list lah that show that show who will be interning with me basically yeah
no no no but the thing is we are all separated into different different location so I'm gonna be alone ah which is  sedih yeah
 kau dah  carik err part time  punya kerja
no actually  aku enjoy seh
because like err  kau tau aku lah  aku memang suka duduk rumah aku memang pemalas nak keluar yeah and I feel like I can really rest cause you know sometimes when you go out you can be tiring like yeah like everyday we have to school right like even though its quite near but just lazy and but then one thing I don't like is the we have to study at home lah because its very hard to focus like I'm not gonna lie I slept during lessons before yeah
like thirty minutes like that yeah but its still manage to catch up on the lessons though lah I can still understand so okay lah but its very hard to focus then very hard to understand also at the same time then like  aku kan  pemalu kan so dah lah  nak kena press the recording then like its very hard because you don't want to interfere like when the teachers talking and all right yeah its a bit hard ah through teams all
 itu ah
quite manageable  tapi macam one or two modules  susah sebab ada maths yeah  susah sikit lah hmm
but alhamdulillah ada my friend is smart so she can help me
then  kadang kadang macam
 macam err  kau tak nak macam tanya soalan bodoh gitu so like
hmm honestly I want to  kerja tapi err my parents  nak me to go to uni first
which I mean I I don't mind  tapi nak kena tengok result  dulu lah cause you know uni kan  susah sikit kan like you have to be at least three point five and  walaupon macam three point five  pon
you might not get in also because the competition is too thight you know you have to compete with faci people and all so  macam aku pon takut lah but at the same time also  aku tak tahu nak buat course  apa yeah I I have to do a lot of research on my own lah but yeah everything now is like I'm unsure I just
 pandai pandai that's a smart idea yeah
oh yes like you know like I I was thinking about it I feel like I don't want to  kerja kat office I think that is so  macam stressfull because you have to deal with  orang lain some  orang tak kan  macam suka kau you know and then you have to deal with the boss I mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah I mean like the working hours
I mean like it's it's tiring lah from what I see like I ask my sister right like how she work like she also have her own office drama  padahal dia tak buat apa apa macam ada orang macam just don't like her lah like especially since she got award she got an award right for being the best a good worker like this ah the person was like jealous of her and all so its like so annoying I don't know I think I want  aku nak jadi boss
I think that will be nice but business  tak tau ah  nak buka business  apa eh
oh yeah  aku nak jual apa seh
 tapi like what kind of cafe you know this kind of you want like like like some cafe they sell like lunch kind or lunch dinner ah like rice everything right but there is also the bakery kan of cafe with the coffee cake which one you want
yeah you know  macam orang dulu dulu cakap start jer  kecik apa  sikit sikit nanti err
at the west because all the cafes right now is is at the  dekat bugis  semua jauh kita kan  tinggal kat west kan  habis cam cafe  dekat sini is so limited so we should open one at our area yeah
 sekarang err  makanan apa ah  yang viral  sekarang
what is the trending food right now  apa apa lah  apa apa
oh yeah dekat Liho pon ada
 kau ada kau ada
kau ada instant coffee
ha okay then  kita boleh buat ah  nanti
err I think brown sugar right like everything also have brown sugar then I see  macam orang put the pearl  dekat pancake or something  macam semua benda nak kena ada pearl  macam a bit  merepek lah
yeah I mean  aku suka bubble tea but as just a drink is okay lah but once its like in completing in food I think it's weird but I don't know I've never tried but just the idea of it  macam merepek ah yeah
ha  aku sekarang tengah pokai  ni so  tunggu aku kerja dulu my intern  baru kita pergi you know have fun yes

kan  aku pun macam benda dia orang macam baju just one T shirt  pun boleh jadi err  macam sixty like
and the food there is  sedap you should try
I eat  nasi lemak
it's gonna be a struggle for me but I do like  macam tempura you know  dengan nasi nasi those breaded kind of food is nice duh like I would defenitely want to try it like that because  macam authentic kan  macam sedap ah  dengan dia punya japanese curry I've never try it
is like I think sweet and uh  sedap ah  macam looks nice yeah
but we never like eat any street food you know we eat like like proper restaurants but yet we still  macam diarrhoea  muntah muntah semua macam it's quite rabak seh
everything is nice actually is like singapore ah but you know their food  macam it's feels more homie feels more authentic like their  nasi goreng can imagine lah  macam very nice  dengan dia punya sambal dengan dia punya keropok is yeah you should try go there one day
yeah actually maybe because of the place that we go to lah but we did  macam go to like their old old houses like I don't know how to say

K K K admittedly macam macam budak-budak ah macam main dengan boy look look at look at wilfried freaking zaha what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
geram seh then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about gareth bale and sergio aguero and and thiago
but oh look dia pun sign the only work
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database pakai football manager semak
david moyes kat mana dia baru lawan arteta last week
eh but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna angkat again ah the korang punya the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular thiago
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the barcelona against inter milan punya game ah barcelona ah eh sorry um
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't van gaal doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone yang terus shoot the ball tau
ah basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to kelam kabut he lose the ball there
ya but klopp he he demands the intensity and that kelam kabut
oh sun sun sun sun sun sun sun ah whatever lah melayu swan melayu
bro I have not been playing in that long for a long time aku main best twenty one ah sekarang eh best twenty twenty

robert pattison I cannot bayang that man after that glittery shit show on
so you are talking about macam child molesting kind of

cause they're controversy people are boycotting cuties and apa okay ah to
quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing ah and kau kau tahu the controversy behind it
this de-sexualisation of minors kan selalunya I would say kan syaiton slowly syaiton is slowly inserting his influence on these things ah
but err you know I I didn't even look trailer I just look at the freaking post and yell what the heck you don't even they are twins budak-budak ni they are just
it's my niece ah ones from that age right now so I feel it's freaking sick and you you it's creepy when you detach yourself from that film but into the real world tau kau imagine eh the fact that

ah ya lah ya lah one of the subject people from france punya territories ah
but ya from breaking free from the traditions of senegal ini kan but that's that's the thing she she's justifying it by saying like oh it's a coming of
aku nak tahu ni who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through budak-budak sebelas tahun macam
he's he plays like nerdy character macam he himself looks like
a'ah sia eh makin is it okay when back in korang ada dengar rumours
one of my junior in and err budak he err lieutenant in the army when I when I came in through when I was in he was already a lieutenant
he went after then ah and he okay dia dia
dia macam apa tau he's the eager to please ah
I can imagine him kalau dalam eh if you take a platoon in their time
he's one of those who first to volunteer first to it very on the ball nak good kid
very quiet ah dengar cakap
always does his best and high flyer in terms of academics and not a bit so dia physically small but willing to push himself
when I was a recruit in the army kat canteen and and dekat cookhouse and he's a lieutenant there he saw me then he
pause for moment and he's dia gagap tau dia macam err err where he almost called me sir
setahun jer ah ah but you know I retain one year that kind of thing so
his face came out in the news lah surat khabar aku baca straits times I not sure whether he did it or not lah I mean if he go by islamic standards I have to verify
did dia nya he put in the dark net or something
orang kita ah
ah favour ah kau forward pada aku kat WhatsApp
and the thing is what I find important is the prinsip behind the marriage tau pasal back in our ancestors punya time dorang
it's not just a matter of it's a matter of prinsip and honour as well tau macam you don't marry for love you marry first and you make the relationship work the love will come later
they he determines the man is suitable then meminang
perlu ah
no I think the prinsip of have a say ni I think dorang ada cuma the tendency at that in point was ah our parents know best ah so if they think is the man is right enough for us then shouldn't refuse ah
ya I will let let benda ni semua kalau aku dapat menantu macam dia kau nak carikan aku carikan aku macam dia
scary eh aku macam
aku okay I I had a talk with one of my closest cousins ah this guy four years older than me

dia kata we we're not fulfilling anybody's expectations only ours bro eh lady you you're at you're fulfilling expectations of big makeup pharmaceutical company is really you they are the ones
you not conforming to expectations relax sua minah confirm kau you can live within your own bubble without looking at the bigger picture and as long as what makes you happy ah

you will draw the line at games right it's talking about Netflix aje ah I I've been
aku have been caught in watching
so ah kita have been watching this first show which actually was an old show ah it's called breaking bad
eh but better call saul to me is better correct better dia punya jalan cerita lama asal
tak cause you have not
correct ah but but better call saul is ongoing dia belum habis
ah I think season one season two you still ah dekat ah jimmy jimmy ya but kau belum nampak dia punya character development whereby he has his moral dilemmas
he's not wrong per se which is not legally wrong tapi is
aku rasa three ah three three to four ah then um
then you see how brothers three each other and everything ah so kau dah tengok dia punya abang treat dia macam mana
okay okay so you kau dah tengok part yang dia bastard adik dia ah
he basically tore his brother down to shreds and his brother will macam lookout to him as this ideal brother figure in his illusion
the brother mati ke belum
okay better call saul dah sampai season six eh
but then now not not okay now while while I'm waiting for better call saul to restart aku tengok aku follow up with apa tau with ah

oh ya ya ya right right now starting starting ah aku memang suka baca ah but starting last week
baik sia it's a british show it's it's a good change from the american latino gangster thing ah
okay pasal aku aku
no no no how I do my safe entry basically kalau let's say somewhere which I go often eh tampines mall
I don't close I don't ever close that browser so the next time I come ah use that same old from maybe last week or something aku malas sia nak scan scan balik ya ya I breaking protocols here but ya that's how I do it
A level O level semua keluar a'ah okay
okay ah so boleh ah
but apa double tap terus masuk camera mode apa
code keluar the camera app ah
aku press camera app I point it at the code
a'ah so why double tap can just masuk the app then
tu ah I was thinking apa macam sial ah aku tengok is that a code jadi code to your address or
so what's the ayat
so the start of the ayat start at the bottom
I I see what you did that you got ayatul kursi on
give me a good few suggestions eh ah my dad told me there's this good place dekat somewhere near the mushroom park opposite mushroom park
ah it's not at mushroom park tau mushroom park is old chang kee punya run is it's a cafe run by old chang kee but it's apparently across err
I know it's across mushroom park atau across the stadium
anchorvale nya
a'ah it's cheap but you can't get anymore melayu then that ah eh
wait so it it's not a good name cause there's no place to lepak or it's not a good name cause there's no corner for you to lepak
it's like the conundrum you how do you confused a mat you ask him you know put in a round room and ask me to lepak one corner
oh the cross across the simpang ini kan ya correct correct correct
semuanya okay
oh aku baru balik dari batam meet my family during this COVID lah
some place most of the places is quiet lah some of them err ada yang dah tutup tak ada apa tu business kan some of them close
ah like massage parlours all dah tutup
a lot yang know like people with families lah with families I think affected them a lot orang some of them macam duduk kat kedai kopi hari-hari you know cannot do anything have to wait for this thing to be over kesian
so he dia dah tak dah takde kerja so he buat tu lah parking lah do the parking
tanam sayur kat kat kat apa dekat tu ah dekat tu kat barelang
tanam sayur dapat gaji lah sikit-sikit
ya yang macam kan normally kan over there when you park your car before you move kan ada orang datang they they call it orang tukang parking lah so they jaga to park jaga that parking area parking shift so one day I think the pay is about hundred thousand which is about singapore ten dollars
harvest already then after that jual ah kat pasar okay okay okay then other than that how's how's the the the the mall there the tourists there and the
what do you call it the massage spa abeh shopping centre
huh that means from singapore you have to fly to jakarta first then from jakarta quarantine for one night lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang then pergi batam why never go batam directly from singapore take ferry
okay okay tanah merah because you know just recently I heard I read this news you know this singaporean that have not return back from singapore for seventeen years ah dia cakap macam macam nazi lah macam world war two lah kena halau sana halau sini I not sure whether it's true or not lah but
ah so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like macam nazi lah but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason ah
ah okay lah because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have sentosa hotel I don't know lah these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning ah betul tak then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
okay lah alhamdulillah lah at least okay apa at least something kan daripada takde apa-apa then kalau kata orang tu kalau tak nak tak nak tak nak bayar then jangan lah keluar duduk kat singapore jer betul tak
oh abeh sekarang tengah buat apa lepak ah sekarang tak buat apa-apa ah
makan tidur makan tidur terus menjadi tau badan cannot no badan semua menjadi nanti have to go for exercise already have to keep fit already if not ah mati ah then what what what what what you doing later after this
okay lah you are become your own boss what now is your own boss ah err own own job own own money everything your own don't don't need to report to anybody what just report to the money the longer you work you get more money err but kerja kerja kerja sikit dapat sikit kerja banyak dapat banyak okay lah alhamdulillah lah kata orang kan
okay lah you control your own finances lah in a way that you can control your time then kalau ada apa-apa boleh habis siang kalau takde apa-apa boleh kerja lambat sikit so at least in a way
new year tahun ini jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak
betul betul betul I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd lah so
apa-apa yang countdown semua dekat neighbourhood estate jer lah
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning lah macam north east south west ke apa so kat mana-mana yang okay kau tinggal north ada bunga api tinggal south ada bunga api west ada bunga api so instead of going to the central punya bunga api so everybody goes your own division their own area their own kampung to enjoy lah but anyway I mean
singapore bila
sixteen march ke
sixteen march dia orang tutup sixteen march sekali kira march april may june july august september november a'ah betul lah dah sembilan bulan ah
pejam celik pejam celik dah nine months dah nak masuk satu tahun
you no need to take sikit-sikit what what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
you have to book through these five different platform okay err yang satu changi and then err I think trip err there's another three more lah aku tak ingat mana satu err then
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself ah you can use that or you can use partly the only thing yang you cannot do yang kau tak boleh buat is kau buat stack up maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus then kita combine dua ratus kita stay in hotel for free ah itu tak boleh tapi
kalau let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can uh offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up ah that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it lah so in the domination of ten meaning let say kalau kau example kalau kau pergi zoo ke apa kan maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars lah or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that ah tapi tak boleh combine lah that's how it goes but
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to kelam-kabut kata orang kan ah pelan-pelan ah next year pun boleh january pun boleh february pun boleh as long as pakai sebelum july lah so ya
kau belum pernah pergi sea aquarium ah eh talking about sea aquarium aku pun pernah pergi ah adventure cove
ah mampus
macam mana boleh tak orginal ada potong potong ke mampus kat mana ni kat batam ni indonesia lah
dia ambil they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus jer ah kurang ah wah ini macam pun boleh eh mati
mampus take advantage of the whole situation lah to get something ah
takut daripada negative jadi positive
macam-macam ah eh sekarang ni
oh ya ya saiful one so touching ah I didn't know that he will do that video was like I was like what he really record down the video he say he miss his wife who is in then after that what he did he he go and purchase the binoculars two binoculars one for him one for his wife he send to his wife then after that pergi kat semberang tambak johor and and one of them dekat woodland one of them dekat johor dekat apa tu tempat tu eh eh

err saiful wedding then along the way I think because of this COVID semua tarik-tarik then in the end decided not to go when the announcement came that those who goes to singapore ah those from singaporean goes to overseas come back have to do quarantine have to do swab everything then become viral so in the end tak jadi pergi but alhamdulillah they get married in singapore first before the main one at malaysia what so kat malaysia semua cancel kan everything cancel because of this COVID ya ya ya true true true this year ya I think ya ya after that ah I think during that period still
people are still was-was fifty fifty whether to go or not to go to go or not to go then after that
and then the wife is there but lucky he get married in singapore then after that go sanding dekat johor kan ya ya ya true true true true
no but singapore pun ada
singapore boleh
ya but the nikah dekat singapore kan johor okay
tak tahu because if not have to pay still have to pay what that means he if he bring his wife
empat ribu enam ratus ringgit ringgit dah macam divide by three one thousand plus lah so he has to stay two weeks first in the hotel for stay home I mean err lah consider
stay for two weeks instead of seven days kelakar betul lah malaysia ini
asal dua minggu tak tujuh hari johor pun kelakar juga
malaysia ni
aku pun tak faham ah
rezeki mana-mana boleh ada lah inshaallah lah rezeki mana-mana ada yang important your happiness is the one that you need to find lah if can find if you can find happiness rezeki mesti ikut punya ah okay lah

next year aku dah ada few jemputan
iffah my saudara
then my kawan kerja lama
what why does it have to be my birthday weekend actually yang the cousin yang got married also he planned eleven july then aku macam oh my god why is it has to be eleven july then they
perempuan ada amalina perempuan
eh ada amalina lelaki
oh no no no because that time like ah the minggu sebelum dorang apa ni kahwin I I just went to their new house ah
ya dia jemput then just duduk berbual-bual then he was saying about err I think we're just asking like the school lah ya then I said oh I'm from zhong zheng then say oh zhong zheng I I wanted I wanted that actually she said ah ya but uh akak apa err macam pergi sana tapi tengok macam dah ramai orang then mak dia cakap takpe takpe apply different school so she said she applied for griffiths ya then ya I don't know suddenly it dawned on me just now like eh macam that I know if I'm not wrong kau pula as in kau apa your primary school was in griffiths so ya
eh is it still existent dah tak right
no cause last time kan I mean I handled K two right and then like I I see like parents some like really macam kanchiong macam want to push the children
oh no tak
asal dia masuk angsana pula eh
what is the tempat baru
orh eh mm green ridges tampines green banyak ah tampines green banyak sangat
as in dekat blok kau ah dulu
no like takut apa
termati ke apa dia macam wasted all the recording
um ya my budak nakal dia withdraw
ya but the reason was like they say it's not because of the school or anything lah is because like the grandpa macam is sick or something like oh having surgery and then um it's difficult for them to travel back and forth
so the kid I mean ah over for macam child care centre punya um like have to serve two months' notice so they still have to come to school for two months ah and they still have to pay the school fees for two months ya then they can
like if once like january like the new school year start maybe he will not want he will not really come to school because it's a bit weird to like start macam you know february
ya he's going to another school he dia kan very smart kan so dia berbual-bual lah tadi jer uh apa sebelum my shi</mandarin come for work dia dah bilang ni dah oh ah you're going to a new school um ya it's called little school house uh it's at tampines tampines station and like okay ya imagine three years old ya he's like crazy smart berbual jer like nonstop
ya but whatever it is ya I'm hoping maybe uh macam dah tengok macam gini kan maybe I could just stay for like
I told you right my my colleague apa mengandung I think dah tujuh bulan eh nampak perut besar gila then kena handle budak kecil tau
then dia cakap oh penat ah penat ah dia cakap kalau boleh dia cakap kalau apa dah apa ni pregnant macam ni jangan jangan jangan kerja ni ah dia cakap kan of course
I mean if you handle older kids okay ah but if you handle younger kids susah seh
kalau younger kids yes definitely pasal aku cakap kan macam bend asyik bongkok naik bongkok naik ya it's very sakit ah belakang
tak kalau macam um budak kecil like play group like kau kena cebokkan nak tukar diaper semua ya you're constantly using your back leh ah
ya kita orang macam gini okay lah habis kalau kau pregnant macam mana seh
actually what do head of departments do last like last time I was in primary school I always wondering apa punya orang buat seh like they like always always in the office like you see
consider own free time lepak minum teh minum teh kat lah canteen
orh eh then usually consider gaji besar eh besar gila kan
oh banyak five K
tanah besar kan is it
ah tak potong
a'ah sia dorang gaji tak potong
apa gaji tak potong wah shiok seh bawa balik
I I mean I'm not surprised that like ya earn five K because macam childcare punya principal also they earn like they can earn up to four K you know
climb cuma cuma aku jer yang tak nak panjat
nak stay jer
no because if I were to become principal I wouldn't have a life man ya serious I've never seen a principal who like can leave work on time if that principal can leave work on time it's considered cincai punya ya macam kesah tak kesah jer
but by right macam ya seriously like
ya I mean I mean kita orang dah belajar kan macam macam tak perlu I I mean that's the thing I know they say like it's not good to have this concept macam how to say ah
it's not like um the malas concept or something but it's just the
I mean every career pun mesti ada macam dia punya progression ah ya but
daripada travel pergi ke sini
check time dulu check time
apa ten days seven night
sama ah
dah menguap eh aku sorry
aku nak pergi umrah lah inshallah probably and then uh scotland is one of them and then also
I don't know why there was this one time macam aku suddenly teringat tau macam orang-orang kat kashmir macam macam macam and then that feeling of kesian macam ya
maybe another five after kashmir eh really like we all pergi sana oh my goodness
semua badan naik seh
briyani dia lah imagine you
sarapan briyani makan tengah hari briyani
apa makan malam pun briyani
err muak juga ah
lauk macam butter chicken oh ya and then over there is famous for the butter chicken so it's always butter chicken butter chicken butter ya I can imagine but the thing is so nice it's so good like ugh you just eat
aku kat sana terkentut-kentut sia the last time I pergi dengan my cousins kan so macam stay sama bilik eh sorry eh sorry then dorang ketawa-ketawa boleh boleh boleh inshallah boleh ya
uh tempat sembahyang there's there's mosques around you can go
tapi solat tak ada masalah cause when we planned our itinerary
lepas tu boleh jamak apa ya

bagi aku sometimes your guest is the most important key juga like people want to hear our podcast because of our guests
pasal to tell you the truth right aku macam aku have always been thinking like
senang untuk kita start the topic senang untuk kita follow with each other
maybe because of the connection ah mystery and connection pada kecil kita orang dah have been together this semua berbual
so kita nak click senang so for dia tak kan ada dead space oh
in your recording bagi aku that's very important kalau kau ada dead space jer mati jer
ya juga
then aku rasakan kalau kita nak buat podcast eh
one of kita punya daily topics kita nak kena ada apa ni
minute of silence ke kan untuk kita baca obituary
senang buat profit kita kelakar tak ada benda nak berbual kan

might be apa ni City Gas dia orang tak alamak
aku tak boleh call kejap ah aku nak kena message ah
aku nak ada message jer cuba aku message bro
kau tanya who is this City Gas is it
kalau orang City Gas lepas ini kita terus rush sana ah settle sana so kita pergi boon keng ambil kau punya

ah kau maintain lagi lima belas minit kau dapat power nap
tapi aku tegak tengok macam mana pasal tadi one of the criteria aku baca kau tak boleh be doing activity juga kan or is it noisy activity well I'm know
kau tengah buat ni ya kau tengah buat yoga
ke kuat ohm
tak boleh aku akan hook
aku tengok dia orang punya reel besar besar macam main boat punya kan
ikan todak kau nak kena bawa ni jer pokok pisang
what the fuck todak
aku tak tahu nak apa kau nak bawa pokok pisang jer bro senang
baik sia
betul kau dah pernah pergi kedai fishing yang dekat changi
bagus ah tu murah tak nampak macam murah jer
ah betul
lagi kau tak boleh nego depan orang ramai-ramai
but you kena susah tu dah kau tak suka pergi kedai ramai orang sangat kau nak nego susah because it is unethical for you to nego in front of other customers ah nanti ada customer pun nak orang itu dah tak swing
but really see how ah kalau satu customer jer
sometimes aku pernah try tau aku tengah nego but because of that one customer customer tu support aku bila aku nego sia
aku ada bilang kalau engkau bagi dia ini price aku pun beli
kau faham ah alah can lah this price I also buy from you what we buy two set leh kita pun jadi kawan macam gitu
makna orang tu terpaksa bagi ah for that price
lagi uh lagi eh lagi thirteen minutes
tak rasa english ah serious
aku hoping this one hour yang trial ni
lepas cantik-cantik so at least we can continue with the next one nanti
kan dia bayar dua belas
but bagi aku tengok macam mana at least from this trial kita tahu that that dua belas dollar dia pun akan aku rasa dia pun akan feedback
like lepas dia dengar kan dia pun akan feedback like bising sangat ke apa ke then we know what to do from there ah
okay lah bro kalau dapat at least the first two hours is thirty is thirty dollars ah dua belas dengan lapan belas
kau nak try message message dia tak like takde is it ada limit ke takde limit ke
takde limit shiok sia aku all the way sia aku buat ini
senang jer
aku it's just the problem that macam aku eh I know sometimes I hold myself from doing something
because aku tahu if I'm hook it might be a problem
for bicycle aku limit kan diri aku five hundred jer that time bila aku nak beli basikal but kau tengok berapa jual beli basikal
bro within that three months with that five hundred aku dapat dua road bike Cinelli and Giant aku jual beli jual beli last last aku beli specialised punya basikal
all and all aku spend about five hundred dollars
itu aku masih jaga-jaga diri aku tau bro aku kalau tak jaga let's say aku because I know for a fact yang basikal tu example eh
I really want to get a Santa Cruz I don't mind selling both bike and getting a Santa Cruz but aku talk crap nak top up sikit see when all this top up datang aku nak dah control diri aku and I know when I go fishing it will be the same shit I need I need small reel I aku need small uh set-up aku need big set-up nak pergi boat aku nak ada boat set-up
sama sama because you know I kita jenis orang K lah for example lah eh taruk ah drill stool
aku tahu yang aku boleh beli multipurpose punya kata yang screwdriver
yang ada plus minus all the top tu yang lagi dekat but we are the person who bukan macam gitu
kita need to get that specialised thing
faham ah like I I want the small one this is good for small one multipurpose for small dia tak bagus ah big dia pun okay okay and then aku nak lebih yang big punya separate small punya separate
you know because of this type of thing I'm trying to hold myself back unless kerja ya lah if like kau cakap dengan aku let's say kita punya kerja tak terganggu eh macam dulu eh timing baik gaji baik kan aku rasa dah mau join
but right now as of right now with the commitment dengan kita punya gaji affected
because from first session aku pergi dengan kau ya the first session yang kat bedok reservoir I still remember bro
picture perfect I still remember aku punya memory quite good
so aku tengok engkau pasang that hook jer I'm hook already kau faham ah like eh bestnya like it's it's
it's feel this hand work ah apa ini orang cakap
macam mana nak cakap eh
like handmade ah like kau tahu tak
kita suka use all that tools tools yang kecil kecil tu jadi aku tengok tu aku dah terikat macam sia lah aku nak belajar sia pasal barang ini kau tahu aku tak tahu cara pasang then I cannot I need to learn
then when I learn kau tahu lah I want to buy my own tools nanti nak beli Shimano punya toolbox tak pasal pasal nak beli Shimano punya sandal tak yang tak ada kena mengena tau bro dengan fishing
macam pakai itu sandal boleh dapat ikan lebih tu
that's why that that's why I know our be okay as easy as cycling you know sekarang aku punya focus jersey thor jersey semua kat rumah more than ten
sampai benda lima belas tu lah kemaruk sia ya lah that's me if I like something aku seldom ada hobby because I know that if I like something kan aku akan terikat kau tengok Tamiya very lucky engkau tak join aku Tamiya
kalau kau join aku Tamiya aku rasa sekarang kat rumah aku ada workshop Tamiya asal bro seriously
but Tamiya ada chance aku boleh ajar awal-awal aku
ah it seems like they scary wanna file share link yang Stargate tu dekat WhatsApp group dia share link tu dengan benda ni lah jadi aku pun teringat aku punya childhood aku terus share clear gambar Tamiya aku dia orang semua terperanjat ah
aku punya room kenji kan dah ni dah modify
ah dah modified japanese punya motor uh limited edition habis aku punya tayar rim aku tukar rim sport rim dia punya wheels yang ada printed colour putih sport rim sport wheels
so just for that I know I spend big dekat Tamiya but okay lah Tamiya for me how big can big me right
that's for now but aku tahu for a fact that fishing is if you wanna say fishing is not expensive it is an expensive play kalau if you are going for

but err as in my first day  pergi sekolah physically
first day  pergi sekolah physically
okay that one aku kena tanya achin dulu
kalau dia confirm ke tidak sebab dia tu last minute ada perangai sikit so she's always like last minute tak boleh or boleh so ya
he won't be coming because dia kerja
the best is we we need to ask them apa dia orang prefer eh is it they want to buy first or they nak order tapi kalau order pun leceh I don't think the rider can go up betul tak
then nak kena turun then kalau satu orang order lain-lain kedai
so wati jer lah belum confirm
okay so to lah ni
if the rest tak boleh make it kan I mean dayah can join lah bawa anak dia cause if if it's just the three of us
but but honestly ada orang tak suka
honestly aku cakap dengan kau ada orang tak suka
okay kau tahu kita tengah recording
okay why not kita just give
apa the leeway untuk bawa anak dia so that macam
since macam susah sangat untuk dia dapatkan orang untuk jaga kan and dia tak biasa orang lain jaga anak dia so why not
bawa jer anak dia but then engkau lah yang kena jadi macam discipline mistress
dia complain kat kau ke
okay I understand where you're coming from lah macam kau tak nak kawan-kawan kita nampak anak dia punya attitude macam gitu
kau yang last masuk aku masuk dulu so salah engkau
I mean it's a get together so might as well you you order a dessert selepas makan there's a pencuci mulut
ah then sambil tu berbual berbual gossip gossip kan
ah story story cerita cerita lama ah
ya ya aku pun perasan
maybe she just want to lead a private life lah macam tak nak share most of her personal stuff with uh us
ya like I said ada orang macam dia okay ada orang kau tahu macam
err I'm not into this kind of thing anymore macam no reunions for me I I just wanna lead and love my own family macam ya
macam senyapkan diri ke apa ya ada orang macam gitu kita kena respect juga lah kan
sorry lepas aku dah beranak ni I will need to shut you out from my life
biasa lah mister husband
so apparently achin pun nak kerja ni
like macam
insurance agent aku nak berbual

ah islamic punya
kira macam uh let's say macam prudential tapi prudential ada yang islamic punya
ah dia more to islamic punya so she pay for like two hundred dollars per month
ya and ya aku aku rasa dia punya plan is a good plan punya policy ah that's why
TAQWA is very err kira dah well known already
maybe orang-orang kau yang datang cina cina bangsa indian yang
melayu yang tak tahu pasal TAQWA because a lot of youngsters budak muda
macam around yang achin punya age and below kan ah dia orang semua go for TAQWA TAQWA is a more to macam islamic for the youngsters punya
and dia punya agent is all those macam
social media punya influencer ya

the body all still sapau lah
dia recognise kau tak
kawan dia girl ke boy sia
sekali dia cakap ya you look like totoro sia
ada any latest photo of him
oh thirty six baya safari lah
people who work as influencers selalu macam gitu like think about it singaporean pun banyak influencer pe yang like they don't really do much like you know all the pretty chinese girls on Instagram
fast paced I guess I used to play a lot of I started with um apa tu
uh I started with BlackShot then like I used to play my with friends in the computer lab when the teacher wasn't looking then we started playing BlackShot together then from then I started playing two like I got tell you before right I started playing two with my uh primary school guy friends cause we used to walk back from together then you know sama-sama right then when you get back home also we together we play like two together lah then we didn't study much but that's besides the point then uh I remember one time like he was teaching me how to
I stopped playing for a while oh no I also played Halo two at my friend's house a lot ya that was like cause you know I got primary school punya clique kan then kita used to go to his house like my friend's name is hadziq then we used to go to his house during the holidays then we would go there and we would play Halo two then how it works is that you know the screen then on top got the like player one then below got player two so it was a split screen then dah kecil kan then my like you can see the difference between people's proficiencies side by side then like I was running around trying to find my friend right cause I wanna shoot her then she was she was walking then she stop then she had to turn the other controller eh the other what do you call it joystick ya she had to turn the other joystick and then she walked then she stopped then she turned the joystick so she cause she couldn't like like like coordinate her hands or something so ya I ended up beating her a lot so
like he really he really suka macam game game lah macam gitu then he will always buy stuff like new games or like he'll put like emulators uh into his computer and stuff then you just attach the
better like it's pretty good ah I don't know if it's still that good now I guess it's just I got used to it you know dah biasa
the ratio was really off it was like twenty girls ten guys or I think nineteen girls eleven boys something like that ya it's pretty bad then they will always play together then I also was interested lah then one time they ajak me then like like we started playing together then that's why they taught me how to play PUBG
but I felt kind of bad lah I was quite a team burden back then but that's just because uh I wasn't used to the game I think but it was really fun apa tu uh selalunya selepas exam or selepas sekolah then kita just you know there's like convenience stores usually right ya then we would go there then kita makan sama-sama then after we finish like eating then we just play PUBG together lor it was nice it was like one of my favourite memories from ya ya it was damn ah it was really nice lah I like thinking about it
combination of a lot of their own consoles they just kind of improved on the design sikit-sikit
four four four or three it was I was super young then I went to uh my makcik's house siapa eh
ya so I think I stopped playing that I was thinking of getting Smash also though like I don't know I didn't know if it would translate well onto the Switch Lite or not cause I know a lot of people would prefer to play it like on the screen then some more like kalau
your friends come over or something then you know you would want to play on the big screen together I guess so that's why I didn't get Smash ya I got Mario Odyssey instead ya and then I ordered uh Stardew Valley the one that's macam uh Harvest Moon ya but I ordered it like what two weeks ago or a week ago then the store hasn't contacted me I need to them on Facebook I think
tak ah aku beli kat uh you know
ya then dia orang ada website pe so I just searched up the game there then aku cari cari cari and I think kena like they have to ship it out from somewhere else then like aku faham ah like it takes awhile to ship stuff over to singapore but like two weeks is a bit of a long time then they never contact me then they said like I went onto the website yesterday in class then I was like uh searching if they had like any issues with the shipping cause of COVID right then uh apparently if the store doesn't contact I need to contact them either on Facebook lor I need to email then I don't know do you think it's better if I email or if I on Facebook
if I send an email also maybe tak baca that's the thing right I ordered a day six album like in
days gone by punya era like the retro punya ah
aku order march kan then sekarang dah
like dah nak dekat november
ya but I don't think they meant to scam me lah I think they just genuinely forgot about it then uh I need to get a refund probably but I've already waiting so long then macam paiseh sikit to you know
maybe cause they have more people so it's more spread out I guess then maybe that's why they got more time to enjoy enjoy sikit
january like even before my birthday seh then ya it's it's so early I mean it's good lah maknanya like they get to
abeh kalau bukan april what's the on after that
I think I think I understand what the commando thing is because set lin's brother was like commando in ya in it's kind of ironic because they're not singaporean but you know as in like they weren't born in singapore ya ya they're burmese oh ya ya ya ya ya that's why his name is so weird set lin ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then uh if I'm not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when it's like going to be war lah like they're the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so that's why like when people do that's what that's that's usually what they think about lor it's like do I really want to risk my life for this certain role it's a good role like there's a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought lah like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know macam sedih lah to see to have your mother worry about you you know while they're back home ya then I remember at HeadRock
malaysia tak tahu honestly tak ada ah thailand thailand dia orang macam draw lots sia I think I remember cause apa itu bam bam went to thailand back to thailand then he was or was it ten they were like sitting together then they were like waiting for it to happen then they just draw draw draw draw the lots then after that end up both of them don't need to go
when it happened it felt macam hunger games seh honestly like why don't you just drawing why why do you gather everyone there to draw lots like just do it like I don't know in an office then hantar letter kirakan like so
so pelik to have everyone there macam
oh yang uh grave of the fireflies
itu sedih gila sia no it's because macam it's
my uh apa itu arwah nyai uh she came from indonesia then dia naik
aku ingat dulu kan it was like a big ship like a big ship then she just hopped on and then she rode to singapore but no she naik sampan sampan kecil dari indonesia jawa like she took that sampan all the way to singapore with like I don't know one like a few of my aunts and uncles my mum wasn't born yet my mum was born in singapore then she came all the way to singapore ya then like my arwah datuk was a security guard or something ya
she told me during the war like they the japanese would always like seek out very pretty girls ya so like she knew like her neighbours they would purposely macam apa eh uh mud ya they would take mud and then they would just rub it on their faces trying to make themselves look very very dirty cause they don't want to look like appear attractive to any of the japanese soldiers lah then that was quite scary then had to ration out food also that was the worst then you know my mother she used to I don't know lah like like they were really it was really really like they were really poor
then makan apa-apa jer lah cari dapat daun ke apa then ambil jer lah makan jer
ya then she but they always tried to have lauk lah like uh even back then you know
in canteens or something people selalu makan nasi taruk kicap kan but
like even back then I don't know why ah but that family of theirs they never did that they at least have like one kuah to eat together ya cause I think
even though they were poor my arwah nyai didn't want them to feel poor you know like at least have something lah had something there to eat together then ration out lor as much as possible ya
serious it was it was a sampan kecil aku I swear I ingat I thought it was like gonna be a really big ship then I talked to my sister about it then she said you realise it was a sampan right like it wasn't a big ship then I was like huh how she fit inside the sampan then she said oh like the same way everyone else does ah you just squeeze together then just hope for the best ah then can you imagine how many days that would take from freaking indonesia all the way to singapore on a sampan with other people some more
then ya then she came to singapore I mean either way they would have gone they would have gone to indonesia anyway ya but it's okay lah if my arwah nyai didn't come to singapore in that sampan I would still be
jawa so
but my mum a bit merepek seh like you know that time japan kena tsunami and like earthquake it was pretty bad right the
uh apa eh
macam tak kena ah ah
mm okay ah four hundred thousand but but still fifteen thousand out of that much is still quite a lot right then um there were a lot of people saying that they saw a lot of the spirits of the people who died ya but weren't like harmful lah they were more of like they were very lost like a lot of them said that like the hantu-hantu ini semua dia orang
I may have watched a malay drama about it like this girl was a victim and then she moved like she became like I don't know ah she had foster parents or something then she grew up with them then you kahwin orang kaya or something I don't know but anyway cause of that I learnt more about the like the thing that happened ya it was really bad like it devastated
you know cause of the water and then like kasihan lah cause
I think belum eh
ya uh for I read somewhere I think on reddit uh ada orang kata bila dia tinggal kat zone
under had more amenities or something ya or it was decorated nicer lah but at the same time it's also because has a lot of financial backing cause since they're the super majority so it's kind of like a grey area of like maybe they do want to do a lot more but they just don't have the means you know then it's kind of like I don't have the means to show you but I can show you I can't and at the same time you know mm politics macam confusing ya
I don't know why she went to when she could have gone overseas though I guess why she just wants to be back here since she was overseas for a while ya but her friends from her international school ada yang pergi uh mana
ya international school lah so they're kaya gila lagipun we were supposed to go overseas
tiga kali seh supposed to go overseas bangkok tak jadi then malaysia tak jadi then japan pun tak jadi
I think yang paling heart pain was that we couldn't see the tokyo olympics cause we were supposed to if we could have gone this year then like okay lah memang kita boleh pergi japan any other year but the problem is that we can't always go when the olympics are happening you know and then dah lah like how do we how do you even get tickets to go to the olympics
aku pun I mean like I was willing to settle for kita just stay in malaysia overnight seh or like for a few nights then to pun tak boleh literally a week before we went lucky I asked if we could get a refund or not just in case
sedih gila it wasn't even just border tutup seh border tutup then circuit breaker fuh terus my my mood just plummeted
then next year internship dengan mampus
but what options like kan that time kita tengok a few then after that is like
still macam okay lah boleh lah
I think dalam err a hundred plus ya below two hundred should be okay like I think kita total ada empat orang jer
should be lah anyway pun is
it's dekat mana
tanjong pagar boleh buat apa sia tanjong pagar ada apa
lain kan I always get them mixed up I always get them mixed up I'm just saying yes
yang ah oh that one is yang tiong bahru market kan
ya but I think more or less is confirm lah cause karim punya date pun macam
okay lah it's just satu hari jer apa right monday
anyway can there be a macam
why not cause like every time kita selalu buat like this kind of theme apa
yes ya because that one was dekat yang halia so
tanjong pagar theme apa
orang pakai good morning towels lah
kan I thought that time yang kita pergi makan then I was asking karim to decide on the matter
I don't know I don't know dia dah decide ke belum but I think that time dia ada cakap R
kat sembawang ada too bad kat sembawang ada
eh we did giant ke eh
by the way kipas tu mana
kan panas kat tempat dia
but dinner kita belum choose a place
kat kopitiam jer
nak kena lohei eh
okay kita cari father christmas
like macam
macam carousel
that's very menyemak kalau aku jadi server tu aku bingit
sibuk aku nak buat kerja sibuk kau nak order
he wanted to go there but dia kena cancel or something you know no like the location kena change or something
jonas very vegan makan
I thought we can book but tak boleh mingle
tapi yang last one makan seorang
okay lah macam homecoming ah gitu
I mean tak payah jonas pun susah kan nak makan
nanti edward complain lagi cakap should have change lah should have change lah
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel jer but date is settled lah and I think makan pun is
kat sini pun dekat kan
hotel punya room jer lah
I thought they are going to prioritise yang the elderly or like
don't know kalau dekat sana like
then like it's err pasal plants
like plant nursery with dia punya mak
then um the funny thing was dia seorang jer yang pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask so it's like huh
and ya lah dia orang punya rumah kan selalu mansion mansion berapa storey semua kan so they can afford the space but it's already like
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya dekat desert punya bukan
no no is not succulent it's like probably macam the height
no it's like macam the height of the snake plant ah
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not bukan macam kau punya this thing
it's quite bendy but then bila dia dah tua like it's quite stiff kind
yang dia beli tu is quite an old one so it's quite tall
pokok mango
ada banyak problem than benefit
especially like a globalized world right now macam kalau you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so macam there's a lot of disruptions
bukan natural way lah like like the business way the business way is that macam kena halt and and
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because macam like
you think about it all the businesses dia orang punya momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then kena halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of err during business ah so it's too soon to adapt
cause macam like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area lah but myself like ang mo kio this kind of area my banyak orang-orang tua live right then like you see those apek-apek duduk bawah block baca surat khabar that kind just like just duduk bawah block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is macam
I don't know but I feel lah macam dia orang punya
normal way of living pun kena change forcefully change so in that sense you especially bila dia orang dah like this kind of age
one thing is that dia orang pun could probably be living alone and this is their only form of macam keeping sane and err you know socialise that kind of thing like
businesses wise I think um I think between businesses and societal macam thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think kalau macam
kalau you are just suay lah then you just buka business baru then kena lockdown then macam okay lah too bad for you lah but businesses wise like you said it can be a
err just a method oh oh a matter of adaptation and how quick you are lah but then also macam those traditional businesses pun macam losing out also because
they are traditional lah like kat kedai kopi ni semua
okay lah I mean on the other hand pun macam you need to also see like macam for example cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu
but I think about limitation leh macam like for example the reason why maybe cik limah tak pergi digital is is maybe because dia punya um expertise is not there then kalau she go digital pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help dekat the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya lah but then like on her side pun macam it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then kalau let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
enforcing or like really okay lah enforcing macam a bit tough lah but like um pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
underprivileged families where you are staying macam like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
there was also this macam article I think dekat dekat mana eh
the straits times or something like that yang this um
the and all these case lah basically macam dia orang punya wifi bukannya strong kan like you know you have a lot to handle
aku tengok kat luar tingkap jer
foreign worker punya dorm kan ya
maybe I don't know like dia orang should probably lockdown in stages agaknya um
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the orang-orang tua who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
I mean orang tua like they probably don't have
it's probably just a land line dekat rumah yang ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
cause I think dekat news pun ada cakap pasal the number of domestic abusers
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite lepak
problem okay what do we talk about pasal societal business err
no ya bukannya tracks semua ada pokok
but aedes is because of air bertakung right
unless lah got one pokok pisang dekat in the middle of the north south line from yew tee to kranji
ke wild boar dekat dekat sembawang
dia orang enforce the rule people will really follow apa it's like you have all those mm mm
kau bunuh ah
apa benda kau bunuh lion tu
were these animals obtain kan and so kalau macam they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
merepek ah
remember there was this report pasal mink farm dekat mana entah
that animals roasted already lah pantang liao
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not dia punya
wait lah nanti dia dah besar dah lah letak balik kat dalam
so technically dia orang punya care is quite princess lah they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves gulung like that then they will
this thing doesn't gulung what
dia jadi go
dia jadi brown
I didn't know then no I never no lah tak jadi
ya like it cannot get cold seem like merepek ah dia just setakat satu malam jer
apa is standard pokok
ya bodoh
ya so it's a very sturdy plant dia punya leaf macam like those kind of pokok pisang punya leaves but it's err
of course right cause you are not pokok pisang
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully dia tak mati
they never like pakai those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the dabao there from container dia just scoop air gitu then dia
pail of water and pour the plant mah dia pakai watering can jer
ya I mean they will say lah like macam kalau the top all the dry then you can water that kind lah bukannya hari-hari dia water the plant
okay dah boleh start
belum is it nice
I saw like it's like metallic right macam kotak like that the design
tak lawa sia
betul lah
yeah aku nak tunggu price turun aja and then I can buy
aku dah lama tak pergi ah so macam tak ingat and I don't remember everything there
whoa so so berapa bilik
wah tinggi juga ya I thought usually I thought usually the bigger rooms will be lower
mm tapi like I think if you get city view you get sunset view
not really aku everyday aku sekarang kerja aja bangun bangun and then I just like relax for a bit and then I go go kerja
pasal ape ah
oh ini yang ada Jihyo right
itu banyak juga ah I mean it's it's normal amount of episode but if it's boring then just drop it man
eh you know the what you do for kau kau stay sana for like three days two nights kan
you let's say you booking pukul dua right
then korang buat ape
ah oh jalan jalan eh
dengan baggage semua
that one time I main layang-layang kat kat Sengkang right biasanya Sengkang ada open space before they made construction for hospital or something then like it was so windy that day I nearly hit a kid cause the kid was so close I was my mom was like okay kau eh kak you you you make the kite fly leh cause cause apparently I can fly kite quite well lah I don't know why that time maybe because very windy then the kid I turn one round the kid was so close to hitting the kite and I was like oh oh oh I like panic sia cause the mak pun sebelah dia je then I was like alamak kalau kena mati aku
me now me aku
orh berape mahal eh
yeah so total hour setengah
oh so so thirty minutes swimming thirty minutes mandi
then you kena keluar
is it then they still allow tak de lightning warning eh
is it is it now sekarang the the design is it like moon festival or what
yeah lah I mean like I had the membership a year membership because it was like twenty dollar something right I I keep going there until like I just go there for aircon only at that point because the aircon was quite cooling right dia punya aircon kan like sejuk gila nya then I was like okay let's go in relax tengok bunga okay then then I go home
wah during during pandemic was the worst lah that I have to be stuck at home boleh gila sih kat rumah dengan enam orang oof
apa you say what you say
like we wanted to go right we wanted to like plan a hotel staycay dengan kawan sekolah but then the pandemic happened and then every place just kena abandon sia
yeah man it's not even overseas people just staycay in Singapore pun susah tapi tak pe lah I think no one had money and somemore everyone like no job also
cause like she already misheard she thought thirty three hours a month then I was like that's a bit too little of hours to work to get an incentive then she recently come back to me and tell me bilang err Nisha you need to work thirty three hours per week baru boleh earn ten dollar I'm like yeah that makes more sense lah
thirty three hours per week that one is like if you work lapan hours a day for empat hari right a week you can roughly get thirty three hours like eight like as long s one day you get nine hours lah you can get thirty three hours
yeah and somemore she haven't she's not a barista yet I think at that one point Coffee Bean nak hire temperature screener right cause like they they really lacking manpower for it then they hire temporary screener first then after that they learn to become barista lah
yeah dia sekarang she she's just a temperature screener jaga burung dekat outside jer
mm yeah then after that after that she can can make drinks then I can kacau her after that
but you kau nak start sekolah soon right
yea like November ya October ah tak ingat
but then the results dah keluar eh like your whether you can get into the school
then sometimes kau pun macam malas lah nak cari lagi
yeah normal lah I mean you also not very like apa orang cakap like err what is the word ah oh main main blank like tak cerewet like that lah
are you cerewet no right you just you apply for most jobs already but like criteria doesn't mean your expectation also right
there's so many videos about it now then I I mean I played before lah aku pernah main dengan kawan poly I was like I want play seh like like I just want to play
you need you need you need minimum lima orang eh
mm can ask our secondary school punya kawan
it's very fun you know like there's this there's this girl I I must say my volley friend lah there's this she at first I thought she wasn't the intruder then dia datang she always follow me you know dia always next to me sebelah aku aje then she like suddenly swipe the knife around me and I'm like then in this game right the rule for us was that kita kena</malay>ok we were in a voice call and when we play we have to like mute our mics lah
then once someone kan dia have to like discover the body
yeah then dia report body aku then dia bilang wah I found Nisha's body here here here then I'm like then if you dead you cannot talk in our game then I'm like oh my god this this this girl this then I just keep maki on the other side because they can't hear me right then I just keep maki her like wah this this girl ah she's lying so well ah and everyone was like so who's the killer who's the killer I'm like ugh it's her it's her she's she lied so well you know then I'm like ugh I hate I hate her I hate playing with her
then got there's also another one where I'm the intruder with this other person the girl that lying very well I was the intruder with her then after after err intruder can like like kacau dia punya system right like you can like disrupt their system then they had the members have to fix the two things lah so the system will go back up then so when everyone has to go to this location to fix it because you have to like press your hand dekat machine itu lah
yeah lah cause this one you can like ada van then you can like apa ada mission juga you can see everyone instead I would mafia game kan macam kau kena tunggu the time only
then it's quite it can get quite  macam bosan lah
same like when we when it was the birthday party for mine recently kalau kita semua main UNO semua right it was it was quite fun lah honestly
I'm hungry man I like oh you're craving for meat ah but you're not a meat person right kau tak boleh makan
kenyal-kenyal ox man
I I won't be surprised right if you dah kawin then kau beranak kan then you like beef suddenly
are kau serius ke
funny lah usually pregnancy kan macam unknown unknown cravings
I thought I thought you said kalau the ikan is pregnant and people don't like and I'm like that doesn't make sense
oh my god I want I want I recently was talking to Yin Shen about picnic then suddenly nak dia nak main layang kan because since that last year want play layang already
then I was like oh can we go picnic then then he said like okay kau nak join tak we go picnic but
what but what apa
like currently dia nye holiday bulan eh it's this month it's this month like on the twenty eighth of September if we pergi Isnin
okay I think next week then we next week next next week next next week next next week then we can bincang
dia orang dia orang selalu dia orang uni course sama eh
no I'm saying like their course from poly to uni sama
they dia orang selalu nak jumpa buat ape
no lah I mean you can meet lah but if you wanna meet every week macam penat kan nak meet like you already tired from uni then they still wanna meet
I mean they were they were nice enough to tunggu tunggu kau punya reply lah
is it I mean I guess I mean secondary school of course more easier to handle this food thing compared to poly punya kawan lah like I also got bad experiences with like kawan poly semua nak makan yang tak halal punya benda then I'm like okay you guys go ahead then they are like why you never follow then it's like no brainer what you guys nak makan yang tak halal then then kau invite aku buat apa kan
I hate it I aku tak aku tak suka eh paling benci aku when I hear that kind of phrase then I'm like yeah you you can't eat here then we buy side for you or something else no wah I I had a debate with that with Chris for the longest time you know like can't say that it's just not nice you know if you want eat eat together if not don't eat it at all that kind of thing
I'm like wah paling benci sia aku dengar apa that that phrase
I mean I don't I mean I I okay with them but when it comes to certain hangouts right nak nak jumpa dua orang like that I like I don't wanna really meet them anymore
yeah it's like you waste your time and effort keluar rumah pakai lawa lawa then kena pakai bus nye card lagi bus transportation for adult fare is so much
eh kak aku tanya eh kalau naik bus kan straight okay let's say I want go to A to B then aku naik bus aja is it cheaper than changing from bus to or what
yeah cause like kalau aku naik bus satu jam eh if I take also around forty five fifty minutes kan it's around the same time tapi like which one will be cheaper
yeah but I feel like if if I was the person cause her her topic was what technology dengan benda lain kan I don't know ah Singapore technology thing then I'm like okay I think I would cater more towards the disability
tapi nak tunggu bus tengah crowded is a bit I don't want to pay extra money for this
hmm but the thing is you don't know if they're really disabled like usually the more the the ones that you can see is the one dengan anjing kan
um especially nak naik nak naik ape transportation kan public transport
nak senang kan diorang nya apa diri
yeah we're so used to having five senses susah nak compare dengan orang lain pun nak susah juga lah like we always kasihankan but we never do anything right
forest fire not fighting fire api
so apparently recently or is it this week or last week ah there is a forest fire kat California or Oregon and it was caused by a gender reveal explosion
it is so stupid diorang tak pakai otak eh it's like during summer somemore you know then they do this kind of stupid things
it's still happening now it's I think it's for few days then diorang kan kita nampak langit kan biru lawa their langit is red eh
yeah but imagine leh like it's so stupid you'd rather waste environment things over your damn child's gender what then sekarang pun macam you know I I like okay whatever people born to be lah that kind of thing they wanna be bi whatever I'm okay with it then like what what if the gender is not what their gender is supposed to be there's a lot of like debate on it
wah what if then they knew when they dia were they planning your name to be different
yeah confirm for that nine months right diorang macam ingat nak nak namakan untuk lelaki right then suddenly perempuan keluar then they on the spot have to think of a girl name leh
over the top maksudnya apa
know yesterday aku kerja kan sorry I keep changing topic then yesterday aku kerja thought it will be crowded lah cause Thursday gonna be Friday so I thought will be crowded can you guess how much I earned for I I work at F&B lah can you guess how much I earned for the whole shift
tak sampai tiga puluh aja
none I get seven dollar per hour right then I only make sales tiga puluh dollar aja or less than that twenty seven I think
yeah I thought okay lah at at first I thought airport will be crowded then when the last customer left around seven forty five I had to quickly like sweep and mop right cause sometimes overcrowded kan tak ada time nak sweep mop then you leave then you leave work late right
then I quickly sweep and mop until eighty fifty cause no one then I just wait and wait and wait until pukul sembilan eh then I'm like should I wash the air fryer now or should I wait cause sometime last minute also got Grab then aku tunggu aje lah tunggu kan in the meantime I just make like takeaway waffle
dah tunggu sampai sembilan setengah tak da orang eh I was like okay I just close up everything ah
kan like err don't know you should be happy or not like I'll be I mean for boss profit is addicting right this one is like I feel like I'm earning more than how much I how much I get profit from the ShopBack leh tiga puluh dollar eh it's like twenty seven eh I was like oh my god this is this this is easy money
I I guess so if you like if for the previous two days if kau macam busy gila macam selalu ada ramai orang then suddenly one day you just just quiet your body kind of just like zone out
eh then nyari Kelly kerja eh
but usually Friday ramai orang ah like it can hit incentive very very easily then I like I cannot I don't want do Friday cause I I hate I hate it that is only one person then I've to clean up everything
I save the earl grey cake sedap eh
aku ingat Andrew buat pasal dia selalu masak kan kat rumah kan buat baking semua

I don't know I don't know when you'll ever use someone's face on your shirt like you'll probably wear it at home you don't kau tak kan nak keluar dengan baju dengan idol kau kat right like you feel very self-conscious I would feel self-conscious lah
pasal dia cause he looks like a damn cloud
eh they also making like the the the other pushies right plushies yang yang dia nya macam enemy

oof the thing that I want err you know sometimes I like to draw right then I like to support other artist punya art then the art itself cost like lima belas dollar aje then then their shipping tiga puluh dollar and I'm like oof tak payah lah aku simpan gambar dia online aja lah sakit hati eh nak beli dengan shipping macam tu
tiga puluh dollar dah already the cheapest then they gave me FedEx one lah then I'm like okay no no that one seventy plus already cannot afford this
oh sekarang tak de eh
that's why it's like that's a lot of money to like kacau orang on the website
I can boleh pakai untuk makanan ke baju ke for yourself kan then go around kacau orang only
kat mana online
dua belas okay what
is it the shipping yang mahal atau or what
oh then you got extra fund then you kau kau pakai lah
eh tell me the shop eh I also want to tengok-tengok
yeah what to do life kan kerja is kerja
kau nak countdown ke tak payah
tak apa I think for now kita kena err try our best to talk to fill in the one hour ahead
yes okay so apa yang sulaiman Twitter macam mana nak start
okay so basically sejak dulu I've always wanted to go to the kampung nak stay the night tapi sulaiman dah ajak so tak dapat tidur overnight cuma setakat gi mancing overnight then aku ni expert pergi sana without any proper clothing
and uh the the dah jadi mangsa to all these sandflies that's why right now you can see that I'm wearing all these sleeves to cover my aurat
err I went to the one that is nearer to to sulaiman's house juga lah it's it's just a
kalau jetty tu jauh jetty tu is really quite a distance this one is yang kat belakang kampung you'll be able to walk to this particular part of the beach then kat sana kita gi cast our rods lah
no that time was all the way to jelutong that one is all the way at the other end of the island yang ni betul-betul kat belakang kampung melayu
tak tahu orang melayu kan
okay you need a best part err banyak petuk tapi is just yang ikan yang aku tunjuk tu ah yang ikan tudung periuk
or in english we say the spotted sequel fish ya tapi ikan tu the story lagi best
aku dah mancing aku sengaja feel nak reel in tapi bila dah dapat eh tiba-tiba ganas betul-betul kau dapat rasa lawan bila kita dah angkat aku panggil sulaiman to come and check then all of a sudden kita tengok kat dalam dia punya mata kail kan betul-betul sangkut kat hidung
betul-betul on the nose
then the rest of the night tak ada ikan
kita jumpa dekat singapore so the the asal before kita jumpa sekeluarga
then dia datang naik grab bila dia claw grab ingat dia keluar gi bazaar ke apa
betul-betul keluar barang one by one ada claw back trolley besar satu bakul satu err bawa langsir
nak tukar langsir dekat dalam rumah dia then actually the next day more fun keluarga dia datang the next day dia nya extended relatives lah dia datang bawa tiga
connections lah kalau sebab kalau sulaimannya family yang dia punya extended family ni memang satu orang tu driver so kalau coincidentally dia dapat arrange with the driver senang lah tak payah bayar tambang free of charge
okay so kita dah sampai kampung sulaiman get everything ready six o'clock then salin baju semua
err that's what made me worried lah tengok dia dah pakai all full suit but I have nothing like am I supposed to prepare something on my end then terus
initially no intention tapi bila dah nampak sulaiman keluarkan joran tu the intention came out lah
six twenty five kita gerak then from there kita jalan all the way to that spot
we we actually walk all the way to this part of the dam ya actually macam where you get all the air keluar masuk then bila air pasang semua macam marina barrage lah and then you get on top of the stone then sulaiman cakap wan err ni part gerek tau bila high tide kita tak boleh keluar tau
kau kau nak tak abeh aku cakap go jer ah don't scared then betul-betul bila high tide eh terus sulaiman pointed at me wan tengok terus kita dah surrounded kiri kanan air pasang besar
then at first macam mula-mula tak boleh understand lah like the the depth of the air tapi bila air surut
once you see that low tide dia punya drop from the top of the dam to the bottom seram sia dua dua tingkat yes
so macam dari jauh tak nampak tapi betul-betul because of that that err concrete structure bila dah air tumpah bawah jatuh dalam seh
ya so basically macam this man-made structure is like very far away from the beach so there's this path yang kita kena jalan atas
then err ada from there is like a hill downwards lah so from there ada slope to err to bakau-bakau sini and after that we had to climb on certain bricks to get onto the structure so bila air pasang
the whole valley below semua ni semua covered so it's just us on this on this structure
so that time I think lucky lah sebab I think the tide was supposed to be three metres plus then the highest eh
betul-betul macam sini tau then dia cakap man kalau get any higher how aku cakap macam tu lah wan
takde there's no is open is basically your marina barrage bridge is basically the same logic as that thing
I think next time you go there confirm kau try juga high tide got stranded for like we were stranded for I think a good six hours six hours err because
air naik pasang baru pukul sepuluh but the coast too low then after that we were there until
pukul empat pukul empat dia dah naik sepuluh malam ya then after that pukul satu
tu apa was the highest then after that betul-betul tengok eh kita literally sia
macam tsunami betul-betul tengok bila air pasang air surut ombak dari luar masuk dalam
tak juga okay itu best okay this part censored sikit bila nak kencing kita ada satu spot
satu spot on the whole man-made structure kita technically I will consider this macam the north eastern part of it
away from the laut tapi towards the kampung
habis tu ada lah tengah rilek terus dengar ada kat belakang what what's that noise jangan pandang belakang oh
two three times because there's nothing much to do but sulaiman what he did most was he he makan some Pringles lah
okay so sulaiman dia dia tunjuk something this one is about naz yang recommend
dia ada satu backpack ni dia jadi tempat duduk
kirakan macam backpack punya the the sponge tu dia punya padding you can actually convert into a seat then after that sulaiman just duduk jer atas
but for my end ini tempat legend aku tak ada benda then um sulaiman punya mum cakap wan err kau tengok kau belakang ada ke tak
then I I I find this yang the simple basic students yang lipat yang buka tutup boat
so it was already like decomposing and then after that I just sat down and then kita testing dulu lah kat kampung tapi bila kita testing kan mesti nak kena fragile sikit tapi bila dah kat laut duduk sekejap aku ingat kayu yang raput tapi the whole boat collapsed
mana oh jelutong uh uh mm pulau ketam
dapat duit I don't know dapat joke the ikan
johan eh bukan ke
ikan johan ke I've heard ikan johan before dia macam ikan duri tapi besar
itu johan is like the middle leh it feels so weird
ikan duri apa tu jahat uh huh uh huh
I thought johan tu ikan keli besar pe oh
six duris so all the yang middle medium lah no jahans
that's why ah bento I wanna say jaring
net net lah jaring lah I'm just gonna say jaring or jala ah jala alright
ni pancing malam ke pagi overnight oh
ni COVID ke no
ah cause I thought the uncle was the one who bring you all the way right baiknya express
dah bayar lebih bawa lebih weh
mm mampus mampus
is it like the normal crabs or macam ketam-ketam bakar begitu
wah flower crabs yang kat pasar selalunya fuyoh the ones you get blue or brown
if blue if I'm not wrong is male tak ada telur ya brown usually is yang female lah
scary horror yes mampus okay carry on carry on
I wan two or wan three I wan three right mampus alright
orh pulau ubin juga okay okay
eh apa ni ah
tu lah mine mine I I wear arm sleeves you can't see but it's it's poking through lah poking through
but okay in terms of azan eh because this one also the same thing happened to me that time when I go with sulaiman but the the thing is uh not the spot but basically in the kampung melayu juga when we are back at home it was betul-betul subuh time lah
then when I was outside I thought like somebody was you know playing on the radio azan or quran
but then when I go outside I literally stand in the middle semua gelap I just stand in the middle and then I faced towards malaysia lah then I can really hear surau kat sana tengah playing eh tengah playing pula eh tengah tu lah tengah prepare tengah solat subuh
then for the first time macam the whole kampung betul-betul every subuh eh I think this one has to be like every day ah everyday in pulau ubin ada jer quran playing
so there's always quran throughout the whole island boleh dengar because kampung it's from malaysia lah you can hear from malaysia
so that means because because I think probably memang isolated then there's nothing to block except the trees then I can only suspect is the surau if I'm not mistaken is the masjid kampung pasir puteh
so white sands literally dekat malaysia ya then that masjid is when we look at the map
is quite close to by right the side so your area pulau ketam should hear it louder than kampung melayu
and ya lah so yang okay so yang pulau ketam is it the one that has this two storey building is that your spot
ya kenapa seh mana ada
tadi in the beginning I already say in the beginning in the beginning I already say a lot of malay so that's why right now I am trying my best to try to
campurkan melayu sikit with the english but when I try to put in the melayu I understand that I hesitate a bit jadi terkaku lah
habis bila dah focused then err then all the sentence everywhere
jadi kita try our best to not really mix everything lah cause that's that's against what they want us to do pe
ah yes ada kisahnya all
kalau dapat ke tak dapat bilang jer lah but instead you just keep the okay one of the things this one I can say lah because I think one month dah over pun
err I applied for this err safe distancing err ambassador at masjid omar salmah
so that one is the I think to me is the most saddest because it is the most yang kasi harapan because
when they called me I was at Sheng Siong and and then my they called the worst time cause I was supposed to pay but then they called me and then I answered the phone and my mum terpinga-pinga lah macam ni nak bayar ni
ya ya then for me I was err I just answer the call then cakap hi err assalamualaikum err err is this shazwan on the line
then I cakap ah yes may I know who is this dia cakap oh I am from masjid muhajirin mula-mula aku fikir aku apply masjid omar salmah asal why is it yang masjid muhajirin yang call
then I realise ah because err this thing is by right ada muhajirin but they need someone to err cover omar salmah so they called me everything then they asked to clarify certain parts of my resume
then aku explain to them lah yang okay aku ni dua puluh empat tahun
she ask the question tahu ke tak yang this place is very far very ulu ada transports sendiri ke tak then I said no but I've seen the map I can still walk there fifteen minutes lah
within the week so sekarang dah satu bulan
and there's still nothing so that's why I say this kind of thing eh like like at least bilang lah like don't keep the person waiting cause I was actually hopeful maybe
this is the rezeki I've been waiting for ya ke tak it's not it's not the one so that's why I'm like
err it's not it's tak baik lah tak baik
I think I think I think that one is the worst lah okay so to talk about sakit hati this one I don't know if if kita jaga aib ke tak jaga aib because it it it involves masjid juga
so so recently I I think for for for confidentiality I will not name the masjid
but I will say the proximity of the masjid the masjid is in the east so this masjid he surrounding dia has quite a few other masjids
yes so this is a part of singapore yang ada banyak masjid quite near each other ah if you knows what I'm talking about
ya but it's not the one that you probably think about is one of the masjid yang kat dalam-dalam sikit okay it's one it's definitely tak tak famous lah which is why lagi aku fed up
the whole story is yang mula-mula I got this call from this err person from I would say the communications department lah
kan so the communications department suddenly call me on monday afternoon saying um assalamualaikum shazwan err saya nik ni err
I understand from this person that you are helping us to design a poster so first of all in my mind siapa sia ni terus cakap since when am I helping to design a poster
for that time no because the way they say we have a deadline by wednesday is like err we are urgent lah urgent can you help us in my mind cakap
aku tak cakap benda I didn't I didn't want to be on board tapi the way you say macam kesian juga ini masjid
but the thing is that I don't like or don't agree on is that he just mentang-mentang kasi my
I did the poster so the poster was everything you know me lah my style is everything I do on Powerpoint then bila aku dah buat semua they they ask me
the first thing they asked is can you find the photos yourself of the of the asatizahs mentioned then aku fikir aku memang lah bukan orang alim
tapi who are these ustaz I don't know these ustaz what if I type the same ustaz and I put ustaz nama nama ustaz different person I wouldn't know also what
so that's why luckily I have this friend secondary school friend lah kita
aku minta tolong dia sebab dia pun by right macam orang masjid lah
and he he managed to provide me yang gambar-gambar betul lah so alhamdullilah so what I do is I just take the photos then I do the caricature lah basically it's just copy paste edit the shape
and make a cartoon version of the asatizah and the guest speaker so the guest speaker
yes so so that's why I say this masjidnya sebab apa
ada pula panggil fandi ahmad so I already did the design err I understand that the communications officer sebenarnya dia orang muda
so dia actually understand my style dia pun suka my style but of course kita akhirnya when it comes to all these things higher ups the final say then err
I think the the funniest argument is that one of the people on top say um aku rasa ada problem because I think later they are scared that because when it comes to this
so by right even for me lah when it comes to the hierarchy of such an event kita selalu moderator dulu you need a moderator to moderate then you have the speakers or your guests
so for me my logic is because of space constraint juga I put it in diagonal manner I put the moderator up here then the asatizahs together
and then I got fandi ahmad but the person who viewed this thing said err do you think it might be offensive to the asatizah that the moderator who is of lesser rank is higher
then in my mind aku fikir asatizah boleh fikir macam tu ke is that is that healthy for you to say eh aku lebih alim pe is that actually healthy sangat
but then he say but from left to right is the moderator is still first and then asatizah and then fandi ahmad would you think that the moderator because he is first in line he is of higher rank
that's why I say eh if I macam tu I I put circle pun you will find somewhere to start semua mesti salah punya right
we understand we know it's just that the higher ups refuse to listen ni yang susah orang tua tak nak dengar orang muda so the explanation is okay but I still feel ah that's it that's it so once that happens
err game lah so I I really at that time memang macam upset lah but the oh the final blow right is that yesterday
they they give it to the chairman chairman cakap okay okay go published Facebook Instagram published it was published I saw it
on Facebook and Instagram at eight dia pun bilang aku that timing and then after that the next day tiba-tiba the officer called me
that the pictures of asatizah are made into cartoons and then ya alah I fikir
but it's just is is is an effect I never made the nose bigger ke telinga besar ke is not I think but then the person that commented said it is offensive
to have the asatizah drawn as a cartoon then aku fikir balik ni macam kenapa nak terperinci sangat
ya so that's why in this situasi you can actually see
that orang tua is not very flexible they understand everything then
I really apologise for this thing um boleh tak
err kita delete all of your all of the drawings that you did and just put in the actual picture of the of the asatizah in my mind I was like
then the past three nights you asked me to make the last minute changes on the faces buat cantik-cantik bring it bigger make the font smaller
semua tu means nothing lah he say just delete everything just use the original photo can already
cakap we know of someone who can help us for free ah without consulting me or informing me at all
that is why bila aku dah tau dah find out who is the one responsible my Whatsapp was panas I literally texted
but only after I finished my poster I said err salam semua this is the poster that I have done
nanti tiba-tiba jer nama dah masuk dalam for benda-benda yang kita tak tahu pun apa nak kita nak buat
ah memang so so right now the thing is on that end the poster is still down is still taken down but
yang mereka masih persistent to make sure it's photos but I've already made it clear to the officer I'm sorry but I will not make any more changes because I feel disappointed I said it just just just blurt it out
and then the officer say I understand where you're coming from so I will still try my best to to err macam tukar err pemikiran orang-orang atas lah
cakap to understand that this doesn't this shouldn't offend people like how you think it will offend people because it's just
it's just a caricature tapi kita pun nak kena tengok logic tau the logic is the poster I did it because I I was informed of the age group
the age group was aimed for twelve to eighteen year olds kalau let's say you err
secondary school lah kau tengok gambar macam comic and gambar macam real mana satu yang kau macam more wah this one seems more interesting
so itu yang kelakar dia ni bahan lawak dia communication in the beginning pun tak kasi tau they never even inform me that I was supposed to do this thing
that's why I I I sound them all then betul-betul cakap I'm sorry I know I shouldn't have done this is it's unprofessional on my end I hope you may forgive me
then terpaksa lah kita forgive
tapi when they start saying oh by the way shazwan err can you just put the original picture ah that's it done I'm out thanks for nothing
because I mean to be fair juga lah if let's say you paid me and then I say this thing memang unprofessional of me because you already pay me but this part is that
you already say that I'm a volunteer know I mean I am forced ikhlas ke tak ikhlas so
that's the that's the sad part lah which is why it reminded me of the of the time yang dulu
kita ni kalau buat design ni freelance never do for free
mm itu lah
so that's why like when it comes to people always asking the designers to make changes macam for them is so easy that's why like
even for me there's always that moment cakap kalau senang senang kau buat lah sendiri what you mean so easy do yourself
itu lah that's why that's why even for me that's why I don't do freelance job because of this simple fact when you say I like it but can you no
then okay itu lah kadang-kadang kita fikir balik manusia ni semua menyakitkan hati
err even for you err folks over there that is listening in that is tuning into our err podcast terima kasih
kerana sudi mendengar kita err dah tak ada cerita cerita tu ada sebenarnya everything has been a true story believe it or not
ya lah tadi sebelum ni kita pergi bubble tea we we went to the bubble tea shop we went to we went to buy so just now like the initial story on the topic of
pelik lah but you know for the benefit of your program the thing that you are trying to do kita kita sudi tolong
sudikan masa kita pada malam sabtu ni untuk err tolong ah which is interesting because in english we say friday night tapi kalau like in in malay
err malam jumaat malam jumaat is thursday so the logic eh if you you if you're curious is that sebab kita
so maghrib is when we start our day so that's why for hari raya ah if you are also curious why we don't err fast
on the last day eh sorry why we don't pray on yang malam terakhir itu is because only hari raya
ya now dah start merepek tapi tu lah kalau kita asyik berbual for forty eight minutes straight kan these things will pop up I'm pretty sure we are not the only
err people the only participants yang err bual benda-benda merepek especially towards the the later part of this err
podcast err I wanted to say project which is the thing lah but for us we gonna treat it as podcast already lah kita betul-betul tak tahu nak bual apa lah kan
ada lah got lah got okay alright
muka selamba eh cakap one thousand
gitu gitu tak apa ah thank you it's okay
fikir mana eh want to be prime minister tak apa it's okay
okay tak apa
typical jer ada kau kita pergi tak ada kau kita potong
aduh terima kasih lah sekarang kita tinggal cuma lapan minute jadi in this final eight minutes kita boleh doa sekarang
buat it slow lah nak panjang ke nak pendek ah
when it comes to the next steps we need to know what's the next step if it's a little bit too much takpe thank you
should be okay lah because you wanted singlish singlish is basically err orang bangsa macam-macam bual bahasa macam-macam together rojak and then that's that's our language our pride and honour
pride kita tak boleh record lagi lah dah tutup
jadi six minutes yes
uh pasal apa pula Grab oh okay jap oh jap
mm mm lapan puluh eh macam tu cepat
and this one we will cover in two minutes don't worry this one is I went for the hike to from my house aku jalan kaki guess to where
apa kamu cakap change the last part again yes
aku pun tak tahu berapa click basically that then go down marina barrage gardens by the bay marina bay sands five one eight balik rumah tidur
I usually go out at five asar five sampai balik rumah nine thirty
eh you underestimate my stamina ke brother I walk from from my house to east coast one hour
five tapi kau nak ke
park your motor at marina bay sands and then you take the downtown line ah downtown line to here okay jom then after you send me back home
actually kan aku tak because uh mak aku like whenever she cook she will buka the YouTube punya
apa tu video ya because dia tak ada Spotify so she will use the YouTube ah while she cook
tapi macam a bit merepek cause last time can misteri jam dua belas kat radio kan so you listen to it at night literally before twelve but ni dia tengok bila tengah macam petang cause tengah masak kan you had any stories on your
kau kau dengar
ya ya the when one yang you were studying at home kan
aku aku weh pun nak dengar ah
keras kan ya
how sia because that time I I didn't know how keras it was until I came aku balik lambat that time because the the tempat that I live kan is betul-betul opposite the
benda-benda tu the and the muslim world
and then dia macam dalam tau sebelah ha the best part tempat aku tinggal is betul-betul sebelah fuchun primary
no no the one that I'm staying in sekarang ya
aku tak tahu aku tahu dia marsiling
the one yang opposite the tu
the the police dengan muslim world
tak ah yours is dalam lagi sikit
ya sebab tu yang tadi pagi yang aku
bangun masa extra awal lah cause I thought it was late but the the bus stop is literally dekat depan like depan block ah so I took
nine six six direct straight all the way pergi I'm like ah I came here within forty five minutes
ya but it's only untuk tiga minggu jer
entah I don't know my parents my family is living there like we just take a rental
ya so after the three weeks then kita boleh masuk the new house lah
ya ya ya betul-betul next to ya fuchun section primary so I think it's the new one ya by tak tu kat
ya tu aku tu aku tak berani because the next bus kan yang pass by that tempat ya I saw like oh
ya I'm like okay tak apa aku tak nak pergi sini
macam mana kau masuk the sekolah like is it they give you
like is it like macam kalau secondary school kan like dia orang kasi like that booklet kan untuk uh like you can either apply directly atau you go through the system kan then for primary apa like kau apply directly or
kau fikir ni TOTO ke apa
that one aku tak tahu ah because their
so that's what your what your parents bid ah ya but ya and hantu
mmhmm kau primary school ada cadet
apa seh tu korang kena belajar history
huh founder kat singapore
ya betul lah ya
asal oh okay
because my school punya like very limited so dia orang cuma ada like sports
uh apa lagi eh
I think that's about it and then when bila aku baru nak graduate then dia offered arts
so like dari like from primary school uh I was in track and field uh apa nama benda tu tak tak it's not netball
aku tengok home econs aku macam apa kau orang belajar kat sini ya they learn how to cook there was a competition for cooking
home econs belajar apa
oh aku dengar for like for the exam you literally have to cook
like oops tak apa darurat
oh no they say like kalau ha you can it's like god purposely let you makan because ya five minutes
I never studied music so bila aku kat poly kan
because in poly I joined the percussion punya band
and then there was this one part of the test where the instructor ajar kita orang how to read music tapi aku lost gila ya
aku lost because like he was teaching us like paradiddle ke apa entah how to do the how to keep how to macam ha stay in beat and listen to the rhythm ke apa because our instructor tu was from yuhua punya like some band thing ah
aku just lost so dia macam we had to pass the test and we had to learn how to draw the symbols semua a'ah
okay lah aku aku pass the paper lah but the actual practical aku macam huh
dengan flute kan tak eh
oh oh that's recorder oh aku teringat squidward clarinet
tu bukan gong lah merepek
the what rebana
oh that one is like dia macam xylophone gitu kan it's something like that lah tapi dia like circle circle
but ya kau jadi apa malay dance
fusion macam mana kau joget sia
handball aku tak tahu uh huh
actually lah at first macam macam malas kan but then after awhile then you're like okay
camp qiam ah
uh I think ada lah because we had this program in primary six yang eh kaki kau ada semut
uh and then apa tu that one kita it's like uh like you know those masa adam khoo punya camps
everytime ada camp kan mesti ada that night walk tau ya and then before night walk they will always show you cerita hantu tau atau cerita seram before that so for that for that one they showed us uh movie the orphan I think
honestly aku tak ingat because
it was quite scary because the sekolah that we had to go was wak tanjong ya then wak tanjong kan it's like
macam kampung lama right I think it was like rumah orang ah dulu
ya then so macam we had to crawl over stuff and benda semua tapi aku mesti teringat mesti ada hantu kat sini something like haunted house ah ya
mm then dia orang cakap ah macam if kalau if you see anything uh you try to find the
facilitator ah because they have a glow stick I'm like habis kalau facilitator benda lain macam mana
oo yang army I think the first episode ke second episode
oh ah yang bila dia baru masuk eh habis dia kena bully kan cause mak dia hantar dia a'ah
tu kat tekong eh tak eh kat mana seh
oh macam apa tu like ha caterpillar baru nak cakap train
so korang apa masuk alam bunian
ya is it korang like got trapped
in the tempat eh
macam dah nak siap to tidur ah
ya korang you take some time lah ya
tak which makes me think sebab sebab like kau tahu nak cakap bugis kan ada this tempat where
uh that road is called uh jalan kubur
ya basically sebelah aljunied right so like the entire stretch semua kubur tau and then it's very like rapat-rapat
it's literally next to the madrasah it's the I think the the founder of the sekolah punya family aljunied ya
oh because that used to be dia punya tempat ah like is it like the ha the tanah or the kampung where most of them tinggal kat situ ah
aku macam no because aku baru perasan kan because that time I I was going home and then aku nak pergi bus stop then so I went to the bus stop
literally belakang bus stop tu so macam
sini ada kubur-kubur then bus stop kat sini so kalau kau nak pergi bus stop you have to pass by the kubur ah
I didn't I was like how can it be that close seh tak seram ke
and macam I
ya is it dia orang tak perasan ke dia orang tak kesah
oh yang tu lah
tak seram seh because when I went to the bus stop it was dah malam
and then aku macam it was very like seram ah aku just tengah jalan minding my own business and then pergi bus stop aku nak cari bus and aku tengok tepi I was like eh kubur
kena culik eh
kenapa bau bau bangkai eh
ke just bau tanah like fertiliser
kat luar kan bye
asal eh is it dia punya no no no as in the tempat tempat mandi dia is like covered eh or is it like open air oh so kirakan dia just macam panel lah
it's a kolah right
ya tak comfortable lah
is it a real thing though it's not right I heard like it's orang eh
is it someone hantar jin or is it orang tu sendiri is the one
the what oh they send benda tu ah
actually kan aku ada question we're because hantu raya kan dia actually apa
what is it asal why is it called raya
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because ada this one episode where
ada this group of students dia pergi this one area kat
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the tempat kan
uh they dia orang
I don't know if it's a bomoh but I think and then she macam advice dia orang kan dia dia she advise them about the macam pantang larang gitu and then
a'ah yang tu yang tu ha ya
apa eh oh they they call it
nananggal tak salah
no no they the it's nananggal not penanggal
eh aku tak tahu ah cause oh
oh apa they malay peninsular so sama hantu lah
it's because when I first saw it kan oh chey okay no because I thought at first it's a pontianak but then the cerita tunjukkan kan because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
ya kat singapore
aku tak pernah nampak okay okay then
which makes me wonder tau because kan dia orang patut kan they can go through
like solid objects tak boleh affect them kan tapi they get stuck
oh amal pengamal oo
tu yang aku tak faham like you would take you would pay lots of money
to apa tu get the services of
like jin dengan bomoh tapi like benda surgery kau tak nak
ya apa yang natural it's supernatural
seram ah wait then what's the purpose of the penanggal like
I know oh the I don't know what's the purpose tapi aku tahu like dekat episode tu they show
um that thing was going after the perempuan yang pregnant
I know because like one reasons is because macam like they are more vulnerable and then they are macam mana eh
like they are more vulnerable because they ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat
so they try to like steal it from them which is apa tu the baby lah it's like new life
a'ah ya ya ada ada
I mean kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua
ya itu that one just
because they they either makan the anak atau they curi the anak atau they ikat the rahim eww
ya like finally I know what's the purpose of that eh dia letak garam kan tak eh garam
ya aku dengar like if you letak garam kat luar your pintu kan macam anyone ha anyone who masuk rumah kalau dia ada simpan benda kan that benda cannot masuk rumah
maybe ah it's one of the ways ah yang ada
sirih eh
apa seh aku tak pernah dengar is it melayu punya
apa seh
oh kirakan macam
they make it into a sabun kan so senang
sambut what do you mean
eh a'ah a'ah apa tu yang the son of a peach punya cerita kan they were saying macam this hospital dia cakap
uh dia tengah beranak kan and then she saw a white figure then the nurse cakap oh that one is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
so kirakan macam kalau like you give birth
but then someone benda lain might be
cause thinking macam sebab maternity work kan like babies baru keluar
so it's seram seh but then kalau macam you are if you are in the operating room kan and then kau baru give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
oh that's why that one macam make sure kalau kau kat dalam kan you have someone like your family there so they can ha okay okay
oh but then masih baru kan the
oh ya ya ya tidur mati ah
kau tak baca doa tidur eh asal eh
oo so if it wakes you up then different story ah ha bodoh lah
but apa yang dia call it apa err it's not khayalan it's like
ya betul
the he looked up the stuff kan then he saw that actually jin dengan you cannot see jin and syaitan because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya so what happens is that because kau kena apa tu hasut kan
macam is just playing in your head so the syaitan hasut you and then kirakan they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension tau everything that exist in that dimension
ya macam that's why macam you nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak kan ya
also orang lain yang kena ah
kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita okay
wait so that's one of the ways they kacau you ah
so kirakan dia orang actually pegang kau or they just make you think that ada orang pegang kau
ha dia orang selalu buat kan macam like those supernatural punya like
ya I remember I watched the one yang kat malaysia kan where they the the whole entire team
kat luar rumah and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like baca-baca something basically like inviting the hantu gitu ah
ya but then it's like damn scary because apa tu
like the the thing will come to them right and then apa tu
macam mana eh the the pintu semua gerak and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to dia punya the team outside right
like usually when they go out they we have like a a bomoh on standby gitu ya
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like dia orang macam trembling or shivering or they say like dia orang ada rasa benda
ya why ah is it like singapore like dia orang tak kacau sangat
so you telling me that the hantu also like shifted back to the kampung then oh it became less popular eh less demand
oh I think it's because like is it like people in singapore tak practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources juga ah ya really like maybe ada memang ada lah but like
and like the pantang larang for bomoh right is more
ya it's so leceh satu and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it kan but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
like kan dia cakap tak boleh you cannot walk under the galah but then kat kampung dulu dia orang pakai galah kot
I I thought they use the clothes line the string tak eh
and kenapa galah like aku aku tak faham huh what's that
properties ah then what if it's made out of metal atau plastic
no bila macam those extendable galah kan that one made of metal what no meh
like you will perah the thing first what before you gantung
kau tau jemur ke apa ya
so kirakan like when you absent-mindedly walked under the galah lah ha
what's eh wait but for susuk kalau terkeluar you can just masukkan balik kan
it's macam mana eh it's it's this actual peniti kan something like that
I know like there used to be this show dekat suria where
where they show no not cerita hantu it's
err they ya ya so one of it is susuk they show like how the bomoh will masukkan the susuk then they will like oh it's sakit sikit tau so they masukkan
and then like if kalau kau histeria kan you can see the needles in your face
but then macam but they say like kalau the person who the person who masukkan
is the only person who can keluarkan
is it so if like ya unless unless if you go under the galah and then dia jatuh sendiri ah
it's either you cannot die or cause susah nak mati like the nazak right
but tetap can die lah so okay ah
because if you cannot die ah habis suffer like that
so tak mati ah oh take it out
the kafan and everything
ya but it's like you tangan semua
bodoh sejuk siol
dah lah tak tak pakai stokin
wait so they don't they don't bury you with kain batik kain batik is before kan
the funeral right oh chey ya so kiranya bila masuk kau keluarkan dari batik ah
nasi lemak oh tak ah no no no because kan
kalau kau dah keluarkan the
batik kan would you want to still use the batik
atau like the the the soil wouldn't stay right ya
err she said like ni orang-orang dulu kata ah macam if you are at the funeral kan jangan diri depan kaki mayat because in case kalau bukan-bukan kalau like the person pernah ada simpan barang kan they might pass it to you ya so don't like stand I don't know how true this is ah but
ya but I thought like kalau
so if like they ask you ya that's what I thought ah my mum you supposed to pass the thing bila dia masa hidup kan not bila dah mati
no as in the roof is what boleh buka oh okay okay okay
oh my god my mum like the interview she said like uh she would work right and then she would take leave then when her ask when her friends asked her like eh you took leave where you go the she said I won't go I'm gonna stay home and gosok baju and then aku macam ya she did I was like then what do you do for fun no lah I just stay home ah if my friends invite me maybe we go
like watch movie or what but after that I come back home I take leave so that I can wash everyone's clothes at home lah gosok baju semua because ya
ya and then like it's not like dua tiga orang tau like in the house there's like ten plus people I'm like why
last movie I watched I think I think aku tengok dengan anwar dengan irna
what is it ah I think was it house in the clock with the walls you know the one yang ada cate blanchett dengan uh jack black
aku selalu aku tak selalu tengok movie pe

ya cause it's it's macam really really dark
okay lah it's not bad lah I guess dia punya dia punya selection is quite
sikit lah

oh wait but I mean how old can how how old can the lembu be sia
in a situation where kampung is still
present you know and then like they need so many lembu
I mean like nobody care less somebody's lembu
oh kau film kat sana

ada ramai orang tinggal sana eh
then dia orang kerja apa seh
then waktu tu dah dah malam eh

singapore ada tempat apa lagi yang
hidden bukit I think

kalau kalau kau ada tiga wishes kau nak kau nak wish apa
how different it will be if we apa we never had COVID

then main dengan dia orang cute gila seh
macam nak bawa balik jer
cause I'm like more free right now so like ada lebih banyak masa untuk jumpa ah

you should just you should just go up there and then you just say kalau kau orang semua stop ah stop it
oh ya merepek gila sia
kalau itu kalau kawan aku yang aku confirm macam sedih sia
to bunuh
tak ingat seh I think like since COVID about
asal kau ketawa ah kau teringat something ah ni kan mesti
a'ah that time yang aku video call kau tu lah yang kau ingat tak what happen that time
tu ah
kerja aku rabak juga ah like because I don't know whether
um kerja aku recently buang orang like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left semua nak kena buat you know pick up the slack abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat
everything can be done via the laptop lah but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to apa tu collect dia punya physical mails
eh aku tak boleh imagine sia like I will I cannot even you know
both of us ada short attention span and like to have
abeh like you can't even like focus and
banyak orang juga like you know stress eat
I see I will check that out I think one day aku check it out
oh that's fun speaking of joget recently also like literal you know literally yesterday err me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through macam dance punya youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing kan kau you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to kau buat like um
HIIT workouts I mean that works better lah because you know it's a specific punya macam err they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then um she she we decided to because we have four I mean she we decided to apa tu download
this thing err this game apa just dance eh ya so we've had we've yet to try that err it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
like you feel more refreshed abeh nanti kau tak feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time err always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
I'm not one to preach but it is important lah cause now also zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang all fast food and things like that you know as compared to zaman dulu kan they're more much more
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes pun jadi ah
highly ambitious niat tu ada but selalu tak kesampaian like I set my alarm on at six in the morning everyday macam berangan ah like macam kau nak oh berangan nak jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour ah
and then lepas tu start the start my day right you know working and then like macam feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said ah tadi you just have to be consistent ah
kena monitor ah
ya like macam if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you macam tak nampak so tired or worn out tau
aku memang suka like dark err like because I don't know like
entah eh macam tak lawa sangat ah
ya I hang it like macam fairy lights around dia punya ni ah my my bedroom punya frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it lah and then macam because I prefer to use like macam candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that kalau fairy lights when you switch it on kan
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings ah different modes that you can choose from like macam those like blinking ones or like macam alah you know macam lampu lap lip lah basically
ya I use it is dia macam aurora lights
no lah I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep lah bila aku nak you know feeling spa day nak relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
bila aku nyanyi ya bila aku nyanyi nak feeling feeling
a'ah eh berapa lama eh kita dah kawan
kat gek poh ah
two yes tapi K one
K one yang dekat err mmhmm uh huh
sama eh
tak ingat seh but I know it's
memang confirm primary school lah but I don't know whether it's like primary five mother tongue eh ke apa
oh apa eleven
tak tahu it's like literally after school it's not
ah eh speaking of which tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun like literally random ah like aku tak rapat dengan dia pun like tu pun aku that time kerja part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then err kita tak contact pun and then after that random after few years aku jumpa dia dekat err tioman island ke apa then random gila then lepas tu we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we we plan a trip to bali and then I met her again just now so macam random lah like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to macam like meet them often but
oh ah tu pun random seh kau pun pergi trip dengan dia juga
anyway speaking of which how's your love life dah lama aku tak dengar apa any anything new that you want to talk to me about
the last time kau cakap dengan aku dia
something about his throat eh sakit ke apa
rajin seh kau
you know macam you gave so much um care and concern love to others
obviously you don't expect the same in return lah kau ikhlas memang but
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like macam it's one sided like you
you know then bila kau sakit tangan ni semua I mean it's not it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so macam he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like macam all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
err it is all about compromising and macam if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
then entah eh do you really think it's worth it then
a lot of things like macam
aww dia blue tick kau oh dia seen kau oh my god
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes dia yang paling decent
if you may never know mana tahu
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know um but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so kau just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me I know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head kan bila kau like you know
late at night kau tak boleh tidur thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually ah you don't like macam don't don't make it obligatory for him
kau tanya jer
and then kau action ah treat him for his birthday or what
bila birthday dia
oh dekat tu
tak ah kau action macam oh my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
ya or um no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like err jual mahal but at the same time like hey you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
err do you have any plans macam a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like macam err let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to err do you have any plans macam like secretly hoping him would to say yes
kau set reminder set reminder
dia sama age dengan kita eh oh
an hour we should like start a podcast or something lah it's like a good outlet you know like to to to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also lah dah lama kita tak jumpa kan and and it's like so good to to finally you know
you know kat belakang and not at the front so
love life aku boleh like you can literally write a book out of it man
my nonsense my lain my love life lain
same same thing same thing about my work tempat kerja err like my workplace
it's like err the shift timing and all is like change dah tukar semua so we like have to adapt lah ah then
around seven to four and then that's for the morning shift then the afternoon shift will start about four err four fifteen to one fifteen lah and now we change to four macam around
then apart from that also I think design macam like for social media ah poster ya uh macam gitu ah
so uh so cerita apa
you like what what you watch dekat netflix
ah I see uh I see ever since uh apa after COVID then I think like netflix release quite a lot of err nice nice err movie or series and
an italian cafe ah you know dekat bali lane eh ah bali lane ya
err macam sedap ah ya ya
better to macam reserve lah
watch a catch a movie ke apa ya really
like normal lah temperature taking and all then err you you have to be seated err macam just staggered sitting
you kind of have a extra privacy ah sort of ah that kind ya tu ah
I think kan macam
kalau orang itu err okay lah let's let's say macam nak buat plans kan
um macam my my friends wants to make a plan or plan out something and then lepas itu
we already like so into it already then then after that like suddenly last minute they want to cancel lah ini itu lah then ya that that kinds of err annoys me ah
ah suka advance planning tak suka macam last minute ah
ah macam my off days also you need to consider ah
tu ah then how about you
oh okay ya I I mean like it's true lah like macam you're not being yourself err not being true to yourself lah can say
certain things ah macam minor I don't know
like you know do do you still keep in contact with your like macam primary school friends ke secondary school friends like
who who is among your friends yang lama kenal ya still keep in touch
apa eh like they are not
then semua ada like ya like married and stuff ya so macam
my secondary school friend I still I still in contact and one of them is also like I'm I'm in a I'm in a band so ya so macam
macam like even now tengah tengah susah kan like some I think some of my friend also dah hilang kerja ah kena buang ah kena buang
so dia orang macam susah lah
kesian ah ya
so I heard kan you suka you like indo music right
so macam huh indo I can see from your face lah you look you look like the kind lah
macam gitu ah
ya yes yes especially tengah hujan ke apa so wah best mm
very err macam mana nak cakap
mm tapi tak lah macam teruk sangat macam
err heavy metal ke apa ke macam gitu no lah ya but
I also like macam kalau time macam hujan ke
macam time malam-malam I also like to listen to macam post rock you know like instrumental lah gitu ya
like very very dia macam macam
just playing err guitar for example guitar or piano ah macam gitu lah
then dia macam ah ah macam lena ah terlena ya
oh start up business takde lah takde lah apa apa business pun macam okay lah err
it's just a macam err small service lah can say macam kita kita buat err this err apa eh
macam you know is in indo I think it's stands for
like like ah let's say people macam request for something
in indonesia they they want it in singapore so we can request from there ah macam service gitu ah
like macam anything ah from snacks ke err makanan ke or err baju-baju
ah sebab I think kan pasal pandemic pasal COVID then kita dah tak boleh pergi indonesia ke nak pergi negeri mana-mana
I like suddenly macam struck an idea like to go and
err apa
like we can we can use this service or people can use this service untuk err apa
um bring bring food or bring apa-apa lah like snacks ke apa to singapore lah like they can macam some
macam ada orang dia orang rindu makanan-makanan indo then dia orang macam uh teringin ah nak makan
actually it's just three months aje lah ya we are still in our macam trial trial run lah kita tengah tengok macam mana err dia punya demand and people's punya response semua macam mana
and dia orang kalau happy
willing to venture out more lah macam venture in
ya like I think this is now macam a good opportunity untuk kita buat
such a business sebab
sebab kita kan
dah tak boleh travel
business I think mainly macam communication ah dengan ah like liaise
language barrier ada sikit ah pasal dia orang kan berbual bahasa so ada certain things kita tak faham then kadang miscommunication juga macam kita nak cakap satu benda dia orang interpret as something else
then uh tu tu one of the difficulties lah
then lepas tu macam err
sebab kita kan tak boleh ada there
then lepas tu
macam err we we
ah ah ya ya ya sekarang susah eh
ah we go sekarang mm that's why
like some now nowadays you nak beli groceries you pun macam susah I mean like you kena err cut down cost lah
kan selalu kalau tak boleh pergi ke apa just to buy our necessities then sekarang dah susah ah sebab barang-barang kat supermarket semua mahal seh then
hopefully lah inshallah ada mm
err first thing eh actually mm mungkin I want to go morocco
a'ah morocco one of the place then lepas tu satu lagi dekat new zealand
new zealand ya uh those two are depends not really dah lama but I think is err one of the beautiful places kan
but I I've I never I've never been to like err macam mana eh like those kind of err moroccan kind of err you know country ya yang macam ada those kind of architecture ya
so it's quite interesting lah untuk tengok semua ya
I suka macam tengok permandangan mm macam gunung-gunung
err macam gitu lah
ya sebab err
it's very beautiful lah kan like ya I I I've actually new zealand I've been to I dah pergi norway
ya uh uh uh so macam is is such a beautiful place lah
ya so then like like I think new zealand is also one of the one of it also so macam
that's why nak experience it lah
mmhmm macam very ya macam very chill and then lepas tu santai-santai ah
actually kalau macam new zealand kalau kita sewa macam caravan kan
I I think boleh consider lah parents macam err elderly ke orang-orang
yang susah macam kurang upaya ah macam gitu ah dia orang macam err okay ah they can just macam duduk dalam caravan tu
lepas tu relax
relax sahaja
so macam
I don't I think it's a it will be a good experience untuk orang-orang macam dia orang ah kan macam actually my parents pun dah berumur juga
my parents pun bukannya pergi
jauh-jauh sangat dia orang selalu pun paling jauh pun err indonesia
ah ah so indonesia punya view
indonesia punya view dia macam lain kan dengan new zealand new zealand macam ah then also dia punya climate pun
err lain ada sejuk sikit ya mm mm mm
mm correct macam I rasa
kita kan orang melayu kan so kita punya apa lidah or something eh our taste buds lah macam mesti kena ada pedas ah macam gitu or mesti ada
sambal ke apa ke err kalau macam bland ke macam let's say pergi western punya country macam makan pasta ke makan macam cream cream or cheese mm tak semua orang macam melayu suka kan macam ah sambal tumis lah ah apa
ya lah different perception macam orang pergi dengan parents mana pergi dengan
kawan pun macam mana kan ya so
ya if if for me maybe it's sebab sebab err
sebab apa kita macam err sometimes kalau okay lah like when we were young
you you don't have to fork out any cash ya you don't have to fork out money parents your parents will like buy for you or spend like so you don't have to worry about that lah but with friends ah you have to consider all of these things lah budgeting lah apa all that
like when that time I went to err europe ah then I experience the snow and all so it was err quite fun like you can have snowball fights semua ya then like you do all the silly silly things lah ya that we you don't get to experience in singapore kan
ya so but err how to say macam the aesthetic
uh I think jackets at least we can still save lah for our next few trips ke apa ya ya hopefully get to experience again
err oh ya okay dah pernah pergi lah ya I went before uh once ya
so I think you also went to korea right if I'm not wrong korea like huh korea and japan I think there are a lot of similarities but but the difference is I think in the terms of macam
orang dia you know macam like the the people there are really polite
polite gila like they
mm you should try the apa
err I'm not really but depends lah on the circumstances macam if you ask me to go skydiving err part of me would want but part of me will be scared lah of course ya cause like I'm that that afraid
ya I think I I don't I cannot I cannot even bunuh that spider because
ya so eventually I think we just let it be we just macam like throw things at it and slowly the spider went out of the house
tak lah tak ada lah ya ya ya ya this one I think can say quite
not not so hairy lah the normal tipis but but it looks it's like the size of my palm lah around there
cockroach dah mati bare hands tak boleh lah cockroach is quite dirty
macam kan
dia punya kulit tu macam keras then like I don't know I cannot tak boleh imagine macam mana orang makan
orh maybe when lepas dia orang dah kukus then dia jadi
lembut sikit lah is it

oo actually that's damn long eh I can't imagine like penat eh confirm
ah ada tempat duduk tak
before COVID oh my god it was a mess eh berapa banyak orang inside the bus
macam macam mana nak cakap eh like
susah nak breathe right yeah that's why I don't like wearing the mask you know it's really so hard
like satu tahun that is so long you know
yeah itu pasal ah nak buat apa right it's so sad seh like the amount of opportunities that we missed this year
kita tak tahu seh whether next year you can go or not
same oh my god last time I always go to makan sushi and the paling best right is like when malam malam kita go driving then we go and eat Ramly burger
but his burgers sedap gila oh my god actually like the authentic malaysian experience and I love it but like now
kasihan seh like
habis sekarang sebab COVID then they cannot do all these businesses you know like how they used to do and it's like so sad
huh tak best seh
dress up as a pocong to scare them
actually that's quite kelakar sia like honestly can you imagine malam malam tengah drive
habis tiba tiba nampak pocong scary wei I also will turn around seh LOL
yeah honestly but when in singapore tak ada apa apa jadi punya
like it's like okay kalau keluar terus kena ah arrested
habis like dia orang semua like they have fun with it ah but like I think I'm still grateful to be in singapore
no I don't need to go like all my lessons are all online and like seriously it's so fustrating I'm so penat
so it's like you always think that you have assignments due when actually you don't then like stress gila tahu honestly
it's like you would think that kalau belajar online lagi senang kan but no that's really not the truth it's really harder but the thing I'm grateful is like there isn't as many exams
but luckily for me tak it's like
our exam dulu kat um like hall besar besar kan sekarang it's all just in class
then honestly to me like tak ada vibes ah like there's no
and like honestly susah gila nak focus because like
ah tak my exam is all written
next sem we're going to have macam coding classes but this sem so far tak ada ah most of it is just like theory memorizing all so it's all on paper
eh but I thought they extended tak eh
best apa honestly I hated like
so it's always I feel like macam I'm the only person yang cannot focus at home but honestly I really can't you know but all my friends say like
oh it's so fun because no one disturb you or force you to do homework that kind of thing like it's very free and easy for them but like I tak rasa honestly
like for me like susah gila lah to focus at home like to juggle between like your life
ada satu tempat untuk belajar satu tempat untuk like stay home and relax you know then now is like very different
oh typical like mak melayu right honestly like they are all so naggy I think it's like
they are just born with it and I'm scared that bila kita jadi mak kita pun sama honestly I don't know
and I started using like photoshop of my laptop to like tulis notes and stuff
I did learn like a bit from this COVID nineteen situation bukan lah banyak sangat but
oh I only makan there like once before then I got try macam their chicken it's ironic cause I don't like chicken
but like their chicken is one the best but honestly I think a lot of people say that that's their best menu item right like the rendang
oh who did you makan ah malayan council with
oh man low key nak makan seh
like honestly but like you said mahal gila like I still remember the
memang normal lah cafes in singapore all the food mahal kan tapi like
yeah I always sesat at arab street honestly like
I can follow Google maps but I'm like honestly so bad at following directions so I always always sesat
more often so now I think I won't get sesat as much hopefully
I've been thinking of all these nice food to makan but guess what I can't makan cause I'm broke I can't find a job
same susah gila nak cari kerja serious like super fed up you know I'm like so fustrated
that kind of thing so like obviously semua orang apply apa kan
then bila apply then dia orang tak get back then macam tak faham seh like
I don't even know if I want to kerja at this kind of places cause honestly stress gila
like nanti ramai gila customers habis nanti got like fussy fussy people all but hopefully like
like dia orang macam sengaja right like they never like properly advertise their job scope
then only when you contact them then they will be like oh you have to do this nak kena buat itu lah nak kena buat ini lah
and I just don't understand like I've seen so many job postings like I also have that Telegram thing like apa satu
then like all ten never get back to me like serious tak faham seh
I don't know just make it easier for people to apply especially now macam COVID nineteen
time you think like senang meh cari kerja
yeah like honestly the tunggu like untuk tunggu like for them to get back to you that's like the worst part lah honestly
then like fikir fikir about it right it's like
you say a week right then any time in between that week pun you can call me you can like text me tell me I got the job
will end in a few months tapi tak
hais all this money that went to online shopping and now like yeah we can keluar but like barely pun
like I buy it for what I can't even like pakai to keluar and it's like so heart breaking
have this kind of spike and all then like when it terjadi macam terperanjat you know
we were like oh it's china's problem like kita semua ingat like oh china jer apa yang ada virus ni
like honestly I think in our heads we all thought that it would be like SARS because SARS was very contained in asia tapi tak seh
like tiba tiba ada berapa banyak cases
sekarang [dah] like how many one million two million kind of cases
like honestly banyak gila and if you look at the I'm so glad I don't live there because they are so like
and honestly like dia serious tak guna ah honestly he doesn't even do much for his country
and it's like now I see all these TikTok videos of like people who don't want to wear masks and like tak faham seh like
I understand wearing mask is susah lah but like you have to do it for the sake of your safety and other people also what right
yeah but if you think about it macam kasihan seh orang orang kat because like in the end
if you think about it all these old people who like they don't know much about the virus cause it's something like baru to them right
then maybe they will just dengar what he say because in the end he's president what he is the person who does everything and has the right of way
so it's like so kasihan
yeah exactly something that the president don't have and it's like so merepek sia you think about it it's like
it's like now I'm kind of having holidays because my exam only like on thursday lepas tu habis kan
ah kejap eh
so he like macam like got my attention ah then like wah he not bad sia honestly
but tak apa ah maybe this kind guy will be the exception kan
tuk tuk and like nenek will have these kind of names
super super tinggi but like one seven five not bad right
like okay lah I'm not like super upset about it ah tapi um macam sakit hati ah like because like
he just double tick me sedih tahu
I only made the account semalam so it's like what
banyak gila like malay guys who like match with me
daughters as in macam anak anak perempuan
it's like very personalized so macam you tahu macam he don't use it on other girls
I don't know the guy so far okay lah I think everyone macam
extra bosan now cause of like COVID nineteen
intense apa
like tak pernah dengar seh a dating app like this like OkCupid is so chill what it's like
habis lepas tu start talking but like Bumble is so intense what the heck
you got try before right the K Fry chicken sedap tak
ah seh honestly kita selalu pergi malaysia because like the prices are cheaper right especially with the
it's sedap gila like I don't even like dim sum
yeah like dulu kita kan selalu pergi malaysia like my family will go to like
makan like we are always eating you know
like you said there's not much to do in so it's always like makan makan makan
like kita
in one day I think we will makan at like what three different restaurants and three different places
like konon konon macam food tester ah try out like all the food in malaysia and
but like honestly like best gila seh that experience it's like
like you say everything that is not halal in singapore is halal in like malaysia
so it makes my life so much easier like you know every time I go like kena makan pepper lunch
I think it's like I saw your story then you saw my story kita dua kat kan then you like ask me where I going then like you said oh I going there also then I remember it was so funny
habis like tengok bawah
eh is that anna habis my whole family macam
siapa ah dia boleh like terserempak in cause we are singaporeans right
best apa imagine being able to go to an Apple store and like just woo spend all your money on the stuff honestly good life
I rindu seh like I used to love going weddings you know why
cause I want to makan nasi biryani
but yeah basically macam
so our weddings we'll make sure that we eat nasi biryani then we will make sure that it's the most
authentic nasi biryani cause you know sometimes people try to like put a twist on nasi briyani and all tapi tak
our weddings will always have like the nicest nasi biryani and honestly I just miss all that
he always does macam poll on Instagram and then got one time he tanya which is a must have for your wedding
then people didn't vote nasi biryani I was so sad you know I felt like it was a betrayer because
every wedding has to have nasi briyani like
when I think of wedding I think of nasi biryani right
yeah and another thing that I feel like kena ada is sambal goreng pengantin right
mm macam macam pelik also pe like hari raya is a holiday by itself you should enjoy it totally pe like why would you want your wedding in the middle
you know apparently got some people who purposely do their wedding during puasa so tak payah makan
but like how pelik is that like puasa is like meant for
puasa you know macam
mana orang nak pergi wedding mana orang nak pergi celebrate semua macam merepek kan honestly
exactly it's just weird honestly now thinking about it sekarang COVID
err wedding kena ada apa apa dua puluh orang jer kan
you know like honestly you know how malay families macam selalu kena ada wedding besar besar kan honestly I wouldn't mind
like I've always been telling myself I don't want a wedding yang besar besar because
okay you think about it you eh you're the pengantin right then like penat gila seh you must tukar outfit berapa banyak kali throughout the day
habis you kena salam salam semua orang kena senyum the whole day I don't want
macam my wedding to be full people yang my mum tahu you know cause it's my wedding pe shouldn't it be people yang I tahu not my mum
yeah I think yang paling penting is like the wedding it's like you do for yourself
yeah you did for yourself but then everyone remembers you as like the bride yang cantik yang berseri you know that kind of thing yeah honestly
yeah it's like a half half thing lah need to see whether my husband in the future kaya tak kidding
you know macam like err ada movie this one movie I forgot what the title is ah tapi macam
dia orang best friends dari kecil then they came up with their own book on how they want their wedding to look
habis like they in the end they ended up fighting then they weren't friends anymore
like honestly I forgot the name of the movie ah tapi the movie best gila
since dulu I've always wanted to do like a
I don't think being special is important but I think like just being unique not normal macam lagi best ah to me
I haven't thought of children's names yet but I'm pretty sure like that phase will happen soon cause I'm like so bosan now
yeah like in singapore macam susah gila nak like get all these things ah honestly cause
susah eh nak dapat all of it yeah so it's like
yeah I also think about it like err my dream die do right is to belajar in Australia
but actually like if you fikir about it lah actually it's better if you get into a like local uni because technically they are better
but I just feel like the experiences you gain bila like you go overseas and all is just very different you know
then like I don't know I also pun nak migrate but then if you think macam sayang right cause everyone is here then nanti raya macam mana raya will be
but I can't imagine now like sekarang jer [dah] susah for me to speak malay then imagine like when I have a child in the future
like you know dulu all my family members call me celup because they say like I always speak english even though I should be speaking malay that kind of thing
then when I got into higher malay in secondary school semua orang terperanjat macam huh
how did you even get into higher malay when you malay like berterabur
yeah actually it's true ah macam
we're not so good at malay right but we're not that kind yang want to totally forget about our language
like dulu like in malay class my cikgu always say like you want melayu to become obsolete is it
how all of you tak tahu cakap melayu semua then like I think about it like true seh like
how can a language just disappear macam sedih kan like you grew up with it and then like suddenly one day you see nobody speaking malay
so I will try my best to improve my malay sekarang I don't know
yeah honestly faham ah like hari raya is very like
honestly I feel like good looks is macam
genetic ah like kalau your parents
you macam
I rasa macam
good looks bukan benda yang you boleh work for but fit body is
dia tak boleh dapat any other way
I pun nak tanya
cause err I went I went to some I went to gardens by the bay kalau tak salah
because macam
I baru baru-baru ni I main apa tu
I I main kan then I noticed ah
you know then it's like especially now because everything is so macam
senang nak pergi nak nak fly back dari like singapore to like and all that stuff very interconnected so
I rasa macam
kalau kita orang err
kalau manusia were to be extinct right
then I rasa
most likely way would be dari viruses macam COVID lah that kind cause we are so
you never ever really hear about them pasal
tak ada banyak orang yang pergi africa
if we tapi kalau
going to africa to like visit ke apa
you might find like a lot more of these diseases more common in other places tapi like if you also see right
africa pun dia orang punya COVID cases not very high
so kita orang tak
tak prepared lah kira
I faham I faham
tu tu okay tu kalau
kalau population turun kan
the world gets better in a sense pasal
the the one problem that we're facing now is terlalu banyak orang tapi tak cukup err tak cukup resources macam you you said economics right that's the first thing that we learn too many wants not enough
so in a way unless like if yes our kita orang punya population turun
pasal like stuff like hunger and all that stuff
it will go down but it won't go extinct pasal there will come a point where
dah cukup like now we finally have enough
kalau you boleh err
kalau you boleh dapat tiga skill
yang err apa-apa skill lah you nak
apa skill yang mungkin you pilih
apa-apa lah
so kira like you you can you play soccer so kira maybe like you can dribble very well you can pass very well that kind
or if you want to like make it specific soccer to simplify also boleh lah
you punya
apa third one tadi
okay lah I feel like that yang yang the last one is
you you tak boleh manage stress you are done
in in my in my opinion lah like macam
because I run like competitively so I rasa macam ada orang yang
yang yang yang very
nak nak pergi dia orang suka competition macam gini and all that stuff
untuk I kan suka competition but at the same time I cannot help but feel nervous before competition like I like there are people who love the competition and they just it it comes naturally to them like performing well at competition they like that competitive part lah
if I have one skill it will to be to just enjoy enjoy that competition take that stress yes but understand that you dah kerja dah dah dah dah train dah work very hard for it
I feel like you can translate the endurance into almost anything and everything that you do because what comes with the endurance is not only macam
bukan physical jer tapi
also dari segi mental
boleh tolong ah pasal
I rasa kan
so kalau kira I tengah buat
err example lah during err exam during exam period kira kita orang stressed dari like buat maths mathematics ke apa
kita orang boleh pergi main bola ke boleh pergi lari and all that stuff ni benda yang I rasa orang lain tak faham ah
macam dia orang kira oh
main sports like during that exam period is like wasting time and all that but dia orang tak faham yang like for people like us people yang selalu buat sports and all that
cause macam you do math then you are like wah
wah tak boleh ah tak boleh I cannot solve this question then you very stress
then you will like wah then you even more stress you you feel even more like lebih teruk
jadi like
I macam
I can okay there are times when I can read situation betul betul tapi
and like most sometimes it can be bad lah like with around my friends is okay you know because they know how I am and all that tapi kalau let's say in a setting with like older people or all that stuff
you know so kira you you I'm not the kind that will mince my words when I see something wrong
so I rasa like that's one thing that I can work on lah and that's something that I should work on
apakah sesuatu yang you
you nak
apa yang you nak yang you wish that would be free
that will be free of like free I mean not just free of charge dari segi wang tapi juga macam you don't have to work for it
like it just comes macam gitu
okay lah then we keep it to benda physical lah like macam yang benda monetary ah monetary
free untuk
because in my opinion macam
and macam you will feel very purposeless
like macam sekarang
kawan-kawan kita orang semua macam bosan tak tahu yang tak kerja lah tak kerja tak like training macam kita orang
dia orang macam bosan tak tahu apa nak buat then like I have had
ada lah orang yang bilang saya macam dia orang feel very purposeless tak tahu apa nak buat pasal sekarang dah habis exam kan abeh dia orang
tak payah belajar and all that stuff
okay lah you can make money from it also but in a larger extent you can also help to eliminate problems macam world hunger and all that stuff you know
it will help not only myself but it would help orang lain
satu hari macam in the future that will be that will be not a superpower but that would be something that well have like like you get what I mean like in the future you will probably be there will probably be like a machine or like just something small that you just press and you can just go to wherever you want
ya just because he's dia dia masih dia masih manusia macam kita orang
dia the the relentlessness the drive that he has
is what makes him macam different
macam he will not stop until
that he that dia dia
dia deems as
um not good lah so basically whatever he does is really untuk kebaikan orang lain that kind and he will like do anything for his family
the the the common pasal I baca comics kan the common like theme throughout semua yang semua
dia very rarely dia make mistakes
because dia selalu fikirkan betul-betul
buat ah kerja dia betul-betul make sure make sure that like he gets it right
but there are times when dia pun
apa tu dia pun makes mistake lah because he's human what so
oh carrying on with that because you know how batman selalu macam
kadang-kadang in like comic kalau you baca
so going off on those labels that like you you can think of for batman right what are some labels that you rasa
can be good can be bad you you just say lah apa-apa lah
a label tapi macam
it is an idea yang macam
kira okay so
that that label that oh he's a he's a very good runner therefore he can do he can run like apa-apa jer you know
I don't know lah I I do like you I macam plays a lot of
because you got all these outside influence kira then you
you know you get what I mean kira
I mean you said that sometimes it can be bad that's true it can especially when you are kira unfit for your standard and all that then people mentioned like eh how come you today like a bit slow eh how come like you look like you put on a bit of weight
kira it can be good lah
given your current life kan like kerja cause kita orang baru habis err exam
tapi like if let's say like five six years from now
lepas lepas lepas uni bila dah start kerja ah
to be fair I also macam I I feel the same way as you
your dream job you want to be physiotherapist and you say kalau
people you nak kasih dia orang apa yang you tak you tak ada
I I pun nak macam gitu tapi I rasa macam the one job that I would enjoy the most would probably be training
so like being a coach cause sekarang like I I already sort of do that lah kadang-kadang like macam
I go back to school then like I help some of my I tolong coach I
to like err ajar budak-budak yang baru masuk macam gitu lah
then I rasa macam
it will probably be pagi
they especially kalau lari kan so like morning will probably be an easy run
tengah hari probably another coaching session but in between probably lunch break or something can slot in like a gym session then after that like the coaching session this coaching session probably like just coach a bit
and then not much running probably macam benda technical and all that stuff which I can also do lah in that sense which would be better because in a sense kalau you are doing the drill or you are you are training with the rest of the team or like with your with your trainees
that would be and then that is like probably in afternoon then at night probably another training session in and stuff like that lah this is of course like you said assuming yang tak ada orang lain dalam apa tu dalam err my life lah that kind

actually I don't get it is it taxes or what cause I heard is some hijrah fund or something I don't get it lah the
cause I watch one video they say it's actually like um people chipping in to go to mekah something like that some
some tabungan ah ya that's why that's why I was like wah you scam and most of it is older people that one like atuk-atuk nenek-nenek they like dying but want to go to mekah that type so they chip in to the tabung ah then I'm like bastard sia

hais itu lah
kedekut eh a'ah calculative sial
itu lah
dah lah kedekut bodoh pulak itu alamak
yay okay um oh my god can you imagine I cakap yay pula nanti dia kena transcribe lagi takpe takpe okay
oh how come ah how come boleh
but still two and a half months pass by quite cepat actually kan
oh cause macam
bila you start the project dah start is it the project that they were doing at the place
oh eh the area dekat dekat mana though
what was I going to ask oh but then macam was it susah to like
you know you you took on like new cases atau existing cases that they pass on to you gitu macam tak hard to adjust
macam short staff short staff sikit lah gitu
oh I think I remember your office dekat mana dia tempat uh my office dulu kan daerah situ
uh apa apa itu nak cakap mm
oh tapi padahal they
ya so macam your experience is good lah from the oh
and then macam environment besides environment wise macam your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all macam okay lah like okay like no issues
pasal dia dah biasa with what macam
tidak apa lah kita apa itu take turns
are there ada interns lain or you just seorang intern like or like got other people macam doing their practicum there also
I see okay okay wait the interns usually macam fresh grads or
all macam budak masters or like budak degree macam you know same level as you
oh so it's not macam it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
ketawa but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year atau
ya ya ya ya I mean I feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of macam
macam organisations lah
you know ada this issue
apa itu offer so called
it's okay keep your options open then macam explore um you know macam lain opportunities when do they need to hear by
uh okay tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam deadline for the application
ya faham faham totally faham
cause tadi bila I ketawa kan dia punya line macam besar
apa nak cakap mm
oh okay ya I totally understand macam the need to take a break I mean
studying kan lagi berapa lama before you finish the when you finish your masters
tak necessary is it
mm ah ya ya understand I feel like I'm there also I'm thinking macam you know I really don't mind
so macam who knows maybe if I if a a different place macam even a different job a different industry I could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree lah gitu
okay is macam zoom is surprisingly so much harder than tak zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like macam you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot macam how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so I must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like um when I
and then macam the way you talk to them actually on zoom kan you don't command as much like authority or respect I feel so macam the tone macam they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like I need you to stop
ya I mean right now they hardly recognize me also because I'm not their regular teacher and then macam I get a bit sub ah subconscious a bit conscious bila I punya camera on so macam when my camera itu on so I boleh nampak my own videos I'm like hate this makes me very macam self-conscious gitu lah
so tapi bila I off um I am less self-conscious I can be less
err I can be more strict gitu tapi I tend to not because kita have to senyum for the entire lesson senyum for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so macam
kalau macam camera off then I will terlupa to senyum gitu lah ya so a lot of things to take note macam
tapi dia orang macam type nonsense tau macam hi hi hi hi macam
kalau answer dia A they be like A A A A then I'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like ugh but then okay lah they are cute and I'm getting the hang of it I think tapi ah last week I did not teach because um oh so on thursday I injured my back
I went to the gym to the gym and then I injured my back and then bila I balik
no one week ago so ya so one week ago I tak warm up lah it was really stupid I forgot to warm up and then I just angkat berat then I felt like macam a sharp pain in my back then I was like oh no
so I thought I thought macam okay okay is it because I'm sore asal asal macam susah ini I feel like everything feels heavier and more I I feel like everything was sore I thought okay maybe
be sakit lah then macam I really messed up like aiya something is wrong lah this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back tapi I continue whatever I can but lepas I balik I had a class lah and then during the class I told them I will be lambat sikit because
I am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour macam this slow then I I drop my soap and I couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so macam so when I joined the class they were very understanding sorry I joined the class usually kita will jumpa about half an hour before the kids come in so I came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in lah so it's still okay
and then macam um I told them about it and then eventually I think after the class she told my um how to say my not my supervisor lah she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday tak payah so macam you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
jadi on saturday she told me uh tak payah kerja because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also I was supposed to go to the gym cause I had a training
tapi I tak pergi cause my back sakit so I was like okay lah okay lah
ya tapi
ya then after that I thought okay just rest lah macam take this opportunity to rest so I rest tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik and then macam it hurts when I sneeze so I thought alamak ini macam not macam bukan tak normal kan ya
ya so I told my coach semalam yang it hurts when I sneeze so she said mm she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so I started to panic and then she was like oh maybe you should go sebab kalau pergi the only thing a will do is give painkillers
so she was like I think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an or something so I was like tak nak so she was like okay lah then macam tengok chiro or like uh get a sports massage lah so I tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like bekam
and sports massage cause I read like bekam can help with like nerve macam you know what if your nerve macam err nerve pinching I feel like sometimes you macam you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so macam it's apparently bekam can help with that and macam
ya bekam can help you with that I takut sakit tak have you tried it before
oh did she say if tak sakit eh
mm you free kan dekat gambas that's where my other gym is
uh dekat sembawang there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east I think my the coach that um has is qualified to do like the massage and the bekam is dekat will be at the gambas one on monday
err she asked me if I can make it at two thirty then after that she belum reply I so I tak tahu belum confirm ah tapi
itu pasal she haven't reply so I said okay how long is the session and how much is it so macam
so no reply but I read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then macam what she will do depends on your condition so macam either I mean you can ask for her to bekam lah if you that's what you want macam mana otherwise she will uh base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a bekam or like some mobility work ah
mm tapi I think she buat bekam angin if I'm not wrong cause I think I saw a video of her doing bekam on instagram can send you
no it looks like the angin one like ada macam after she put the cup like she pull something mm then the thing macam suction
go for the darah one
oh so the dia macam slightly different how to say
err like bekam angin versus bekam darah macam target slightly different things lah gitu
oh the dekat rumah dia is it
oh I ada macam hundred around there standard right that's like standardish I guess
um like consultation dia sahaja dah
macam hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
uh tapi ya she she's a private doctor lah so very mahal like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation sahaja hundred plus then macam if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya so I'm thinking about I'm thinking massage atau bekam dulu lah I mean kalau it's not like
no ah abeh sekarang sekarang my kaki sakit dah lah belakang sakit kaki sakit because I pergi gym
for training yesterday kan then uh certain things aqilah lah like macam you know she
uh macam certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things I mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know macam I feel like my ego I have like macam like it's frustrating lah
like all the progress I've made gone so macam the the weight the weight the group that I was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and I was like thirty kilos
I was struggling because macam nak angkat sahaja sakit then the moment I felt like that stabbing pain I'll just like I scared lah so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya and then tapi semalam ada sekarang my kaki sakit because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so macam like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so macam
oh really ah tuesday I still have like um today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus I'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more sakit then I'll let you know
I mean it it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after bekam there's no like rule to not do any physical activity kan I mean kita jalan sahaja
so kalau kita I mean kita hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good I think for like you know aches and pains
oh my god my laughter is so cringe nanti orang transcribe
macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti all the haha hehes that kena transcribe I I cannot transcribe my own voice also lah can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
oh anyway apa itu so
have you seen the list uh list pula have you seen the website yang I hantar
I don't know eh macam the jinx tak lah
I mean mana-mana pun ada so it's me lah
ya but most of them are so far for you I think hillview is like the how to say dekat situ ada banyak trails I feel cause that's the nature reserve area
your areas ada ke other trails macritchie is it wait no sembawang area
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well I can't cycle and now I just announced it apa nak cakap eh okay we can look at more sites lah think got more options tapi yang yang at the the one I sent you to mm kita ada the lower pierce reservoir park
and then there's the sungei buloh wetland reserve need ini dekat mana eh kranji hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
oh this one got stairs don't want malas they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
oh tapi is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
she is married and I think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time ingat tak yang kita pergi makan
yang kita makan mukshidonna oh ya so she was talking about that
not officially tapi like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home I thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice lah he just seems macam very shy a bit macam shy lah I mean like a group of girls then kita kan kecoh so I think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
ya and very macam considering he's quite young he's very macam independentish macam financially independent like ya like matured lah matured
because err I assume her house I mean her house is big kan so I think and her room is big so I think macam he moved in with her lah
and padahal and I think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house tapi macam is easier pakai tudung leceh you know if you were like
I mean brother then okay lah I don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing tudung
ya ya ya I feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because macam how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes lah like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then macam if the wife is also like a
I don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya I get what you mean tapi macam less of an issue kalau if the guy moves into the house cause he
uh ya that's true I feel like macam there's that expectation lah double standards a bit ya
not working ya because like oh perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
especially macam your in your industry that you are working in like things change very fast
so macam if you come back after a few years then you're like uh you know some cause maternity leave is not enough like
just the maternity leave okay say it's like three months right around there is it not then after that four months okay then like is a four month old baby someone have to take care kan then it it might fall to the parents that's not fair so macam if you want to raise the kid until the age where the kid is like relatively
you know not independent independent but you know like of you know of the age where macam dah besar sikit then at least school age school going age you know
ha nampak
topic ni berat eh topic ni is very this topic is orang kata very wide dia punya spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance tapi beauty in terms of everything not just
uh look wise tapi beauty in uh nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is memang kita boleh counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
uh time kita berbual
so okay kita start gini lah eh kita start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay kau kau start dulu apa kau punya definition of beauty pada kau
oh that would tu bagus tu yes that that is bagus err bagus bagus
I don't see myself as kau tahu kan macam victoria's secret punya type punya ke lawa memang tak lah memang not even near that lah but because I I have my insecurities um based on appearance juga which itu pun is another topic eh kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu about me about
which people in our society is blinded by that sebab
standard kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
tapi for me beauty kalau kau lawa pun mana pun but if your if your attitude is macam gitu then
then memang you know what I mean
memang tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective ramai orang ada different punya perspective but we're we're not gonna touch on that but we can just uh it's between the both of us what is our definition
oh okay for me my kawan the friends that I go like the friends that I cari atau dapat it's okay we we can talk about poly ya kita punya poly days is kita tak I I don't see like oh kau lawa I'm gonna be friends with you no no no no I never sebab
kau lawa I was going to say you no no no no I never sebab
I mean I don't know for me memang I don't see
go towards that sebab it's not gonna be a genuine punya relationship you know
sebab it's just gonna be
for clout macam you know you know some people uh there there is some uh cliques ke apa whatever in school yang macam okay sebab kau lawa kau popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that that that popularity I'm gonna get that that fame dia ada attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is memang maybe not because during after kalau your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person yang macam will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
macam for me and you eh macam this is kita pun semalam baru jumpa eh we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like kita punya relationship first first kita start from sec one
and until now it last ramai of my other friends macam kita dah macam you know after that macam dah start to putik putus but with you and err err our friends yesterday it is a long lasting macam kita tak awkward tau and that that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever inshaallah
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know kita punya chemistry kita punya behaviour
kita punya personality because okay imagine kalau the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine kita takde macam makan orang makan orang you know what I mean like like betray or
tak payah cari beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any betul tak tu
like fashion wise you know is it oh damn okay I think I get what you mean my my course pun ada juga yang those type of cliques that
uh handsome uh lelaki kat dalam my course yang baik yang humble yang tahu yang dia orang tak stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also um
uh girls that they they dia orang punya dia orang macam you know they have that that beauty standard lah dia orang ada that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are sombong they are arrogant you know
so so macam it's a
I don't know err macam for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say kalau kau lawa you should then uh take advantage of it like you know you should your personality pun kena bagus
sebab but but people people who are lawa usually you know you know dia orang dia orang I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna ada that ego you know that ego that that it depends lah how you are brought up you know
not just that lah beauty in terms of you know right uh now we are all going to that stage of working kan it's always kalau it's always macam you see this um
not just competition but macam okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that macam sebab this person is sexy ke apa ada landed job
I mean that is for us yang mungkin macam of a lower standard
betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur eh I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
tapi uh beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that uh
this we can say about our macam okay in the future kalau you nak cari um
is beauty important macam appearance wise or the best is macam mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
ya tu memang tu memang tu memang
ada yang suka cute cute ada yang suka macam E-boy E-boy
uh no err not not not the first uh judgement because because first judgement memang is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but uh overall macam to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
okay kau okay kau kau share kau share dulu cause ni pun uh is an interesting fact
true true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty sebab okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is is nothing macam okay lah first judgement yes appearance tapi kan people say kindness is beautiful to me intelligence is beautiful to me or macam
uh macam the the act of uh sharing macam
uh caring the your you punya personality that is beautiful so
macam I think beauty eh is is
is again subjective sebab
ada orang eh they say macam asalkan kau kemas kan macam kau err you are clean you clean yourself macam it macam bukanlah you I'm asking you macam pergi plastic surgery to be beautiful no no I think I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
but but overall macam the of how you take care of yourself macam for the macam kita how we how we like its like macam you know like we we kita basuh muka something like that you know
the sense of beauty sebab okay macam beauty eh is again macam very it can be very um
nak trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know uh I I got this macam macam experience kalau we we talk with our friends ke apa we always like ada juga topic topic yang macam ini maknanya macam anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of uh people
uh again it's it's about um macam low self esteem you know kau ada face gitu tak aku ada I I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities insecurities that macam to me I find that
macam kau do do you have any like um
insecurities ataupun macam low self esteem towards this kind of uh topic
I pun sama
sama sama sama sama for me sama err like I think
susah eh macam
unless kita kes yang macam our confidence level is very high ya but of course
terdetik lah kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang very kita rasa macam eh alamak you know what I mean
I I came across this one uh uh apa tu uh it's a meme lah the it's a kid the kid says macam the kid was saying uh dia like macam to god tau god uh
okay but I think betul lah macam
for me pun times yang I I I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful lah you know which is a wrong mindset sebab that means eh
if I'm uh pretty I will get somewhere I would get uh at least a modelling job ke apa you know at least I have something tapi
tapi okay siapa tak nak lawa kan siapa tak nak handsome buat apa dalam dunia ni
um tadi nak tanya tanya seribu question boleh
I think kan for me okay kita kita perempuan kan but I I think um generally generally speaking kan I think it's the girls is it but not me lah
subjective subjective but but I think kan it's more towards the girls sebab kan kau tahu lah macam we have like boys and girls is different what kita punya how we hangout how we
pergi towards that that
that apa tu tujuan like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
to you apa to you which one for you
ya ya ya macam in terms of gossiping also lah you can say that dia orang macam more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which macam for for girls maybe some of them will talk about eh look at that I mean eh macam eh have you heard this about I heard about macam some of my friends uh classmate dia macam eh kau tengok tu eh kau tengok dia ni eh kau tengok you know they we they are always macam
that's kind of the topic yang
for you know me and you kita tak kita we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
kaum wanita lah it's always kaum wanita
tapi ya ya but uh uh um to mention macam orang yang tak lawa
tak but it's kini it's how society pandang you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know sebab this is how society looks sebab to be honest who started this thing called macam
uh okay uh kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this uh or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing mesti ada dulu maybe in history ada jer yang macam
okay kalau you macam ni I you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with um you can say ni lumrah manusia tau you know kau tahu benda ni macam this human standard the world doesn't do this tau it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually kalau kalau we all treat people the equally uh got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having uh insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem sebab it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
macam okay I'm not gonna I'm not sebab you get it's subjective it depends some ada some parts of the world takde macam gini but some parts some of the world
that is very macam sebab it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning what that's why ramai orang macam ada yang every article is that people suicide you know
tak payah cakap pasal you macam gini kan it it can be because maybe sebab uh you are having this disabilities which I I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they they never do anything to you what betul what macam
dia orang tak kacau kau apa or like they judge you base on your uh clothing ke based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can uh about also about also macam status
hierarchy system macam kaya and poor
is is tak berapa bagus
not just beauty tau macam pasal poor and rich pun boleh jadi problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen uh kau tahu kan macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak kan macam budak budak ada yang kena outcast kan you know what I mean
that macam uh the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that uh after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit macam betul lah like
takkan semua sama right pekerja then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work what because
true true true so memang ini
lumrah lah eh memang memang it's the world lah it's just it evolve like this lah to be honest mesti there is there is gonna be uh plus minus there plus minus macam you know macam kau tahu okay uh dunia hiburan
about okay uh western world atau K pop eh macam for example that kind of thing
usually yang lawa jer pun yang disanjung disanjung disanjung
eh actually no actually no I think it just it just involve in the korean punya
the K pop world you know what I mean sebab in western world we don't look at beauty what we we we judge based on uh music wise kalau kita suka kita suka macam for example like
uh there are uh idols macam mana eh
macam okay uh like
tak I think macam it's different kita tak boleh compare we cannot compare like western punya industry like the hollywood and and also K pop sebab K pop I I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol atau the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
yang lain semua you know especially when you're in a group of uh like of kau pernah kau pernah uh come across this article tak dia macam there's this one idol dia punya member tak berapa lawa tau macam
to me it's fine lah but it's ada sikit macam different daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa then all the all the macam the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is tak tak not of a pretty tapi is in the middle
so I think that is also rabak lah to be honest
ah memilih kasih padahal sama group tau padahal they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead lah like like why sanjung uh idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people sebab ada jer yang news turns out that oh this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu the fans doesn't uh
yes you said it betul apa
macam you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish tapi okay but see this is how beauty
beauty eh macam
uh sexiness ke based on their face ke or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards uh bad punya
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as uh the macam those those fans yang sanjung sangat kan it's not uh it's not it's not a good habit for them what sebab
sebab right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like macam harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
macam kau tak payah ada beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
tengok jer macam um oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the lawa the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that uh hosting punya and she can be successful you know what I mean
yang benda uh success
it also goes with macam top uh fashion wise you know what I mean
macam kau tahu kan dulu uh okay zaman sekarang right you know if you were to just wear like uh sloppy
macam T-shirt and cause that's what I I do sometimes you know but and then kita pergi kedai mamak something like that right
kedai uh kopitiam or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think macam they they will look at us like eh dia ni biar betul you know what I mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where kita kita I'm gonna feel macam
tapi get it it's it's how era goes you know sebab zaman dulu imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right dulu time maybe like early two thousand
a dress with heels to a kopitiam people will look at you macam eh you biar betul
lain macam but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
uh think macam oh kau lawa macam it's fine
so see how this uh the the era macam how uh move eh you know what I mean
lain eh which is weird eh macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir wah
as technology becomes more macam
orang kata apa lagi gempak then
jap eh
tak tahu no no no no no I'm not talking about you as in macam those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters dia orang nak step jer macam they just follow the trend you know what I mean
I think there is like macam photos trend I guess kita kita use simpler uh simpler terms eh
as you know macam around starting to see because here I feel it
you know what I mean sekarang uh is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is uh macam instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
uh this kind of thing uh macam pinterest uh
dulu tumblr okay tiktok sekarang tiktok kan
sekarang tiktok where
the you you I mean you we see everyone's punya life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols ke your punya favourite punya artist uh kim K ke whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
you know what I mean so maknanya
due to that that's why uh people are like following macam okay macam E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl tapi you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
tapi to me I think
you can you can follow whatever you want tapi kalau you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing err you know what I mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like suka dia punya style macam some people you can we see oh I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means tapi you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya macam that is that is not the right way sebab macam kau kena genuine with yourself lah macam
imagine you are not like that right tapi sebab kau nampak uh your maybe your cliques are all macam
uh going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you if you uh if you just change your clothing then it's fine tapi you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing kalau if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good uh circle of friends that is a good company tapi if you start to macam okay maaf cakap eh this can be very sensitive sebab imagine if your circle of friends uh macam smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right tapi you buat
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't uh people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right macam you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in macam
with people macam mana eh I I say you don't need to get okay macam mana kau nak get this thing
so macam you know like um you know they say there's a saying macam uh everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like macam macam mana eh like
err macam the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset tapi you you don't
but because everyone's macam kau
needs a level up you know what I mean macam level of for the good
tak bagus lah tapi macam like see this is how uh trend setting macam
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it tapi if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later tapi if you follow that kind of group yang buat benda tak elok then uh then you should
you should have your own pride eh macam you know what I mean kau punya pride kau tak payah follow orang lain punya orang lain punya instruction ada betul
boleh boleh boleh shoot jer shoot
pandang rendah is it pandang rendah you look down on them oh
where you stand macam mana you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group macam tadi kau cakap
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead macam if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your macam it will lead you to a success atau macam lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead sebab if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead tapi kalau you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's sebab you nak ada you nak ada friends you know what I mean like quotation macam you nak ada friends punya pasal then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good uh there is not a good tujuan sebab kalau kau really nak
I mean you know some people macam for me no eh macam for me I got this thing where
kalau aku takde kawan then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I I mean you know there are some people
kita nampak I've I've I've seen this
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they dia keluar from the group kan dia keluar from the clique and then dia cari orang lain immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much macam you like like tak bagus lah I I rather be alone you know what I mean I I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own uh pendirian daripada
I I think uh I need to find I need to find a friend because uh because people might think nanti macam I got problem
same goes like your question tadi whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so sebab if the loner if that loner sometimes loner tu feels that
there's nothing wrong uh he he or she is of a good uh direction even if the person is alone go ahead I I kita support aku support tapi kalau
sebab you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on oh kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish lah I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know macam they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
sebab if you want to go for me eh aku aku I like to keep my circle of friends close macam just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know sebab to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial macam mana eh
you know kawan kosong and kawan that is really true
ya so back to your question where kalau the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but kalau you it's hard it's hard to say macam for me you know I just say but if I were to
tapi what I I can advice macam
tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
macam you you know kita aku case macam the clown eh macam the class clown and then and then when I okay okay for the kita ni ni macam podcast eh tapi macam okay for those who tak tahu
aku I'm I'm okay I won't say that I'm I'm ambivert macam I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met mahirah kan macam okay dia macam pendiam tau but actually she's not you have to get to know her to know her
tapi uh mahirah aku
ya it take a long time not years lah tapi but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a it's a connection
but no aku respect kau sebab okay you you call yourself introvert right
but you are successful kau
for those who tak tahu
kau chairperson seh kau your leadership skill is really aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik err sebab your leadership is the best
and those who don't know don't know tapi once you find good people right you you stick to them macam for me thank you for being
my friends chey macam sedih pulak jiwang kenapa pulak sebab sebab it's true it's true
ya around sec two is where we kita more like kita dah kenal sec one but sec two is the year where
kita macam eh dia ni dah gila dia ni dah gila
kita punya gila-gila dah start kita punya gila-gila kita punya hantu hantu setan dah start eh dah start eh ya that's that's tapi wow those are the great days no those were the days where kita don't give a shit about appearance wise you know what I mean
kita kalau like eh how beauty what ever no kita macam kalau kau baik kau
kawan macam kau boleh gang dengan kita go ahead like come advice kita takde macam
seek uh clique clique mana ada kita open seh open macam ni
whoever nak join join asalkan kau uh you have that
you I mean uh sometimes you are good you know I mean kau kau orang baik tak payah macam pandai ke apa tak payah tak we don't we don't we don't do that
no kita tak kita tak
ya and now that we are matured right kita punya topic pun makin mature eh
friend pun kita dah macam we we we talk about mature stuff now and also confirm kita ada joke around but
we we kita takde mahu kita we we don't like really like judge people I think
tapi that's that's the that's the good thing about our
yes aku aku respect beauty those people who I find really pretty right aku macam aku macam respects seh like you know what I mean like like macam celebrities I would like wah
like wow you know what I mean macam uh models yang macam handsome pun aku macam wow you know like
aku aku take that as a role model you know like wow that that is
macam wow lah you know what I mean
there are some macam kau tahu you know mira filzah tak
dia punya beauty kan
and her personality oh my god dia full package you know she got the personality she got the great voice dia punya voice kan lemah lembut kan and then dia pun lawa dia dia okay
dia tak lawa lawa tau
but her lawa is very sweet type you know what I mean macam kau like sedap mata memandang you know what I mean macam you you you can just like look macam
that kind of beauty aku macam respect sia aku aku aku tabik
wah that is good that is the best kalau you've you got the full package you know that you are beauty and then you are humble about it wah
kalau kalau western pun kau kau handsome tak western kalau western hollywood style
kalau aku siapa eh
okay we we okay we we don't know like their personality how lah but but there we but we appreciate their dia orang punya beauty
yes we appreciate kita tak macam
jealous or judge you know like eh rambut kau lawa tak tak eh no no uh when when we judge is because kau punya character
like like you you are you you you are pretty but then you are like very snobbish or like you are very arrogant and that that is when we like macam alamak come on lah you waste you waste your beauty
why waste your beauty but you know some people don't know that macam
like macam you know what I mean it's it's how you are brought up juga lah how does everyone
she's beautiful to me and her character macam yang macam motherly kind of uh you know what I mean of how she brings me out aku
of a role model like wow like like macam
macam kita kita we wanna be someone like that you know what I mean
we wanna be someone like that that's that's what I see macam
and and how dia macam ajar like even when she come back work she still like teach my younger siblings
macam ajar then wah
um tak payah cakap pasal beauty lah it's macam dia punya attitude wise you know what I mean
the is that tapi kalau macam if you want to say like like western punya or like macam barat
uh pelakon ke apa kan then I would say neelofa
is the ya malaysian punya actress host uh business woman sebab kan uh kalau kau tak tahu kan dia buat this brand apa yang neelofa punya tudung and then she's she's she's successful sampai pergi uh
milan uh to the the business berkembang
she is a great uh host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something dia masih belum berpunya she's still single but her driven of uh being that success both dunia and akhirat aku boleh cakap
it's it's like wah macam
it's something that macam you god bless you you know
uh role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and uh of a islam uh muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing apa tadi kau nak cakap
betul betul betul the I mean the the the life the hereafter lah
ya tu oh my god singapore living ya
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is wow I think memang it's very rare no not just both tapi your character pun baik your personality pun baik
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost macam
role model lah I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man yang macam you know that you have okay for the guys handsome uh bekerjaya and um uh apa we can cakap apa faithful is it faithful and then um of a good personality then
memang susah nak cari but these are the people yang macam you risau tapi again to those yang kita okay kita boleh uh rumuskan eh sebab we got like a few more minutes tapi um what I can say is that we shouldn't just um we shouldn't just
uh okay what's that word eh I want to say that this kau tahu kan macam kita kita jangan just tengok yang lawa kita just tengok yang handsome you know what I mean we we don't we don't err okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance sebab
it will just make you rasa diri you yang kalau you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we atau whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down what like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this macam successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself kalau just you know what I mean like
betul you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of uh just be humble be kind I think kalau at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character betul tak
so just ya just be on that don't worry kalau
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly macam choose to that but slowly slowly I think I think as long as you macam you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know bila
so then you just be humble lah macam
you know what I mean macam we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then baru kita move on to ten years down the road what should we
macam it it it has come to a point where
macam because of beauty lah because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I I think myself ni macam takde value
and it has come to a point where macam whatever people take one for me aku macam mengalah aku like okay give in give in give in cause I felt like
to have like prioritise in me sebab I I tend to like
to like macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang seh
you know what I mean so it has I should be more macam have that confidence which I I aku tu tu last time eh tu last but right now I have I work on that and it's it's I find that
so to the next ya uh future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road apa kau punya advice
true true that is that is important and macam to just have that little selfishness in you so that
ni is important betul okay
ellen punya ellen put aside eh tapi tapi
betul this is my pendirian I know where
higher status kau manager your kau they treat me they treat us macam kita ni beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what I mean so I aku macam to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day aku
treating people nice is you is a must sebab how can you judge sebab I got people around me macam they they judge okay for example
kalau kau punya job uh macam uh cleaning wise ke apa kan
kau why would you uh I've seen this this is another topic err like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern eh I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because uh kita they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like uh kuli we are like beginner
kita macam baru masuk industry then they they they bully us they they not just uh okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment tapi if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like macam kita sampah or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists I I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like oh my god you you you you forget where you where you start you kau kau dah lupa diri kan this is what happen when kita lupa diri so I I I just want to advice myself that oh my god please
nadia don't ever lupa diri sebab one day kalau I get that extra money ke I get that extra title ke I might forget about myself and people below me
because I myself experienced it how bad it is and I know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future I advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know bila this uh blessing will be taken away from you you know what I mean that's uh

ke rumah dia naik atas ah
javani ah tapi then like
dia nanti kadang kadang berbual pasal gini ah
dia kata breakfast lunch dinner semua is all social construct kan ah ah
there's only one in a few times ah tapi banyak kali macam
nanti kalau berbual dengan dia kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk dengan dia so macam kadang kadang aku macam just borak dengan dia macam biasa kan tapi kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk
abeh dia nya intellectual memang bagus ah macam entah budak budak soci semua gitu eh
ah macam fikir ah gitu macam dia macam that time pun kita discuss pasal
in macam different races in singapore ke tak payah macam gitu ah
ah habis kita cakap all the pointers macam actually tak payah semua
aku rasa kita kena ah
entah aku rasa tak tahu cause macam
okay maybe in the future then tak payah aku rasa in the future macam sekarang still kena ah cause
no ah macam sekarang terlalu awal macam I mean right now technically kau nampak orang kau dah tahu dia india melayu atau cina kan
in the future pasal aku rasa there will be like a lot of cross cultural nya marriage ah mixed
sampai kan dah terlalu banyak mix then dah susah
nak categorise so in the future baru macam tak payah categorise ah
ye lah ye lah
tapi macam
okay abeh kalau macam kau dah mix like
dalam kau ada lapan bangsa macam mana
ye lah kau macam macam one quarter ni one quarter tu one eighth
let's say let's say macam okay if your dad is like half malay half chinese then mak kau is like half indian half eurasian
ah bila dapat anak macam mana
alien eh tak
macam mana seh tu
then ah kalau race ikut bapa jer kan macam
it's not it's not accurate kan pada kau accurate ke aku rasa tak ah
and pada aku you shouldn't like ah
macam pelik seh I mean race is something like you're born with so kau tak boleh choose seh
construct ah ye lah
oh tak maksud aku
ye lah okay it's not fair cause macam
cause then mak dia punya side macam mana like
kira kan it's unfair for macam mak dia punya side ah
macam kalau the race just ikut bapa dia
let's say kalau race ikut bapa dia dia tak macam melayu tapi dia bukan melayu pe actually dia mix still mix what
then lagi satu apa tadi yang second nya
aku just rasa pelik tau macam you're born and then macam kau choose your race and then some people choose cause of nak dapat benefits ke apa ah tu dah macam
kau boleh choose to
ah betul lah tapi that time aku dengar macam kalau kau cina
err okay kalau kau melayu kan kau bila jual rumah
kalau boleh jual rumah to melayu atau india tak boleh jual to cina
ah potential punya customers sikit and then
and then cause of that kan the value of your house will drop kira kau sell at a lower price ah
tak lah tak lah ada satu word
as in oh okay okay okay boleh lah
yishun orang gila semua kat sana
kan actually betul pe tak eh yishun besar so
betul juga ah tapi ya lah like
kalau dorang buat a quota for private housing then
tak ramai seh melayu dengan india beli kan
kesian seh yang melayu kat situ
kau dah besar kau nak beli rumah apa
okay kalau kalau kau ada duit untuk beli condo will you buy a condo and will you stay in the condo
kira ambitious eh kau
macam sorang ah
oh macam macam gini eh oh okay okay okay okay
tak ada tak ada eh wait ada ada ah aku pernah hantar makan
kat those rumah
macam gini juga ah tapi mahal dia tapi mahal
ya mm pasal ada balcony okay dia dua tingkat dia tapi dua tingkat
ah all the units semua ada dua tingkat
sort of ah dia dia macam ah dua tingkat kan tapi atas is studio apartment
then kat bawah is like the living room and the bedroom ah so it's like macam
mm kira kau boleh overlooked the first floor kan ah cause
aku rasa government buat gitu pasal they want to encourage ah encourage families macam to live with their parents
so if studio apartment kat atas macam parents nya bedroom dengan
ada ada satu ah apa lagi satu pintu kat atas there's two gate satu pintu
ah then connected by tangga ah
aku ada ni ah aku ada sedara yang tinggal kat sana
tak ah
not nice ah dia nya studio apartment atas kecil gila
ya studio ah tapi not nice ah and then like macam pasal makcik pakcik aku da tua kan so like sometimes the whole day dorang kat atas jer tak turun bawah pun
cause everything is ah malas macam kaki pun sakit pe so tak boleh turun bawah
ya pasal dorang ada dapur kecil juga kat atas
ah then dorang nya living ah living room rak kecil and then bedroom dah
oh back to the question so kira kau nak beli condo ah
kira kau nak beli condo ah bila kau dah besar
ah seh aku pun
ya kalau ada macam gitu I I nak
I don't know ah I I mean aku macam tak nak beli private housing
for investment purpose okay ah tapi untuk tinggal tak ah
um aku nak aku punya kids macam
main kat playground lari lari
tak tapi aku nak more macam
not just playground kira dorang nak main bawah blok okay aku kasi dia main bawah blok lepastu dorang main dengan budak budak
ah at those area kan dorang punya kawan ah dorang main main
ah then ah gitu ah abeh
tinggal pun everything is dekat macam private property jauh sia serious serious ada yang macam jauh abeh like very secluded aku tak suka ah actually honestly aku prefer macam
kalau dia punya neighbourhood macam bising sikit
macam so kira macam best ah kecoh macam happening ah ya
ah bising tapi in a good way nya bising ah macam
budak budak semua main semua ah not bising
matrep naik motor perah motor lepak ah not that type of macam tempat ah
ya so kalau aku ada duit pun aku maybe tak akan beli private property ah
tak boleh ah aku just tak boleh ah macam

okay babe I ada soalan I nak tanya you kalau COVID nineteen benda ni semua dah selesai
kita tak perlu susah payah nak quarantine ke nak stay home notice ke nak risau tentang leave kita cukup ke tidak you rasanya you nak pergi mana holiday kalau boleh
bulan bulan march err tahun ni ke atau tahun
oh tahun ni
oh okay tapi you dah beli air ticket ke belum
AirAsia ke Singapore Airlines
oh okay tapi kalau depa dah refund sepatutnya okay lah
I ada dengar juga kawan I cakap AirAsia tak boleh refund langsung atau partial refund atau
you know maybe they will just macam postpone lah their trip sampai tak tahu lah bila
tapi kalau okay japan ni you pernah pergi ke tidak atau ni kali pertama
mm dah lima kali okay
so then tapi okinawa is first time atau bukan
ya so I rasa macam kalau boleh kan quarantine ni dah selesai tak perlu susah payah macam ni sangkut dalam rumah
I nak pergi jumpa boyfriend I sebab
kan kita ni memang long distance relationship dah kan tapi lapan bulan dah tak jumpa
kalau boleh I nak gi perth lah sebab I rasa macam
perth ni bila I gi kat situ um
selalunya rasa macam very peaceful
kacau I
so I can like eat and sleep and relax or maybe because I'm on leave juga lah
so tak rasa macam stressed sangat
oh betul ke tapi australia you pernah pergi ke tak
okay boleh juga ajak you lah ah okay lah
so ya so I pernah pergi ke sydney sekali
melbourne sekali yang dua-dua kali dengan mum I lah dengan my mak
sekali dengan mak I juga and then I've been to perth I think this time dah kira the third time lah
next year kalau boleh I nak gi lah tapi
because sekarang
kan australia punya borders err rasa rasanya dalam Berita Harian  dah tertulis
they tutup sampai
tahun twenty twenty one
oh betul ke and you tak pernah visit
you should you should so then macam mana dengan
person that suka holiday suka keluar err
for new adventure tengok new adventure see new things so during
err tahun ni kan semasa lockdown uh semasa COVID you ada rasa macam you
you suffocating a bit ke tak like you know um like you cannot go on holiday you ada rasa macam mana
during circuit breaker at that time I was renting my room dengan ni house mates I
and at that time there was like five of us in the house so tak rasa macam lonely sangat lah
because sebelum ni kan
you memang tahu I tak tahu
memasak langsung so I didn't know how to cook um nasi pun tak tahu lor so then it's like
susah sikit lah
then I had to macam ask
I was very lucky that during the lockdown I tinggal dengan mereka lah at that time ah
boleh boleh makan lah but then there was this one time bila I masak uh kari ikan
salmon salmon I okay boleh makan tapi curry dia I think sebab I added too much water
so rasa dia macam air instead of or is rasa dia macam salmon soup instead of salmon curry lah
hais you tahu tak hari tu because I'm thinking to myself
that you ni kan memang drive and I take public transportation
so I was thinking hari tu kan you know outside rumah I ni I was sleeping very soundly by myself and you know just
dia accident
betapa kuatnya I heard bang
and I was like apa jadi ah
look out the window but then tak nampak apa apa then kawan I ternampak
memang yang accident tu teruk lah dengan motosikal
then kereta depan dia memang hempas sampai the whole thing is spoilt lah
kemek already crash already lah
ya so then after that few minutes later you can terdengar lah ambulance tu
ah betul
mm betul tapi you pernah kena accident tak
so far pernah
okay pas tu
wah kereta dia terbakar
I rasa macam I ada nampak
video tu kan I think ya no bukan nampak kereta dia kat tampines tapi I think I rasa I nampak video dia kat TikTok
sebab biasanya usually kalau ada accident kat singapore ke apa apa yang terjadi dia akan upload dalam TikTok
so macam tu lah so talking about the news um do you follow tak the the punya politician semua
mm I nampak tapi I macam tak faham
faham lah
sepatutnya I nak pergi shopping tapi I rasa macam hais
you know kena save money lah
and then you know uh tapi I rasa macam the houses here pun sekarang
getting more expensive and kalau tak I kena you know buy like somewhere further away from the city and it's not convenient sebab I tak pandu kereta kan
so macam tu lah eh you ada siblings ke tak
oh I tak tahu pun you ada siblings
okay so your big brother buat apa
tak ada lah I ni kan only child
so that's why that's why like you know my parents I kena take care of them lah
so that's why during this COVID nineteen time I worried sikit lah sebab kan they are walking around in singapore
I takut lah kalau ada apa apa yang jadi especially bila that time when the domestic workers the numbers were increasing and
you tahu lah parents ni tua-tua yang semua tua-tua ni kan
bila kita bagi tahu jangan keluar dari rumah sebab sekarang ni kan COVID dangerous especially if you are high risk
risiko tinggi kan jangan lah keluar sebab
macam diabetes high cholesterol
err like macam mak I she's had a stroke before it's it's dangerous lah to to bahaya lah to go out
things in public kan and taking the public transport and dia ambil juga
so that's why memang tak nak dengar lah so susah sikit lah so like I was very worried for my parents but then it looks like
the numbers here in singapore is dwindling is is sudah semakin kurang
so nampaknya macam okay we're getting better
but then you tahu tak what is the difference between phase three dengan phase two sebab I tak tahu
yang tu jer
tapi I rasa macam activity tu not so important actually the ones that is more important to me is the travelling part lah
ah betul juga
but then like travel bubble kalau you boleh cadangkan travel bubble you rasa travel bubble dengan siapa
you get to pick five countries yang mana lima country yang you rasa you nak
you nak travel bubble dengan
tapi philippines dengan indonesia I would be very afraid
because philippines is uh dengan indonesia
ya because the two of them sekarang ni memang tengah competing and then philippines competing to be the winner
so rasa macam I don't I would not feel safe kalau we have travel bubble dengan mereka
ah new zealand new zealand is good ya memang cantik and I heard the prime minister is very good also mm
so ya I heard she has been doing her very well with the number of the COVID nineteen cases lah di di negara dia kan
so macam tu lah so biasanya you ada baca news kan Channel News Asia
yang macam mana yang ada apa like
apa rapist siapa
dalam Channel News Asia they reported that oh my god that is so sad kan
esok uh kerja lah apa lagi aiyo so everytime
uh kerja memang kerja from work from home lah tapi once I think about kerja I macam stressed sikit because I've been working twenty four seven
so I rasa macam I need a break lah
I tak boleh visit rumah orang tua lah sia COVID
macam mana I nak visit orang tua tak boleh lah
malas lah I rasa macam I kat duduk kat rumah I sleep cukup
ya betul
everytime tak boleh tidur because got problems trying to sleep lah insomnia kan
mm but then I don't want to take too much ubat also I want to make sure that I can fall asleep naturally
my house mate kan dia balik
then dia tidur kat sini
boyfriend dia tak ada so boyfriend dia tinggal kat tempat dia sendiri lah so
managed to buy me McDonald's breakfast dia ada buy one for one
ah murah
so macam tu lah eh you tahu tak rambut I kan lepas I dye dia merah dah kan
warna dia when my rambut is wet kan warna dia masih like
terlekat kat pillow I
you know my hair ni memang kan red
so I rasa macam
the hair dye that the hairdresser used tak berapa bagus ah because everytime I after when it's wet it's wet
two weeks already and it's will still stain baju kau there is no way that the thing is still like that betul tak
ya exactly this is lepas dua minggu dah and then dia masih stain baju dengan
but only bila dia basah
so it stained like my towel juga lah stain stain merah
mana boleh kalau kering pun it's uh ya but it's
[ah] betul there ah
so but then ah dia beli lah during um during apa ni
Harvey Norman singapore ada sales
jadi dia beli dari Harvey Norman lah
ya it was a a birthday surprise dia order dari Harvey Norman singapore
Harvey Norman singapore tu deliver kat I lah mm and I didn't know then when they ring the doorbell I was like
there was memang kelakar lah because the guy was like this one is for you I said I didn't order this he said oh your mum
so macam tu lah
oh we said we wanted to go to apa ni
and then kita masih belum pergi Holey Moley kan
I pernah dah ajak tapi you sibuk apa
kawan I lah yang seorang lagi
a'ah betul
ya tapi I ajak you you tak reply
sebab I tanya you nak pergi ke tak
pas tu you kau tak reply
tak tahu lah you busy every day lah ada banyak kawan kau
ah betul
uh kalau cycling I pengsan
susah lah I cannot lah if you ask me to go and do all these things
mm betul
ah tak boleh lah exercise
I tahu tapi I you you kan tahu I ni memang malas
nanti gemuk lah
it's okay lah kalau I gemuk
memang lah
oh and then you tahu tak
like sekarang ni kan I memang nak invest in stocks tapi I tak tahu macam mana
do you invest in stocks ke tak
orh I nak tapi I tak tahu macam mana nak start
oh boleh ke
tapi I nak ah
so you dah invest lama ke
oh dah lama ke
because I because I masih muda lagi kan
so I ni kena like willing to take the risk lah
mmhmm betul betul
okay tapi I nak start dengan
okay bagus
tapi because
if you want to invest in the share market you kena apa ni you kena start an account with with your bank right
is it with your banks or bukan macam tu
so macam macam lah
ya kalau gitu pun
ha betul lah
tak ada lah
tak ada lah tak ada investment
sebab itu lah susah sikit that's why I need to start thinking about my future kan
then like worried about like money and then sekarang job I ni pun tak ada commission
so I kena that's why I sekarang ni sibuk nak cari back a sales job so that I can get a bit of commission
project project macam ini kalau kita ada lebih then I don't have to worry so much
kalau project project macam ni memang lah I nak join
so rasanya tak tahu lah kalau mm
the share market investment I memang interested lah but then like
memang nak ah sebab tu that's why originally I was saving up my money untuk apa ni um
untuk sebab I nak belajar sepatutnya
tapi tu juga memang mahal kat
enam puluh ribu lebih susah lah
I rasa macam kalau boleh I nak study medicine juga tapi medicine kan I was thinking should I actually like
so but then career change susah sikit because like
macam mana I nak career change where do I start even kan so kalau I nak buat medicine medicine pun mahal
medicine is kira kira kalau kita study dekat australia
yang tu boleh but then but then you need to have the other additional like training lah
ah other additional training kalau you study dekat australia boleh sebab I ada seorang kawan dia memang
dia study kat monash university and then dia doctor lah kat sini
but then medicine tu mahal lah so
these kind of things you need money also if you want to switch your career and how you want to start all over and get certified so susah sikit lah
tengok lah that's why I pun tak tahu
no it's okay yang tu is out of the window I tak mahu
I nak kerja untuk diri sendiri I nak make sure that you know the money in the bank is mine and that
I tak dependent lah on anybody
parents okay lah kan parents kat singapore macam tu lah
tapi susah sikit lah because you know memang
so when you have two old parents here in singapore you kena
tak tahu lah
ada lah tapi pun susah nak keluarkan so kena tengok lah macam mana
ya betul
so tengok macam mana lah
biasanya bapa yang tak nak pi holiday mak yang nak mak nak pi holiday lah mak pernah pi holiday juga mak I bawa dia pi
I bawa dia pi aiyo banyak tempat lah sebab the job before this kan memang I had to travel and at that time
tak ada COVID lagi tak ada uh tak ada restrictions for travelling so
rasanya I brought her to a lot of places I brought her to
mm mana lagi I brought her to
at first originally kita nak pi vietnam this year sepatutnya I nak bawa dia pi vietnam especially end of the year when it's cold
either vietnam ke chiang mai because she likes cold places lah
and then I wanted to take her to cold places that is not expensive tak terlalu mahal kan
so vietnam atau chiang mai lah tapi sekarang mana mana pun tak boleh pi
so susah sikit lah duduk rumah tengok Netflix jer lah
tak tahu lah
aiyo dia ni
bapa I pun satu suruh dia pi suruh dia pi holiday
johor pun dia tak nak pergi
ah so memang susah lah sikit
ya lah mak I pernah pernah lah she wanted to go via this
travel agency pi holiday tapi susah sikit lah kalau you pi with travel agency I takut
mm tapi kalau they travel with travel agent kan
bukannya mahal ke because they will bring you to all these touristy areas
that like you know that akan charge you like really high prices
so susah sikit bukan
even makanan juga dia bawa you tempat yang mahal
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul lah
mm betul juga
lazarus island tu yang paling jauh I pergi ah duduk ferry tu pun I tertidur dalam ferry
oh betul ke you pernah pergi ke lazarus island oh
oh macam mana hari tu kau pergi
oh betul ke berpeluh
tapi hari tu bila I pi kan cuaca tu tak berapa baik
aku ambil umbrella tu abeh aku jalan from one from since the jetty
to the beach aku dalam umbrella tu sahaja
pas tu we were there only for one hour I dengan kawan I
kawan I ni lah kan dia yang ajak aku pi
then macam mana aku nak dia pun cakap ah tak apa tak apa
nanti tak akan hujan aku memang dah tanya dia aku tanya oh okay even though we have bought the ferry ticket
you nak tukar ke another day ah because
kan sekarang ni hujan lebat then we go there we cannot even picnic ke nak buat apa apa pun tak ada then umbrella pun kecil sangat
so then after that dia cakap tak apa tak apa hujan tak hujan akan err nanti dia akan
uh reda dah ah so kita continue with our trip anyway
so I cakap okay lah continue with our trip and then
enam orang lima orang sorry bukan enam
oh ya betul juga I terlupa lima orang ugh
nampak pula a'ah betul
ya kenapa pula I boleh terkira tambah seorang ah okay tak apa so ada lima orang kan
and payung tu memang kecil kecil ha
and then almost lah the wind blew away the payung and everything so end up we all just sat kat jetty tu waited for the ferry for two hours
ya tapi I memang suka bila dia cuaca tak berapa panas kan bila dia cuaca hujan I memang suka
kan I nak pergi tapi tengok lah kalau weekday I memang tak boleh sebab I kena ambil leave kalau weekend okay lah tapi weekend susah juga sebab I takut ramai orang lah
I ni memang kena clear leave tapi I tak nak ambil
I tak nak ambil leave on a on a weekday that is like a random day kan because I takut like
my boss will also kacau I
ah the the most strategic way of doing this is bila boss I
ah so dia tak akan kacau I
mm betul juga
mm so macam tu lah
huh you go all the way for a massage don't you think that's like really far away tak akan singapore tak ada massage kat sini
oh so biasanya you pandu kereta pergi situ bukan ambil uh apa ni ambil uh train lah
this neighbour of mine kan dia ni memang suka suka
buang sampah dia kat
luar the place where they are supposed to throw the rubbish bukan dalam chute tu tapi buang dekat luar
tak tahu lah and then uh
no or sometimes dia memang dah buka itu chute
so like tapi dia tak tutup properly so then or or they didn't push the rubbish properly into the chute all the way down
so bila I nak buang sampah when I bawa keluar I buka tu sampah tu masih ada kat situ
memang lah macam itu
ya so I wrote an email to management lah then I suruh management please remind everybody to
management cakap okay ah do you know who is in err who is the culprit
mana I boleh tahu hais ask me this kind of questions
macam tu lah
mm betul
minggu ni tak ada lah I nak tidur then I nak tengok Netflix
Netflix sekarang ni I nak tengok uh weekend ni I nak tengok enola holmes and then I nak tengok
I nak tengok
movie tu err kau rasa cinta
kau tak pernah dengar ke movie tu kau rasa cinta
ada lah movie ni popular
because I scared later I fall asleep lah when I tengok K drama
kau ada nampak video TikTok tu yang I bagi you tengok semalam tak
kelakar kan
ya I think I probably spend like six hours on TikTok I even like I ada pun uh send apa ni my job application to TikTok juga
I memang nak kerja dengan TikTok kalau TikTok nak hire I I memang nak
so technically kan I ni memang TikTok researcher dah
so kalau dia nak hire I I boleh cakap this is the amount of time I spend on your product I memang boleh join product you
tak nak lah
as if boleh jadi popular dengan TikTok bukannya senang sangat
tak ada lah
mana boleh senang lah cakap but then when you want to do it kan memang difficult a bit lah
memang uh okay I don't think my voice is merdu lah tapi tengok macam mana lah
malay song mm macam boleh juga tapi I rasa macam bila I cakap malay it's smoother lah kalau nyanyi malay not so
mm eh you tahu tak hari tu kan um
I pergi Holey Moley dengan norza kan I dah cakap tadi
this one seorang lelaki ni dia memang kerja kat situ as a waiter
then after that dia cakap kalau
uh if if he dia memang singaporean lah tapi dia ada relatives kat malaysia
budak melayu lah ni so then after that dia cakap oh um next time kalau you nak make booking kat Holey Moley for a table reservation ke apa you boleh call I lah
so dia ambil nombor I
then after that dia letak mm ah then then dia ambil nombor I then dia letak nombor dia dalam telefon I sebab telephone I memang ada kat
kat meja so then dia cakap eh you ambil lah nombor telephone I so next time kalau you nak reserve apa ke
you boleh call I so I cakap okay that's fine I'll do it
dia asyik text I
and I dah bagi tahu dia yang memang I dah ada boyfriend
and dia cakap oh
uh kalau dia dia cakap hari tu dia cakap apa ah
uh dia cakap oh
um bila you free
I nak bawa you keluar uh and then dia then dia cakap I nak bawa you keluar dengan Vespa I
Vespa dia then aku cakap um
kenapa I nak duduk Vespa kalau public transportation memang ada air con
then tapi ya so no lah but it's not just that it was like I dah memang dah bagi tahu yang I ada boyfriend
tapi dia masih muka tebal tau and then dia masih text I so I rasa macam
that's really weird so I I just straight up was like honest dengan dia and I bagi tahu lah that like
ah so I rasa macam dia tak ada boundary actually the thing was
I only save nombor dia sebab dia cakap
that kalau next time I nak reserve table I boleh call dia so I ingat like service dia bagus ke apa I wanted to write like a feedback on Facebook
kat Holey Moley yang dia ni memang baik ke apa
tapi turns out dia ni memang tak like like
asyik kacau I jer so I rasa macam a bit
mm macam tu lah
uh saya rasa I saya tak nak
I memang dah berterus terang I dah cakap I ada boyfriend
then after that dia ah then dia masih muka tebal lagi dia cakap oh
oh um I okay jer uh because dia cakap oh
um um so I would like to invite you for my birthday dinner then I'm I cakap
ah then aku rasa aku tanya dia only you and me
then dia cakap tak lah then they said uh then he said
dengan kawan kawan I
then dia cakap with a group of friends bukan you dengan I jer then the then he said
I tahu you you you tak you tak nak hang out one on one
tapi I okay jer
then I rasa macam the way he responded to it was very
it doesn't matter if you are okay with it ke tidak because you are
tapi kalau orang dah ada boyfriend atau girlfriend I don't think it's
ah so macam tu lah
then then aku tanya dia just you and I then dia cakap tak lah dengan kawan kawan I
tapi dia masih hari ni lagi ajak I pergi birthday dinner
pas tu I cakap
dia and then the way dia cakap kan
dia text I dia cakap oh
so I was but bukan I yang ajak dia keluar dia yang nak ajak I then I was like
mungkin you kena panggil uh then I said err maybe you just enjoy with your friends lah and have a good
pas tu dia cakap um
dia cakap err
bila I free
so it's like again you are coming back to that topic when I dah cakap
I memang dah tak bagi signal apa I tak uh it it's totally no signal it's disconnected
so I rasa macam it's just
ya but any way aku dah tak reply dia lah
ya betul juga
bukan lah dah pernah happen a number of times
no lah I mean uh no but anyway ya that was just off topic so coming back to this um apa ni COVID kan so um
in london COVID nineteen memang dah um
mm macam that time dalam kat australia
mm yang tu pernah happen dalam japan pun and then now they said that the
the virus dah mutate
betul juga but then only the young ones will have herd immunity the old ones would not be able to survive or the ones with underlying disease
so yang tu yang susah lah
mm tapi vaccine sekarang pun macam ada side effect
because I think sekarang ada tiga company yang tengah buat vaccine
no there is one that's Sanofi albert dengan AstraZeneca
Pfizer juga I think all of them are on board with that kot
sekarang ni albert memang memang apa ni uh memang aggressive to to do COVID because I nampak ada
for a number of um albert punya infectious disease department
ada lah tapi dia tak call I balik because I tak ada experience dalam infectious disease kot
mungkin boleh juga tengok macam mana lah
ada lah I think now they are busy with the campaign the presidential campaign it feels like I feel like this COVID thing has
yang U orang dengan dengan like
so that's why it turns out everybody pula yang terkena COVID
I rasa lah yang ni I rasa lah
ya betul
ya betul
betul lah
mm betul juga
but it's true I mean uh you know negara kita ni
memang lebih bagus lah
negara lain lain di southeast asia tapi negara kita ni memang
memang you know as much as what anybody else says negara kita ni memang terbaik
orang orang lain nak masuk negara kita untuk kerja kan orang malaysia ni
orang indonesia
orang china orang philippines kan ah
there err and memang ada semangat
nationality lah kat singapore
mm betul
ah ang moh tu apa ang moh
oh ang moh tu orang putih lah
oh okay okay ha betul lah
ya betul
jadi mungkin minggu ni kita nak pi botanical gardens ke tak
ya sebab I rasa
betul juga sebab I rasa macam botanical gardens ada satu cafe yang memang cantik
then dia ada like I pernah pergi dah lama dah um
and then dia ada yang rooftop tu memang glass rooftop and dia transparent and then boleh nampak everything
bukan Wildseed Wildseed ke kat botanical gardens bukan Wildseed tu terlalu
nampak dia terlalu nice and terlalu expensive yang tempat ni memang basic tapi makanan dia okay juga
mm tak tahu kalau ramai ke tak mungkin kita kalau kita pergi
pagi-pagi kan then tak akan lah begitu
jadi kau tidur lah awal sikit
okay then kalau gitu kan I dah cakap
kita pergi botanical gardens makan breakfast so macam mana kita nak makan breakfast kalau nanti lambat lambat
okay boleh juga
kalau ramai tengok lah kalau boleh reserve ke apa nanti kita Google lah
mm lepas botanical gardens I nak pergi
mm I nak balik tidur
sebab you kan tahu I ni memang bangun awal okay kalau lepas botanical gardens maybe kita gi orchard tengok ada benda nak shopping ke tak
ramai orang kan a'ah ya lah
so okay kalau tak pergi orchard then kita nak pergi mana lepas ni eh
ah sentosa buat apa sentosa tu memang kena booking sekarang kau tahu tak
kena chope
to masuk
sebab tu everywhere sekarang ni kena chope then baik tinggal kat rumah jer aku tengok Netflix lah cukup
mm boleh juga tapi kan you sebab you pandu kereta so senang sikit tapi kalau untuk I I kena like
tengok mana yang convenient sikit kalau terlalu jauh I memang
you tahu lah I ni memang singaporean
kalau jauh sangat I tak nak travel
kalau I tak ada kereta lah kalau ada kereta okay lah
ya betul lah
mm boleh juga
boleh boleh juga mm
jadi I rasa macam
ah okay lah dah lewat
and I pun sudah nak tidur you dah nak tidur ke tak
mm betul I juga
esok I kerja tapi lepas ni I akan kerja lagi sebab I kena habiskan benda mmhmm
selalu banyak lah tapi I'm I also like procrastinated a little bit
because I rasa macam malas nak kerja cause every day I've been working non-stop kan
hmm so rasa macam tired sikit lah but I need to finish this project
betul lah
ya betul because um tadi house mate I baru cakap uh kawan dia
uh kawan dia punya husband ke apa atau mungkin kawan dia lah dia ni memang pilot
um dengan apa ni ke apa lah and then after that lost the job and now buat kat macam customer service or something lah
pay but have to still pay for the mortgage and such so ya susah sikit lah
oh so wife dia tak ada job lah
oh tapi dia ada apply ke tak untuk job
ah betul
so dia ada like that has she reached the level whereby like
dia memang dah interview and they've asked her to do a presentation
ada lah but didn't get the job oh wah susah kalau gitu kan lepas everytime kena buat presentation one after the other and then tak dapat job tu
dia kerja dalam what err what sector
oh dalam pun kena retrenchment
wah teruk lepas tu
tapi dia ada err package tak
ada lah then okay lah kalau ada package maybe because dia enam belas tahun dah
oh then okay lah yang tu
orh betul juga
mm betul then dia tak ada commitment
mm betul
ya and freeze hiring kan ya betul juga
bonus pun tak ya bonus pun tak ada
dengar dengar lah dari kawan I memang bonus pun tak ada
ya bukannya the COVID thing has been solved aiyo if we go through another year like that teruk lah macam mana
harap-harap lah kita dapat lebih project macam ini
kalau kita dapat bagus lah kan
mm betul juga
um I nak cakap terima kasih ya joann err sebab hari ni datang rumah I belanja I makan
terima kasih ya so kita tengok lah kalau err minggu ni
weekend nanti kita akan maybe jumpa lagi kat botanical gardens makan breakfast ya
bagus lah
ya that was back then lah but sekarang dah kena buang kan so tak ada guna ah nak tengok tu semua balik
so aku rasa lebih aman ah kat sana
ah saudi arabia ah mecca rasanya kat mecca sana semua
no aku
uh aku tak pasti ah apa pasal corruption ni semua tapi I did read over the news that uh ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself ah but then
amazing I would say sebab dorangnya taste
a bit different from asian nya culture dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit lah and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I will to get a chance to meet messi ah you know I like I mean both of us like to watch and play football right so if there's a chance I would want to go there and meet him ah tapi
disebabkan COVID period kan aku rasa no chance lah nak gi sana nak jumpa atau maybe kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada chance kot
maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau in singapore
so far aku rasa dorang dah main dah start main cuma it's just that no ah spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will ah suffer a lot of loss ah cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue lah
actually tu yang aku pelik ah but then uh I did make a research ah on the internet and I found out that uh they make money through uh fans memberships the merchandises like example err satu apa ni baju bola kan they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe what so kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover lah you know before the
ya aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat facebook apa semua especially in singapore err aviation macam-macam kerja ah ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya err kita tengok singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial ah aids to um singaporeans ah
ah tak lah sekarang aku rest jer kat rumah sebab uh apa to stay close ah with my family
sebab you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective lah but I would say it's hard lah ah you know to find a job that ah that is suitable with me tapi
ye lah aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit savings aku ah alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat save for the past err
months that I've been working as air steward kalau tak mungkin aku kerja lah cari mana-mana kerja
aku actually risau juga cuma
alhamdulillah again aku dapat save quite a lot
I mean aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau kan but then ya I would err the savings that I save
oh ye lah aku
aku baca hari tu kat facebook juga
ah apa kerja as a swabber is it they could earn like
maybe cause err they are finding people who are willing to work uh a risk a risky job lah tu pasal they are willing to pay that much
tapi to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer lah sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi maybe it's better if government pay them lah you know
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera lah you know tapi
nak cakap susah memang lah susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan kan jadi tu lah aku pun wonder on how singapore would cope with this um COVID nineteen lah
and tu pasal aku rasa penting lah untuk err ada plan lah untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada family atau beli rumah aku rasa
err you know a lot of children I don't know lah maybe for them it's a rezeki but in terms of singapore context
primary school children kan tak payah bayar school fees ke or maybe edusave bagi lebih banyak sikit ke you know
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this aku kadang-kadang pening ah sebab aku dapat gaji jer aku kena kasi
apa ni adik-adik aku eh sorry adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik kan aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar bill aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi ah then aku kadang-kadang barely aku cuma ada kadang-kadang five hundred for myself like in every month
so walaupun I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
I mean I sometimes I really wonder macam mana orang-orang yang err sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak lah you know rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar tau dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar bill
being raped which I'm totally uh angry about tapi tu lah aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk singapore mungkin kalau aku ironman mungkin aku akan pergi sana lah aku nak save dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa kan dorang ah
tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau err ye lah sedara kau sendiri
tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil I mean mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi
ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua I really
ya I really err I'm really disappointed that um the muslims are treated that way and also another case is sekarang ni happening in this world is
uh present representation of the whole community and as you can see in eh aku tengok err kenapa police dorang err
apa treat all those uh black people with such violence and brutality
where recently kalau kau tengok news err satu orang dorang siapa nama dia george floyd was killed
err aku tak tahu apa yang tak
police police tu fikir lah sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa err orang tu dia setakat err apa ni ada fake duit jer which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
err orang masih boleh you know kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa kan aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma
dekat sana ada this thing called bumiputera where the malays are given
wanted to buy this house at taman melawati lah you know in kuala lumpur or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
you have you don't have that bumiputera rights where you can
should be bersyukur you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually kan kalau dorang gi klinik they could actually
they uh dorang cuma perlu bayar one ringgit jer tau one ringgit for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
they err they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke I mean
okay ah berdosa tu dah another level dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat
duit eh rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
kapal apa yacht eh I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something wah that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister lah like that you know what you think about that
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and mesti dia akan dapat lawyer yang bagus-bagus ah and he might win the case and just uh go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years ah so
is a joke you know is a joke you know kau kau tengok ah kita punya uh how how well
actually actually memang ada tapi err
uh he he's called the yang berhormat speaker you know he's the man in the centre that uh will call on each uh each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
I really err you know in melayu ah they say kesian ah with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say eh speaker diam lah eh speaker apa ini you know they are very chaotic you know and
bro uh I don't find it weird ah cause sebab apa tau
all of the ministers actually ada fake degree you know he actually beli
di apa a fake degree on internet or something or apa eh dia suruh orang
pergi ambil degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something lah I mean memalukan seh kau
I mean kau dah tak
kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat kan sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus and
are recruited uh based on merit lah you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya aku aku happy ah macam singapore ada government yang stable ah walaupun ye lah ramai kata apa lah ni minister ni tak bagus lah minister tu tak bagus tapi
aku rasa kita nya government quite stable lah and aku happy to see that ya
eh actually aku terima soalan ni banyak gila ah dulu kan aku
aku fikir aku nak duduk malaysia the reason being is that
ah the peace and financial freedom mungkin sebab masa tu I mean still uh sampai sekarang lah aku masih kerja kat singapore kan and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted uh into the malaysian currency it's time apa times three apa so satu dolar tiga ringgit and you when you go there kau boleh spend apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa spa apa bagai and kau boleh buat apa-apa ah tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana
and kau kerja kat sana eh you might not be uh spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia ringgit example you are earning two thousand ringgit in malaysia
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik bus atau naik motor pergi kerja sini and okay lah mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
sebab ya the you know the okay example kau bangun pukul empat pagi then kau kerja sampai lima pagi and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam
and you know kau barely have time for yourself ah you know kau rasa kau akan do that for a long term or
you know try to spend two thousand ringgit in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand ringgit I mean
of course ah it's not easy for them I mean aku pun ada sedara kat malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in ah you know dalam kampung-kampung semua and um kalau kat singapore apa orang kata is it or gross income lah dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit
atau seribu lima ratus ringgit and
it's still tak cukup you know cause they are living in a dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang I mean mungkin barang-barang murah tapi
ye lah barang-barang lain macam bill makanan apa semua lah macam-macam and still tak cukup untuk dorang so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles ah so we cannot justify on what they are facing ah but kan in singapore itself it's very hard you know
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is haram
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore lah you know penting gila I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to tolong you to to uh you know to give duit I mean
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains ah birth rate in singapore is declining kan orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab
ya dorang risau kan apa tak uh tak ada tak cukup duit lah tak ada time and
aku tak faham ah kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada maid aku tak akan ambil maid untuk jaga anak aku sebab
I I want to be there for my own children I don't want to I don't want my child to be nurtured by another stranger you know I want to you know besar I want to saya aku nak besar kan anak aku dengan kasih sayang aku sendiri bukan
setakat kerja daripada pagi sampai malam balik tengok sekejap they don't know I want to be there for them
you know give them kasih sayang lah kau kau rasa tak pelik ke kalau anak kau you know dibesarkan dijaga oleh maid and maybe one day dorang tak kenal kau atau maybe dorang sayang maid lebih dari kau
gitu lah I mean
to have a to have enough money is very important lah singapore kan kalau kau
kau kau bayang kan kau spend
it's not even compulsory pun to have your own wedding
so yang penting I mean in our religion islam kita nikah dah cukup
tak penting pun then after that
ya I mean the the money that you supposedly want wanted to spend on your wedding right might as well you spend dekat kau punya rumah kau can pay lebih deposit
ya lah aku rasa rumah and uh duit um savings untuk anak kau lagi penting lah
I don't know ah okay sekarang sekarang err I'm in army kan so
ya I think sekarang sudah tak boleh tak boleh pergi
like you cannot go places a lot of places ah banyak banyak banyak tempat tak boleh pergi
atau dia punya ada limit
ada limit to entry ah
err kalau ah tak tak tak sekarang masih masih five juga
ah betul
mm bukan ah
I don't know but I think tengok tengok apa like orang lain yang instagram stories nampak
ada ramai orang cakap tak ada in the same venue tapi
so macam
ah macam pagi family then err petang just kawan-kawan dengan friends
oh iya ke
ah yours is ah that yang yang jemputan
ah evening semalam only semalam I posted about it
so macam it's a bit contradictory
macam err
memang I don't keep myself up to date that much
ah uh huh memang memang betul betul
I sudah tengok apa kebanyakan orang kan
okay kalau tengok in army in army
berbeza kalau compared to police dengan itu memang
macam for example pack
lapan pack
sekali dengan diagnose ah
ah pasal for us like
kita memang tak banyak apa berbual dengan apa orang lain lah
ah betul
satu tahun belum lepas kau nak two years okay okay tak apa
for some people kalau they didn't go to

after these two years of apa earning money

kalau nak belajar ya okay maybe bila kat uni kan uni kalau tinggal hall ke
this is gonna be super senang for me
apa okay
ya alah so this is my last semester kan sekarang so
classes that's only like once a week so aku macam like
but it's so much like cause the previous semesters uh I was like so freaking like stressed but now I'm still stressed lah you know sebab sekolah standard but now I feel like
so I was supposed to submit an assignment not assignment lah like a task macam homework yesterday but then like she didn't give me my feedback sought
aku mad ah so I didn't submit
for my time table tak banyak apa punya classes
macam like start at like twelve but like the bad part is balik rumah like lambat so
kau stand out sikit lah
no kau tahu that kind of situation where ada orang wave kat kau and then they're not actually waving at you
so why so kenapa kau mad kat aku for the okay uh huh
so kau fikir yang
you thought like I was giving you some uh attitude gitu lah okay got it
oh kau tengah flex on aku pasal dover dover oof
sometimes I really miss just like being able to like pergi sekolah kau without
I thought kata takde like COVID punya
orh I think confirm like my sekolah mala is like
confirm ah tak halal mala
cause like I went cause remember I told you last week the korean punya stall aunty dia kata
oh aku dapat apa ada mala and I saw like my malay friend apa apa nama dia uh izzah from izzah is from band remember izzah my
yang tu ya ya ya
pray I was like to allah to count my blessings semua
no I have you eaten there before kau pernah makan
oh ya the daging mahal ya
that time aku makan dengan arlef uh makan mala dekat I think it was last year
the duck rasa lemak dia sedap
your bapa never let you go makan
macam not my type of food do you agree
no like no the one yang at Ichikokudo
to me rasa dia terlampau rasa dia terlampau lemak because aku makan dia punya
the fact that it's garlic dia dah cut
but it was super like lemak for some reason and cause I didn't take spice I didn't put the spice also why didn't you going as far as I didn't like wanted to be
ya stomach aku ada problem bro aku tak boleh makan spicy food period
tapi I that time I eh you know oh my god I forgot to tell you about this
no because when you add less of the sauce dia punya flavor
to me untuk aku because Samyang kan uh the normal noodles dia punya calories about five hundred
sebab you know like you put it like there's less ties to numb your tongue
to me dia nya carbonara dia nya rasa terlampau
almost bukan
dia nya rasa almost bukan Samyang and babe abeh dia punya noodles also not macam
something that aku eat
aku tak makan that kind of stuff
kau makan dia punya cup atau dia punya
no cup atau the packet
oh aku prefer aku think there's a like a
the cup one I feel like it doesn't like kau try makan Samyang cup biasa not even carbonara the texture semua lain what
no kenyal is like err perkataan yang betul
oh you kau tengah looking through universities eh
paolo kat yes correct
oo aku uh dia punya course is uh sciences sosial
kejap eh
oh dorang ada human resource dengan uh itu
passionate tentang human resource
okay aku I I know akan
sound a bit dunia
I don't know tapi sebab
macam aku really nak try pergi overseas ah
aku just thinking because it might it's not really plausible for me to go overseas because of finances
macam a real thing is it will take two years only if I go overseas
instead of three years I'm aku looking at western australia nya uni kan kat perth
abeh dia punya fees about thirty eight thousand
tiga puluh lapan ribu uh per tahun
if aku punya is eligible untuk scholarship
abeh accommodation I can stay with my uncle tapi dia punya orang was like betul ke kau nak tinggal dengan uncle kau
ya abeh when she was talking to me dia kata are you sure you really wanna stay with your aunty because I mean it's not really a good idea kan untuk tinggal dengan kau punya sepupu semua
so aku fikir forty thousand extra that's
true sebab aku punya uncle dengan aku punya aunty dorang punya rumah is
quite near to university tau like macam actually dekat
abeh dorang ada banyak bilik spare cause dorang nya anak semua dah besar dah kahwin
tapi kalau gitu I have to take a gap year untuk kerja dapat duit
ya abeh kerja kat mana
dah start eh
a'ah betul
dah besar lah
mak dia nak ikut dia pergi overseas
oh mak dia attached to her eh
no but sebab dia dia youngest in the family what so I think it's like expected ah
tapi what I thought you said she's like financially like
tapi her mum let lah is it taking a loan
daphne is the one yang
oh tapi when kau tengah keluar dengan kawan kau do you guys talk about pelajaran atau completely like no
oh so your yours are just casual friends ah like bukan competitive
oh korang macam united ah
eh tapi elisa dia nak pergi university mana satu
dorang ada plan
tapi elisa mak dia bagi tak kalau dia nak
kerja sana kan
kau tahu tak the main macam
sebab that people nak pergi negeri lain kan is because dorang nak migrate tau
like for example kan aku pergi uh perth for university there most likely I would want to settle down there also
that kind of like no as in like if people go macam for
like uh someone from singapore dorang nak uh apa
belajar kat america boston university
so it's like it's meant to like macam
facilitate dorang untuk keluar negeri kita
so macam like the thing about ambil
I saw this uh tweet pasal this guy they took a hundred thousand loan tak salah aku hundred thousand ke hundred fifty thousand untuk uh go to apa university di america
abeh lepas tu he he they took a very big loan right but he got a job starting salary tujuh ribu
so it's like macam the starting pay is a lot what seven thousand is a lot eh
ya I mean if I feel like in negeri america
dorang nya starting pay quite high seh
untuk ah aku punya perspective
no bukan hope it's more of worry macam if aku pergi overseas education what if aku tak boleh bayar balik
right ten year gitu kan
mmhmm abeh ya
not really I didn't make much memories that's why I want to make sure aku punya university aku make as much memories as possible
kalau boleh aku nak give it another run lah
not choose my class kau tahu kan time aku masuk poly I actually chose to be in O two
and that time dina was my only friend kawan aku satu jer
so aku was like okay let me just be in the same class as dina but if I were to redo it again I would appeal into the same course I don't know
I think kalau boleh aerospace sia
but ya so about local university kau nak pergi mana satu and like
not like like course sebab I know kau tak tahu like
uh kau I think I can see you're like interested dalam
bidang uh social services
is it kau punya internship open up your eyes
oh kau tak nak ah
the jutawan di dalam kelas kamu
aku percaya dia ah
oh return of investment gitu eh
um okay investment aku boleh percaya
tapi hundred thousand tu aku tak boleh percaya
oil banyak ah tapi
mana parents dia dapat duit tu untuk start investment in the first place
oh kalau gitu aku macam boleh percaya sikit
ah sikit ah
uh tapi okay lah makes sense tapi ya you were saying dia punya internship
oh kau share tentang internship kau eh
uh huh tu nanti
ya period abeh dia end up kerja di mana
tapi same place tapi online
dia business vibes ah
oh tentang addison rae
aku just I think I'm aku just
dia seorang businesswoman yang sangat gigih
dia jumpa kourtney kardashian
aku rasa kan dia yang paling banyak um
dia punya dia seorang yang sangat gembira all the time
no no the thing the thing yang aku sedikit marah
eh marah
kau do you know avani
kau pernah nampak videos dia tak
no no no kau pernah nampak video dia tak
dengan james charles eh
no aku rasa the only reason I mean I know you say jangan tengok video dia kalau tak suka kan
tapi the only the thing is I don't think dia deserve all this fame
dia punya ya
aku tengok dia collab dengan james charles tau di YouTube
and when they were talking she was completely sangat bosan as a person like I literally macam couldn't
ya abeh charli d'amelio pun aku rasa she don't deserve I mean she's a good dancer
ni something yang aku have been thinking about ah serious
ya nice but does nice deserve hundred million followers kau kata yes ke tak
no aku rasa okay what makes me like a bit angry about charli d'amelio is dia punya latest video dengan maddie ziegler
the dorang buat makeup
dan the way she talk is so soft okay soft can be a good personality but it's like no substance and like no
ya that itu apa apa aku fikir lah tentang situasi ini
but then again their net worth is like berapa million so aku have nothing on them
oh okay aku faham
cuma aku just uh aku baik dengan dorang aku aku think dorang sangat
dorang dah dalam bidang menari dan stuff like that
tapi I just don't think they deserve this much followers lah
based on how they talk like they cannot talk they can't host like macam
circumstantial I feel like because of quarantine semua orang dalam uh
phone dorang so
and I think dorang punya it factor comes from not talking it's just the videos they make
ya so I don't think dorang deserve all these big opportunities you know
yang uh miniman yang baru eh
oh yang trend baru eh
no I don't aku tak minum Starbucks ah bro
oh kau dapat anxiety macam mana
oh ya malam tu eh
kau that time yang aku minum kopi aku nak pass out kau ingat
ya no is yang I drank the whole cold brew remember
yang kita minum tau it's like that coffee drink
that night yang aku nak pass out sebab aku exercise after that
ya aku nya heart was already like dying aku literally was like
abeh I thought running would help it but running makes your heart rate high but then it like macam complicates things aku literally was like about to pass out
drink coffee at all that time aku minum uh
I didn't like I eat at twelve you know like usual lunch tapi aku belum makan dinner and it was already like six and I was already very hungry no snacks nothing
so I was like hmm mak aku ada instant coffee so aku nak try minum jer lah
so aku minum then after that it was okay
but then I ate dinner at about seven thirty gitu like one hour later
time aku makan dinner suddenly aku rasa macam light not light-headed tau macam
abeh tu semua masa nak pass out terus I had to like stop dinner and like sit and like drink water
ya weird kan aku banyak pass out situations sia
ya tak boleh serious
aku macam aku just don't drink air flavoured ah
uh usually I get the like the like the fruity type macam kat rumah amira that time I drank
aku constantly telling you
Sharetea nya lemak kan rasa dia
it's like sikit tea
like two per cent tea abeh ninety nine per cent milk
dekat Dunkin' kau beli matcha I didn't know what doughnuts you buy but anyways
mochi doughnut mana satu tu
oh right aku tak tahu
oh kau pun manis
semalam aku keluar dengan nurin
no semalam aku makan kau tahu remember the Texas Chicken punya biscuit shortcake
ya I didn't I yesterday aku makan yong tau foo for macam six aku dah lapar gila kan
aku eat the same thing all the time
ya aku always get normal
abeh lepas tu uh nurin nak dessert ah
abeh uh kita pergi Texas Chicken tapi aku macam a bit full still macam kembung gitu
so aku macam tak ah then she bought the chocolate one
aku rasa dia ni ya allah sedap seh aku regret not getting one for myself
aku was too full like my stomach was
aku dah lama tak treat myself ah to be honest
eh tapi sekarang oh I think in terms of food I mean
um recently actually aku nowadays tak spend banyak in all honesty
aku tak shopping tak beli baju seluar semua
tapi that time yang before school starts aku beli ASOS I bought jeans
I already refund dah refund tapi I bought another one that is the right fit ah
abeh aku beli one
ya on monday aku yang black pants tu
ya aku pakai tu

abeh aku beli the black
macam sweatshirt tu yang baju tebal sikit
for rainy days aku kan world
oh aku oh sweater
it's just a normal macam pullover
tak ada it's oversized abeh aku beli from SHEIN
eh SHEIN nya kan dia punya price and quality not bad eh for dia nya price ya
buat apa dorang nak steal
I bought everything from I think I bought three items satu grey sweatpants
baju like this long sleeve oversized also I like macam
I act like aku in a cold country tapi tak
and also aku beli this macam cute short fitted shirt but I haven't wear it yet
dah I got it like last week or last two weeks
I I think mine dah expire

tapi next year I think march baru aku start main lagi ah
tapi lia lia's online constantly
dia dia sedikit world
oh ni seluar ni
kat ne lah
oh kau tahu
tapi ASOS constantly ada twenty per cent
that time for Apple pay pun you get twenty per cent then got now got another one
no I think dorang nya price price dorang inflate for by twenty percent at first
no untuk apa what's the purpose
that time door skin kau tak beli ke
no you did the kasut hitam yang lawa tu
oh tak eh
no like macam a nice shoe like a door kind of vibe
I don't know lah aku lupa
eh lepas ni kau nak makan

but cause I aku today quite busy seh I have to like do my notes and then I have a meeting at two then tonight I have a meeting at eight
tapi macam we all need to start ah
eh aku dah boleh book aku nya test tau
belum sebab dia nya date tak suitable
uh the simulator bukan ikut stage doesn't care doesn't matter
you just go to kau punya new bookings
lepas tu kau tekan simulator there's three that you have to go through
twenty five dollars each tak salah
sebab kalau tak like I like I don't want you to clash with school
uh dia nya first yang basic dengan
okay not to flex tapi aku aku masuk
uh aku masuk bilik aku masuk lambat kan dia nya final theory room
oh student do not required to book simulator lessons for this course means kau manual tak yah naik tak yah itu ke
or maybe sebab kau sekolah bukan private
kau next time kau tanya instructor kau ah when's your next uh lesson driving
tak ada opening
he only manjas me when he need something macam nak makan gitu baru he come to me
tapi kalau tak he ignore me he got attitude one
tapi semalam molly macam manja dengan aku sikit so aku macam okay
semalam aku pergi Muji let's talk about Muji sekarang
tapi kau not there what
ya but yesterday I aku gi Muji untuk get a notebook like that
on my laptop tapi tak macam aku rasa macam tak lit kan tulis laptop I I prefer handwritten ah
a'ah betul
hari ni hari apa ah
halloween hari apa
hari ni twenty nine esok
hari sabtu eh sabtu is saturday kan okay period
kenapa bad terms
macam mana amira tahu yang safirah nangis
apa safirah kata
no aku aku macam tak
but aku just feel like safirah do you think safirah overreact atau like she react accordingly
aku just tak suka rafi ah
no macam when I first nampak rafi I knew I I wasn't gonna like him
but most of the time aku punya intuition is right though whenever I have a bad feeling about someone it always happens
wait what other things aku I remember like getting a lot of things right macam regarding all these sus things
but aku feel like aku reacted accordingly though like
that's why I don't feel like super bad because aku rasa just safirah is like overreacting
ya tak no kejap aku nak explain dengar aku dulu
okay so basically yang pasal tu yang kita keluar dengan xu shi aku xu shi dengan safirah makan
safirah kan masuk Instagram dia then I was like I told safirah I'm super angry
aku macam nak message dia gitu ah macam just to
say everything ah macam like why you do this to safirah and all abeh safirah was like no
cause she dia tak reply aku tau do you dia reply kau
abeh apa perasaan kau when dia reply
apa perassan kau when safirah replied
apa kau punya fikiran tentang business dari rumah
oh kau suka makan benda manis-manis eh
oh ya doughnuts are nice to me aku suka doughnuts tapi it's like air
aku that time the last time aku makan doughnuts is the Swee Heng aku suka yang that kind of doughnuts
yang sedap yang besar abeh ada chocolate rice kat atas so sedap
ya I feel like Dunkin' Donut nya lagi air airy
kan macam tak tak tak kenyang
oh kau suka complicated flavours ah kira kan
aku just rasa
sedikit sedih ah tentang this situation
safirah needs I told I told my mum about situasi safirah tau about the entire break up
abeh aku macam aku I know safirah dia terlampau serious untuk relationship
kahwin which is good
is bukan perkara yang jahat tau untuk buat gini
tapi aku rasa dia terlampau serious when the guys are literally like
mana macam it's macam tak add up gitu
like dia nak settle down sekarang which is so unrealistic at this modern day and age
like when dia message dia kata oh kenapa semua orang atau semua orang masih sekolah
she's nineteen lah I mean like kalau nak kahwin at least twenty three baru find a real like a serious one lah
I feel like it's a bit macam terlampau cepat
my mum my mum said macam you shouldn't like you gonna break your heart
you know what I mean like it's so tiring to like go into this cycle macam kau percaya orang ni
abeh last last dia pecah kan hati kau macam gitu jer
ya tapi aku just feel bad ah
then macam do you know about safirah punya parents
no but because like I was also telling my mum like macam my mum said if you come from a stable family
like most likely you won't be out there macam looking for like
no macam like falling like for the first guy you talked to that kind of vibe
that was uh itu yang terjadi kepada irfan apa the first time also
dia punya dorang nya family messed up kan irfan nya
ya eh ni ni skirt yang kau pakai that day eh yang plaid ni
buat kan
sebab dah besar kan
moyang apa ah
damn you saw your moyang
okay uh kau nak start
aku join poly through which is the polytechnic foundation programme so from N levels supposed aku gi
ada ada minat ah so aku tak ada problem
eh tapi
aku tengah doing muay thai
dari silat then go squash
aku tak tahu is just
it's not my thing ah dikir barat
tak tahu ah aku rasa stage fright
then maybe because of that abeh dikir barat as I see is quite interesting ah like to watch not to do it yourself you get ya so
that's the difference ah aku sebab
err that is macam
macam tu aku fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school aku
uh sepak takraw pe so
that that competition macam orang tengok is normal
aku since young uh aku
not really sociable lah aku is a introvert ya
since primary school lah aku introvert so
but primary school lah aku still had this macam close friends so aku still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
still join takraw which is good and made a lot of friends there
okay that's the tough part sebab aku
aku didn't really got problem thus aku student counsellor so so aku tak boleh macam mess up lah so basically but the student council part also aku it wasn't
and then err dorang kira kan
sebab aku really from a
aku considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor lah in sec two ya
aku actually tak nak sebab aku just just malas ah then so uh the funny thing is
aku didn't even go for the interview even though I had to lah
dorang dorang naik dekat uh assembly hall panggil aku dorang tanya err
okay aku cakap ah I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say oh you got duty today then I'm like what
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya nanti ada orang hantar aku
go to sick bay nanti aku cakap stomachache and all that
guilty tak sangat right ya then
but to be honest aku rasa dorang tahu lah tapi dorang just macam
macam okay ah can just go just go
aku first job aku was uh burger king which aku finds
so aku just join and then they quickly like train me
after staff day takde lagi
kind of lah because dorang macam err kira kan
uh business kecil so uh
macam referral kan so aku kerja
I think aku dapat thirty forty
kau kerja is a different environment
so kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam some ah a'ah macam gitu just at some park or some event
eh apa dah kerja
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about sebab aku lagi prefer hands on
rather than macam
so next year kita dua gi internship
you quite excited ah untuk shore
uh aku
so aku gi belayar second sem
which is exciting ah untuk aku sebab aku pun join sebab dia punya sailing the part
exciting tapi
scary juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam
sebab aku pun planning uh
aku start family and all that so ya
even though internship kau dapat shore kan
aku rasa there's still a chance untuk kau sail in the future you know macam kalau kau still carry on with this career then aku rasa why not kau ada dia punya diploma kau ada experience
takyah disappointed sangat
kau stuck at shore
yes sebab untuk aku err
aku rather sacrifice
aku punya time untuk uh
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine macam
ah exactly jadi untuk aku macam it's worth it lah kau go for six months
then got free for like like three months gitu three or more then
macam by the time aku reach macam tiga puluh empat puluh is
even workshop takpe sia fun so
aku suka ah
honestly following the trend kan aku rasa aku
we'll probably be posted to firefighting tapi personally aku nak army
ya sebab
aku tak tahu ah aku just
aku ada interest in the armed forces juga
kira the army navy ataupun air force ah
tapi firefighting pun untuk aku okay
tapi aku really tak nak
um macam dari dari kecil
aku main bola bawah blok ke apa kan atau aku gi skate ke apa nanti dorang datang screen abeh
ya and then since young aku had that uh
image of them macam dorang just
datang sini screen screen macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah
err aku pergi seven eleven beli maggi apa kan aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang screen check check EZ-link semua aku don't find it
macam practical lah macam kau just kacau aku kan at this point ah so I never really had the interest for police
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag aku
maybe dorang check rokok ke apa abeh aku
aku just found it like like weird lah to be honest like until now also I still feel
I I take it personally ah sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at nanti dorang tengok aku
dorang tengok eh kadang-kadang dorang panggil and dorang check bag aku macam just
but ya that's why aku tak nak police
then kau
eh tapi air force
macam mana nak cakap eh
macam ada engineering punya part ada communications punya part
I because to be pilot also susah
kalau dorang offer kau untuk macam uh continue
posted to air force eh kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam
I think boleh tau sebab the thing is I went for the
ah ada dorang macam test kau punya
so macam
err aku betul-betul nak so
months before that kan aku aku practice with this movie so aku aku tengok youtube video
aku take online test
unfortunately aku tak dapat ah dorang tak bilang score
sebab dia ada aku rasa eight to ten different tests
uh ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah
honestly overall aku rasa aku did not bad
ya so tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat
okay obviously kalau ada
aku aku definitely would
honestly kalau
the job areas like engineering atau uh communications
kalau pilot lah who don't mind
sebab dia punya cockpit dia ada dia punya ah
aku tengok macam national days semua kan nanti ada dia punya jet like cool lah untuk aku
sama sama sama six years
so macam aku untuk aku primary school is when you develop your own uh character
sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku primary macam the most important
but ya primary school aku is uh
I think to through sepak takraw also
err develop aku punya own personality
is aku
I'm a quite macam quiet person
jadi aku dalam class pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual
err tapi bila aku join takraw baru aku macam
uh jumpa orang-orang ni semua and
I was quite good at it ah sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw
and then the coach was the one that macam kira recruit aku
through my brothers ah dia dia nampak aku dia cakap eh join ah join ah takraw
then then uh aku join and then
and then err it was funny ah sebab aku was
coach aku pun macam confident aku boleh main
I think by primary four aku managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four aku the captain at junior team and then primary five aku captain of senior team
ya ya that's why dari situ aku macam belajar macam this leadership roles
macam macam mana nak uh
sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku ah kat sekolah
kalau aku tak buat homework pun dorang macam marah
primary school was fun lah cause of takraw I mean
sebab kalau kalau err
tapi depending on tekong kalau dia left hand ke ya
uh kadang-kadang
and then if the tekong is left legged then feeder nak kena belajar campak
atau striker
tapi aku lagi suka striker
takraw was fun lah tu tu pun macam mana aku macam
belajar ah the
sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk nationals
queenstown primary tak pernah dengar
tapi queenstown secondary ya
oh sebab aku rasa
okay aku remember primary five
against err since the first round kita
kita beat every school
the west zone okay so kita east zone err
uh school ada east north uh west dengan south
jadi kita dari east zone
jadi kita meet all these different schools yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita beat them ah
err using basics kita tak ada macam fancy fancy semua tapi coach kita ajar macam betul-betul master your basics
kita beat all these schools from
ya tapi aku
surprisingly national that time primary five kita beat dorang juga junyuan ya so kita macam kita ada this momentum ah which starting sampai finals kita tak kalah
uh menang qihua
second team kalah
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win ah untuk champions
so macam every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus ada nama ni semua but never tampines north primary school
a'ah sia aku nangis rabak sia tu
aku really felt the responsibility ah
sebab kita punya vice principal kat situ
but the tampines north tak pernah achieve this kind of achievement
wait delta league apa
think macam
so aku
abeh aku nampak that time kau post kat instagram macam
dorang still cakap apa boys become last at least
dorang shouldn't macam just celebrate because you get at least fourth macam dorang should celebrate the change you know
wah takde love life lah okay tinggal macam four minutes
aku attached
aku jumpa dia through
dia pergi cambodia
okay so total sec two that time ada macam
ya boleh click ah so
but that time sec three uh dia suka orang lain
ah tapi aku don't mind sebab
just find her pretty you know macam I can
oh ya aku okay then
relationship dia tak work out
ya you you you kinda like macam jauh
ah how was it mm boleh lah
boleh lah
like um boleh lah macam I didn't expect it to be hard as it is
it's more to macam satisfactory lah unexpectedly good
ya ya ya and then you macam mana
mm sama sama
mm ah understood understood ya cause uh macam for me kan like uh
I don't enjoy anything online at all from ah daripada lectures
really I cannot I feel like um like like very unproductive it's like err no no is is err don't even don't even get me started talking about it cause like really really really really malas
malas abeh ah tiring lagi so macam
abeh like um macam mana ah your exam punya like err format like how how was it like it's it's online right so macam like how how did it go
leceh ah leceh
oh for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that I had was like ah twenty four hours ah so I cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like huh forty eight hours lama gila
like the questions banyak ke like were there like a lot of questions
no difference tak ada tak ada difference
like why you using serious tak dengar
try ah cakap something
mm cause it sounds like uh err dia macam tak clear sangat so like try it's ya like I cannot really understand what you're saying ya
sangat what you trying to say ya
blur blur sikit
oh for me kan ah yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was ah twenty four hours tapi like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction tau like the instruction were like very specific so
eleven questions and then lepas tu um the eleven questions tu like ah the marks were different lah for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks ah so like um
ah for like for each question err um my lecturer specified ah like um berapa banyak words
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like um macam ah tak make tak make sense ah cause like err questions two marks jer atau three marks but like uh dia nak
dia nak um the words like limit dia like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
we had to like really um arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like um time consuming lah ah which explains why maybe she like kasi us twenty four hours untuk buat
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like tak tidur cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between ah but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
ya and then then nanti last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like err everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what um like for for me that the twenty four hours uh punya exam it was like macam
uh it was penat ah but then like
but then like uh how do I say this dia macam
my back crying for help and then ya and um like mata sakit and everything so macam err no it's not very like ya it's the worst ah I would say the whole the whole
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think boleh lepas
cause like you know you know there are times like um uh like I I attended like online lectures but then like macam like I was there but I was asleep
ya ya ya serious tak bedek
all okay cause I had this like um ah I ada kelas ni eight thirty tau eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your macam sleeping schedule semua all over the place kan like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late lepastu like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like uh um the what apa nama dia
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link ah I would join lepastu the minute I join and then like right ah terus I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think uh I bukan sorang cause ah when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like macam
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already um not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes ah apa lagi eh online like tak boleh oi
eh tapi lecturers you semua like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some macam trouble juga with certain lecturers
mm faham
most of my lecturers okay lah I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way kan macam if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's semua benda macam very baru untuk semua orang
I think everyone macam masih nak adapting to the whole new situations so it's like uh I I appreciate that uh lecturers I macam they were they were okay lah but then I did have macam trouble dengan some
lecturers ah cause like I don't know why ah tak tahu kenapa ah tapi like I ada satu lecturer ni she was like um
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why ah cause I've I I I don't err I don't macam I tak I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole um the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
um cause it's online kan abeh macam she doesn't
she expects us to err macam
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean faham lah we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so macam it wasn't helpful lah she was expecting us to only come to her only bila kita ada questions so it was like very hard for me like ah apa eh like macam cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just balik singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like macam apa tu the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
ah dia akan cakap ah apa tu
dia akan cakap okay this is the topic we're going to ah this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
on our own so macam I was like ah it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is lah to to understand to faham kan
I I understand that she she wants like kita nya level to be like of really university students tapi macam
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very leceh like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were macam banyak gila benda nak kena like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very leceh and then like
it was very leceh and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause uh uh I had to handle dengan all those um group members who are just useless
working team members which was hard lah cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like macam equally divided kan tapi like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like um malas ah want to layan like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress ah of it but you know some did some did not so it was like ah whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did dorang tak kesah then dorang punya pasal ah
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like ah whatever ah suka hati ah nak buat pape pun boleh lah ya like ya it's like
like apa tu
uh apa nama dia like you know like bila physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
um and then uh like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours ah similar to yours like dorang kasi kita choose um nak apa tu nak individual atau group work so it was like okay lah I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya I mean it's your own your own uh I mean it's kind of scary lah to do be doing assignments like individually tapi macam you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster I mean not faster faster but you know what I mean kan like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so macam settle lah senang kan habis cerita eh but serious I'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause I'm taking are you taking the summer semester
oh dah start dah
ya one class aje okay lah tu
same cause uh for me like I haven't I haven't started sebab mm I baru I baru jer register the class
cause today is a public holiday for malaysia merdeka kan
okay tak
oh pasal apa tu
oh jadi
oh jadi
mm or the like apa tu cerita dia like is it
orh cerita cerita dia like what the whole is it like series eh
series berapa season
I don't I tak suka ah tengok series
I I don't enjoy um like I don't know like maybe sebab macam it's either like I get bored easily atau macam I'm just hard to impress ah cause I will always ah sebab selalu kalau I tengok cerita kan nanti like like if macam dia series
nanti I nak tengok halfway jer
sometimes not even halfway I will just macam ee boring ah malas done dah that's it
especially kalau cerita dia romance kan oh lagi malas no no no tak boleh I I really
ya I macam I mean
sometimes you just you know ah macam just to
just enjoy macam for entertainment macam okay ah but then
ah I would just macam be like err a bit aje ah tapi nanti bila dah get too much nanti I macam ee tak nak tak nak I'm not watching this ah especially if
kalau macam cerita dia very predictive kan no predictive predictable kan so I macam err tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I will just be like okay my last then I'm just I'm gonna finish watching it at all just
move on sebab tu I prefer tengok movies ah daripada like watching like series or like sitcoms or whatever lah you call it
so I'll see lah eh I'll check out and see kalau I managed to watch a good place then I akan bilang you lah
tapi dah habis ke the series is it like done
oh really itu jer ke tak ada cerita lain yang you boleh suggest kat I
um cause uh I when I get like macam betul-betul bored and then I would watch K drama kira like K drama is like the last resort kalau betul-betul dah boring gila then I would watch K dramas
but on a normal like day with like a lot of other things to do no like I'm not the sort lah like macam
uh what I do is macam I would watch rental videos on youtube like really anything like really like suggested stuff right I would I will just watch it macam I picit and just tengok jer
ya I mean just like every like a really a lot of things there kan and macam for me ah macam get bored easily like videos paling lama pun um fifteen twenty minutes dah lah that's it
not like not like macam really lama-lama videos like orang berbual banyak-banyak no no I would just like watch random stuff
if I macam
sometimes I watch like like really random ah like I can be watching macam ah I'll be watching like cooking shows or ya to like macam make-up stuff
or like really like random stuff like people punya like macam room tours or something I don't know I just like really just anything ah
tak tahu ah I macam sometimes tak ada pape pun I will just like
tengok jer check jer it's just like see just see jer like I I'm I do I would I'm not really active lah in terms of like posting stuff ah but I'm very active just being online and like seeing like post by other people lah
not like really really must those people who really post like stories like every day and then like have those like really small dots on their stories tak ah I'm not like that just that I just like enjoy like watching stories of other people then like macam look at other people's posts and then stalk people
not really stalk but like macam look at their profiles and like you know random stuff like really random stuff
like macam
I don't know ah it's just very fun to like read people's like thoughts for me ah macam I really macam enjoy macam baca baca tengok
ya ya ya ya tapi like macam it just makes you like macam talk to yourself like macam eh
like eh interesting eh ah macam you know got those kind of things like is
which like macam I really like ya I mean I really respect those kind of people cause I'm I would say I orang dia I'm very I'm kind of very I very opinionated actually it's just that I don't really express it out openly
ya I mean ya I mean when I do I do ah but I don't do it like all the time like when I really have things to like really express it out I would tapi macam selalunya mm no that's why I really admire people who really can talk about things like especially macam
like you see when like people really like speak up on like uh like current issues like I I really really want to like I really wish I could macam kadang-kadang macam eh like ee I really like like at the back of my head kan macam there were like a lot of things tau I really want to say a lot of things but then like I macam oh like uh
ah uh ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish kadang-kadang I boleh just cakap jer tapi
I I feel that um my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like um follow up on what what's happening kan tapi like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really macam go out there and speak up about things like this ah
ya ya ya I mean like for me macam kadang-kadang like I feel I takut kat walaupun
my my twitter is like private like private account tapi
huh tapi I I I feel like macam like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited ah tapi you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
ya I mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words kan like you don't want to macam you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like um discussion like a healthy one lah like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like macam very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya I mean they are very receptive receptive they are very receptive ah so macam okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what I find very interesting about twitter ah
I mean I I find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to I would say macam go to newspaper ah
sometimes memang mm mm sometimes memang tired ah actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me tapi
penat ah baca dorang nya tweets
I think it's just how it is right you can't you can't get like semua orang to agree what you what you what you have to say it's just the fact that you know when you like express things out you have to like brace yourself for like you know back lashes and everything cause confirm have one
oh kalau instagram
tak ah tak tak honestly instagram not really cause like
I follow a lot of people but then like um I get tired of watching stories eventually so I will just like mm I will just like like exit lah when I macam dah malas want to tengok banyak-banyak but some some stories I do enjoy ah but others like when I feel like um macam ee malas pe nak tengok I will be just like
mm mm mm sebab yang the first few ones will always be the one that you always watch right for story ah so macam okay dah tengok ni semua okay dah that's it I don't have to look at everyone's ya cause some people um for me
I feel like I I as much as macam I respect orang lain punya way of using social media sometimes I rasa macam people exposed too much and I don't want to know faham ke
mm like I mean as much as like suka hati lah you nak buat apa dengan you punya instagram tapi sometimes know what they share sometimes buat me uncomfortable so macam I sometimes tak nak tengok ya so I macam okay ya ah
oh cute gila ya cause sometimes they will just like all the um macam celebrity punya anak kan they all like ee geram lah
geram they just really I don't know it's just geram lah
especially those ah I really ah I cannot tak boleh
have you been to like macam uh any weddings like since since phase two
is it yang young counsel eh
pergi dating
letters hantar surat jer
sorry apa
tapi hantar surat like not even
and then jap
dorang hantar surat jer
tak tak like even whatsapp ke I don't know ke like like they don't use like technology form punya like
it's letter right I mean letters macam take time kan untuk like untuk reach the recipients and it's like I mean I feel like dia macam you know orang dulu dulu punya way of like coupling
okay I mean okay ah I think for me right even if you want to keep things like quote unquote macam traditional kan I would at least use email lah you know
you know letters really take a very long time and it's like all the way to medina so macam wow for me I'm I'm very impatient person so macam
like kira macam you know it's like kira macam you have to really
tulis a lot of things you wanted to to really really update you know everything in like one letter then you have to send it all the way
I mean they they macam taking it taking it slow ah
right taking it slow faham faham
macam would you
would you like if macam let's say your parents nak matchmake you would you would you like be open to it
but then okay okay okay okay okay I mean look okay if you were to change the situation kan macam for example
since you cakap you ada someone already like kira you are seeing someone tapi like if you were to change like the whole situation for example um if you are done with your studies kan dah habis belajar then like you not dating anyone
alamak tapi nak cari dekat mana
for okay bila comes to like my love life right I I'm the type of person yang if we vibe we vibe ah so if like from the start if we can't really click then I don't think that that's like hope in it so I will just like you know what it's not it's not happening so ya so to be matchmake right mm I think for someone like me it's gonna be hard lah it's gonna be very hard
ah I lebih prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know lah like macam like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which macam I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so macam
so macam I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I tak sure ah whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like ah similar lah to your parents my parents tak macam gitu ah so ya
dorang macam ah cari sendiri they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
um I nak lah tapi you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about ah
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first lah then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like sekarang to have love life like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so um malas lah also like
mm cause like I had like previous like history with like bad breakups so it's like I really malas and tired want to like start again and to to meet someone new no I don't want
ya ya ya malas ah
I really don't want I just macam uh like I would
I would just like I like currently just enjoy that like the apa company of like my friends regardless of gender lah like whatever guy or girl just like enjoy it being friends mm but nothing beyond that I hope
do you have an aim like macam at like age apa umur berapa
I think everyone would think like macam they would get married like after their studies no like everything will be nicely like arranged but right now I'm like
cause like I think to just have degree is not enough so like I feel like I need to like um oh like what do I say how do I say this macam build up build myself up more in terms of education baru macam stable
to have like better jobs and everything kan to have like like a proper stable career then like then then can lah then boleh lah then can lah
dah dah lama kan tak berbual so macam it's really nice we should really jumpa soon you know
ah ah ah betul
so ini hari we will be talking about corona virus
err in Singapore and how so far kita kat sini at home and uh my family semua how we've been coping
err with all the jobs and all the um confinement semua kat rumah
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how I've been interacting dengan all my friends lah basically
bila we heard about all this um
corona virus thing err dulu back then I was somewhat employed lah
terus um when I heard about it at first err it didn't seem like such a big deal lah because um
people over there were quite err rilek they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
err maybe it won't be as such a big issue lah tapi after that when I came back um
I was given a couple of mask tapi I thought like okay lah not really necessary but err eventually it turns out that
so that time bila we saw it on the news err my my girlfriend's uh auntie lah so dia kasi
uh because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only macam ten masks or so something like this
habis um ask us to use it err when we are at the airport sebab err who knows kan especially Indonesia agaknya maybe
not so safe lah and then err so I flew back I still wear the mask uh at first I thought macam too much ah actually macam maybe
kat station pakai mask habis um some of them err they there was no form of social distancing ah back then so there was no such advice but
mask ada quite a number of people they were wearing it lah and then um they decided to
eventually err make an announcement on and said that dia punya mask ini semua actually not mandatory lah at first then cakap only kalau macam you sick err you stay at home
err just jaga yourself lah there's no need to go out um and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
um slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt banyak orang orang macam didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe err eventually um it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic lah habis Malaysia orang Malaysia affected orang Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to macam got on the list lah
ah so at first we were the first habis
err in Euro and then slowly got to America and now sekarang kan kita in a state where um
employed habis sekarang macam like looking for job because uh
how about your experience macam mana you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think siapa siapa anyone lah was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted banyak um even home based business at some point was err affected kan
uh that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less macam slammed her
ya but err because of what she said a lot of people macam tak satisfied lah diorang macam
um kena pulau rabak rabak lah basically because of her statement she even
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or niat dia the niat is there lah tapi macam
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good macam nak tolong all these regulation issue ah
tapi sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay lah I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
tapi because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is um what she should have done was
after she did it and of course nak return balik dia punya statement susah kan but at least macam just go out there and just apologize properly
tapi she chose to macam go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
and err some of them are funny macam the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend Hadi because okay to be fair sebab
habis he will macam ah be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants cuma bike is slightly different lah
like the first time I saw it macam this could be Hadi
it could really have been Hadi the way they dress dia punya seluar dengan dia punya helmet dia punya visor
uh unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but uh I think a lot of people macam does really
um macam it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite uh positive feedback ah about the guy dia super extra ah
and um while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large tapi macam it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say macam this guy this mat just naik motor habis just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that dia macam very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
err the first tak salah Deliveroo was to start all this tapi in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something lah
but what I really feel about food delivery is dia macam quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second ah about Grab drivers err not Grab drivers
people who are do food delivery all this kalau they really macam really work hard macam chiong all the way ah macam maybe eight hours chiong all the way macam Hadi for example kan
um they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on macam mana they hit dia punya incentive or macam mana they hit dia punya
um hours or dia punya right timing ah because all these riders kan macam dorang dah experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right kedai mana um
prepare food quickly kedai mana prepare food very slow they know how to play the game lah basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize macam your delivery ah
to the upper income group because macam especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery macam ya macam every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars uh or something ah per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people macam err  beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
no much prerequisite lah maybe if you macam nak deliver naik motor kan then
ah kena pakai lesen you have to prove your lesen lah but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview err macam documentary lah don't know on Grab and how err some of the handicap people
um they managed to get jobs in Grab macam dulu um when they before Grab kan macam there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say macam if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes tapi ada orang macam down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know macam is like a big macam beban
duduk kat rumah jadi beban jer puas hati macam you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this uh girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair lah
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver lah maybe satu hari deliver four or five items lah for example
so macam berdikari lah so instead of
the interface macam the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
err it it simplifies the task basically pergi sendiri pick up pergi sana drop off so it it it gives this
admin position or something macam kena interview tak tahu pass ke tak err your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless macam kalau too saturated or something lah there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
um the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how uh blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers punya salary
err I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate macam
you you don't get err you don't get denied err okay selalunya the idea is when you do the employment kan err you cannot be judged based on your I don't know err race or
so macam for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so err nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah so when you're tired you get home
so that so called keep them motivated lah whereas macam delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
and you don't have that burden of oh hari ini kena buat sepuluh delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
ah yes okay definitely lah so basically macam you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars err what you get
is um basically is through the app punya interface ah so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours lah
it's it's already a net amount dorang already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off err because sometimes
for example um whatever the food is dorang dah minus the food amount so err this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
terus err whatever is shown in your phone macam you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example ah that's yours lah basically
you are okay let's say you are riding habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan
oh tak ee I still got to go on I need to hit um ten deliveries today or uh I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
and how it is a good way for people macam let's say they have spare time ah macam let's say they work nine to five
habis malam macam they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then err just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
err ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus tapi sekarang dah starting so much on delivery
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to buku letak kat tepi
what sort of err security feature or identification yang dorang implement
kan risau
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already macam kirim salam ah
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle lah but you think that you are macam everything dah okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project kerja just to survive on the salary from that job
um but I kudos to you lah memang is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
or Facebook ada politics pe sekolah pun ada politics pe but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
in school walaupun you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever belajar but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that macam there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying macam nak enjoy susah
tapi okay it it depends on people right so um
two major popular universities that they went to is either or eh so macam sekolah so basically you study throughout the whole year
whereas for the one that I went to basically err buat project
err it it it becomes like what uh eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent kat belakang exam
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent tapi kalau you have macam ada solid group you can work with
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours ada project kan
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to macam all these budak budak they still have not have a taste of full life macam full working employment yet
that's why I think a lot of my friends yang um went to you uni SIM basically err university
night university lah so dia orang juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life ah there's no more social life basically
err pagi pagi daytime you go to work and then err malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time nak buat err nak buat group assignment nak study untuk exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
ya there's a lot of compromise err and you have to be willing to macam at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social lah because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
no lah at first to be honest ah at first bila all this thing happen kan macam um it's interesting err because is something novel
macam is not common apa dulu to to um communicate through okay maybe for you lah but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family tapi when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
err at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime uh kerja err in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward macam I think it depends on people also lah because ada orang ada orang boleh focus when they're at home
or the bed sleep lah take a nap during lunch time tu semua for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas kalau macam kat tempat kerja you've got to drag your ass and then
they switch into mode you know macam home mode err duduk kat rumah macam
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing punya mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is macam all wax style and then
ah you know you're wearing clothes um and then you go out and eh you you just have that vibe macam I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know macam when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in um I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in dia punya scheduling and stuff like that tapi
macam dekat rumah you can just eat macam you can snack and all that shit err but kalau kat luar uh macam you need to walk for it and uh I don't know
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you err do delivery uh I think the so called delivery fee is about macam four dollars something like this kan
and you can actually see they have macam those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package tak salah is err
no it's like a pass lah it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's apa macam limited edition kan tapi it's actually has been around for awhile
oh well people still deliver food a lot of people still macam still work from home pe banyak orang work from home pe sekarang lah
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while sampai sekarang
fishy ah the Russian punya vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three what
entah eh
entah lah
well kalau at the end of this year dapat pergi dapat pergi Malaysia pun I'm quite happy already to be honest
all the other countries at least dapat pergi somewhere within their own country kan so Malaysia even Malaysia or Indonesia
even though their borders are closed at least boleh pergi Penang dapat pergi um I don't know
for one of the islands Perhentian islands or something you know Sentosa nak pergi Sentosa Sentosa ada apa kau dah kenapa
if itu bukan itu bukan dia ini tau is not like dia pergi by himself dia pergi ikut err the diving punya tour thing
you still can go pulau hantu now actually
now that I got all this part time job at least macam my sleeping schedule is a bit better
tidak before that I was sleeping macam pukul lima pukul
empat it was ugh didn't like it is too late I forever young what you talking about man I'm you're only as old
tapi it's not like exclusive for
thirty more seconds kita kena clap eh lepas ini or
habis just stop jer
okay tak apa tak apa tak apa uh it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now
okay boleh dengar
kalau tidak nanti it becomes distorted
okay okay then aku adjust
the boundary ah okay aku baru pasang
okay lah aku tak buat salah ah macam I I don't see
I wouldn't penalize myself uh just now ah maybe yesterday okay lah because yesterday aku macam kaku sikit because I didn't ride for very long right
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to lah but aku dah datang lambat semalam
semalam aku tak lambat so
then he started the face like macam
tahu macam oren penyet punya kan looking not happy like that so I was like okay lah I tell him I said okay I got experience like that uh uh kau experience kat mana aku cakap dulu I oh okay somebody go ask sampai back berapa then like uh
empat ke lima ah after second assessment
oh okay okay this one not for you go that one dia cakap macam tu
and obviously I I kept stalling like I um not midway but I kept stalling at that place yang you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so dia macam when I'm moving then dia stall stall stall gitu
I don't see anything wrong with it lah macam they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that aku bawa maybe thirty five ah thirty or thirty five ah it break dia punya speed ah
so the the problem was uh okay that that was yesterday so aku faham
I made less than less than ten rounds ah it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was um dia cakap okay uh he put two people out
tak nak lah
fact ni cakap I didn't even stall today macam because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice kepala otak dia lah need more practice at least you come and tell me macam maybe I did something wrong maybe aku terlalu laju or aku macam maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know ini macam guessing game you know or not like oh I asked him I asked me just now I said oh actually what what went wrong like
wah tadi kau okay uh everything okay breaking okay tak macam semalam cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
oh takde apa-apa kau just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking kepala otak kau kau pun every prac kau pegang motor ke sama juga kan it's the same it's the same model what it's the same bike what what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated lah at that point of time then I just ah ya you know sudah lah
but tapi dia punya failure aku faham because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really tergolek you know rabak ah
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about ah okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not yang belakang yang that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan admin punya side
time belok
dia turning ah ada cornering ah so
I was in front of her so aku bawa okay everything semua okay so I already made one round already
and then the instructor pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror lah but I won't speeding I won't because that part memang you have to go down to get to that turn what
then aku belok sekali ada eh
because the other places where you turn ada orang it's quite open but that particular corner is is is ha memang seclude you cannot see anything there ah
ha then the instructor was like uh apa kau buat lagi alamak dia cakap macam tu kan then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop ah stop and wait
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left memang tak boleh lah of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you ah I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that ah so I guess takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say eh sorry eh kalau in your way I say nevermind it's okay lah you just
just do your thing ah then the instructor go and tell her some more you know ha masa dah buang ni lagi
she likes to macam himpit to the left side
so no she probably got so close and after that she gabra because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
ha badan dia pula was on the other lane
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia
and then after that uh she was trying to start the bike ah kelakar cause when she fell kan I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then apa she said eh uh I think my motorbike spoiled dia cakap macam tu and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled dia ingat spoiled dia try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik one you cannot hear the engine starting ah
alamak how ni eh gini gini gini then he go there he said this one your switch your switch ha check your switch okay
then dia begin
takpe uh number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake takpe takpe takpe I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one ah so after that sampai habis
so I was just riding and riding and riding macam no problem lah to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one yang pakai bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying ah tall guy malay
muka dia macam mat sial sikit dia dia was on the he was on the he was at the bend yang depan lagi before you turn back into the the the admin area dia jatuh part sini kira square
macam ni kan admin area kat sini kan dia ada tempat sini si instructor lagi satu dia lepak sini the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed kau nak brake buat apa you're already breaking already what I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
macam you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice ah turn and like salah salah kau kena brake lagi kau kena brake lagi brake brake sebelum kau down gear brake kau nak brake apa lah siol so
at that point of time the more he talk the more aku peng ah but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three tudung girls in his class
tapi dia orang baru nak keluar ah so
aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa ah just want to start one again ya I guess normal leh you know whatever lah eh
for me lah as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong dia suruh aku main one two one two one two three aku one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
ha plank plank quite senang what
but I still remember two B in seven seconds tak salah aku is fast lah let me class to you have to go thanks again eh
ya I saw I saw it uh tak salah aku nampak dekat mana eh
you don't upgrade now lah dol you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten ke something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once kau dah
confident once kau rasa macam you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike ha that is five six years later you you change ah you don't have to macam oh I get class two sekarang juga aku nak tukar ha
but ya um then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the lampu
four bottles mampus mampus
ya lah because you got to change it frequently apa
have what ah three ten is is pendek what
but you can lower the expansion you the zontes three ten can lower down the expansion yes but zontes three ten cantik sia
the yang one ninety
the the the the apa the capacity capacity I think is
dia punya tank eh dia punya tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
ya but the thing is a zontes kalau let's say misal kata if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike mampus ke apa ke kat sana bro I'm dead sia
that's why you never go jauh-jauh I mean you went to malacca once right
ya lah you common bike boleh ah you you use all this kind of funny sounding bike even continental yang tak kira asia tak popular punya mampus kalau motor kau mati
oh kira macam gitu siala
habis ah
malaysia boleh
but imagine if you're like stuck in I don't know negeri sembilan ke apa
kena jaga ah
aiyo kena bully ah
but if you tolak means kena bawa perlahan ah very slow ah
sticky situation macam mana
no but kau boleh brake juga apa
dulu punya trend eagle apa ha
wobbly ah lepas tu jatuh ah
kira dia orang semua members ah
time tu your father belum kahwin ah
masih bujang lapuk ah
tapi it's just dangerous sia
oh ya ya ya I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard belum lagi after
speaking of of of of this part tadi um
there was this guy I don't know I got tell you or not tadi ada satu he was on the mini circuit ah
a'ah sia basically the bike is is basically the the the wall like this but he went up and then he was still he was still turning bro on the bike whack everything first kena the plastic barrier after that ah already dah ada bunyi like gitu broom gitu then after that

aku tak tahu but after that he stop kaki dia sakit
here he cannot climb between after when he when he so called fell the bike was lying on him he bike was lying on him and he was sandwiched between the bike and the wall then dia macam I cannot ah I cannot
aku macam alamak
then the instructor the instructor just like eh nevermind you all continue continue macam tak apa-apa gitu nevermind nevermind you all continue and then he go he he came out lah to pull the bike one side then ask him you okay or not but I think after that he didn't didn't continue
I do not know but I I know dia cakap pasal after that's he walk he was limping
sakit juga siol sakit juga
but I really do not know no young ah maybe hazriq punya size ah

okay so technically we have a lot of jin kan it's a
but ya okay so kan but aku tengok video dia macam kelakar a bit lah but then
err okay aku skip to first part eh and then when so he he took this err a pair of shoes
cause this house was I don't know macam terbakar last time so ada ashes and there was something and then
so maybe the owner ada perempuan and ada a pair of shoes so this person this blogger took that pair of shoes and then put in front of the door
rumah rumah cina I guess
abeh uh huh
the the shoes is the direction is towards a door okay in front of the door so kira the pointy part of the shoes is towards the door lah kan facing the door
then so he go down you know just checking out buat kelakar cause he was scared so he sing along lah
tak handsome ah
mana ada kucing okay lah maybe maybe for us it's like ah he must have edited that lah ha
ya tu kau boleh cakap macam oo who's the one who change the direction okay so so he continued exploring the house
and then err apa
ya cause memang nampak terbakar
tak tahu ah eh
oh okay and then bila macam dia masuk
I think masuk bathroom or kitchen ah I forgot
and then suddenly like tempat tu very panas you know then dia punya tahap panas until there's a smoke come out of nowhere
dia punya fire spark and then tiba-tiba spread all the way dekat lantai so pasal kau human kan kau akan lari apa and then his live was being cut off oh he was doing live ah actually YouTube live
mm ah so he went out the house or room I don't know then dia try to put off the fire back
tak dapat semua ah only sixty percent
yang kat lantai lantai dia uh hilang kan
then bila dia
he saw the thing on fire no the room suddenly sampai
ya you remember that I said the object was like ada smoke coming out
no cause it was during circuit breaker apa
circuit breaker then ramai orang work from home so I was alone in the lab no interns no what
your tempat tinggal
dekat ah satu bus jer kot
apa tu naik one six eight jer
no dia naik one six eight then dia turun dekat jalan kayu kan
mana tahu so it's like a a palm thing sized eh
he kerja malam
kalau aku aku dah keluar seh
kurang ajar seh orang macam gitu ee
tak mahu hidup please
orang tengah kesusahan kau tak tolong eh
kurang ajar sia
today malam ah
is for orang yang buat korban kan not us
perempuan I'm not sure usually lelaki
I mean kalau kau baligh I guess I don't know
kau import
I think they will but restricted takde viewers viewers eh whatever ah ah ah ya ya
go masjid doesn't mean I always do korban what you think I'm that rich ah
no lah aiyo I don't even eat kambing
no ah only eat biryani and tulang merah
that's the only kambing that I eat
actually pada aku tak ah it depends on how you cook actually
no that's why aku very selective with like orang masak kambing kan aku tengok reviews dulu
err so far aku rasa biryani masjid jer yang sedap
you know yang yang kat sekolah kita yes tu from one of the mosques ah I don't know
it's like for four people to eat it in fact sikit jer cause they say girls always waste food
I mean don't blame us ah we finished it clean seh kita minta dua tiga kali
tu pasal seh
eh you are still growing takpe lah
I don't know korang kira the the high ah
tapi kau pernah pakai yang very tall what
ah yang penting aku tak kan
aku pernah pakai flats uh fifty which is what five no wait to
so perempuan eh
uh eh five tinggi tau
kau pernah pakai that time
siapa eh siapa nama dia fatin fatin nadirah
ah tu semua takde
no lah cause sec one aku tahu
then semua orang macam tak nak join dorang punya group so thirteen me cause I was unhappy with mumtaz then I asked my friends cause they were closer with me actually
then I kept eh you all want to join me kita book kita sewa bus then macam okay okay ah okay lor
aku ingat lah kau ni sec one sec one sec one aku ingat
no they were with dorang ah
ya I mean you keep blaming when like kita orang not everyone you know there's only like a group of people yang cari pasal dengan kau
actually understandable ah cause we were talking about class there what tak nak kawan macam
ah macam tersisih gitu
okay dah eh dah habis eh
but kena force take everything back
I don't want to take private okay aku tak nak stereotype ah but you look at the people who take private O level
tebalkan muka ah
and apparently I I was the only one yang retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back malu I guess so ya lah tapi ustazah siapa masniah tak salah
ah dia kata dengan aku apa kalau awak nak retake awak kena ambil fully dengan arab arab sekali semua aku macam eh serious ah ustazah
aku ah aku dah penat aku nak O level jer tau
previous seniors ah like they retake tapi they are exempted from

yo how how does it feel when you just broke up and then like eh kau tahu dia macam gini kat aku kat aku macam ya allah
sec two sec three ah but like after dia ni pe
kata-kata dia macam he was very depressed after breaking up with me like bullshit lah
like clearly everyone the whole school is talking about you you know like eh sudah lah I don't have time for all of you
eh tak cause okay cause my relationship was low-key relationship kan of course ah I don't want to expelled what
no maksud aku at that moment
that's different maksud aku low-key is like
ya okay maksud aku low-key kan that time was like cikgu-cikgu tak tahu part ni tak keluar tak heboh-heboh
so actually tak ramai orang tahu that I was in a relationship with him we study ah whenever we sit in the circle you know ah our our own things sit in circle then talk about then like eh amin like shafwa is it amin like shafwa right eh but I know shafwa like amin ah they always go out together aku dah macam
camne nak cakap eh aku jer asyik put in effort ah for me lah that's what I see ah don't know about him maybe he said like I put in effort too then macam ya lah

um and eh nak join tak muay thai gym together
everyday you pergi
no limitation and there's going to be like macam coach
um they are gonna be there macam ada certain slots certain coaches ah
tak tu tu lah soalan cepumas dia saya tak tahu boleh ke tak tapi kita cuba kita tak tahu
if you know how to might manage your time macam okay one day badminton then one day
gini but evolve is just
I usually run um macam about
kind of everyday but just like weekends kadang-kadang macam rest penat sangat kan
two K two K plus pun jadi seh
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know dekat um
kasi lah you know chance sikit kan tutup mata satu kan and just orh come
without any experiences in training will be provided kan boleh pe and
training apa internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much ah honestly
kan susah nak dapat company yang you know really
like baca buku about homework
so like you're contradicting yourself macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline macam tak kisah dorang buat apa but then
there was oh kena buat assessments lah apa lah
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused yang budak-budak ni kesian kan dah balik sekolah penat
talk at all you masuk bilik
start belajar
and tak boleh baca buku
sampai habis assessment book
for their well-being macam okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them macam shelter but
okay lah kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu
nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh tau
kalau rest pun ten minute
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high ah maybe because of that you know kids complain macam eh penat you know I don't want to go student care anymore
quitting lah actually like one month macam about seven
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit macam you know sit like
they fold their legs fold pun tak boleh
yes they have to sit macam you know upright sit properly
you know our own choices macam budak-budak ni like kesian kan semua benda kena
so dapat dapat jumpa dia sekejap dapat dapat ubat rindu you know you know
she dah dah dah dah dah ada suami so lupa lah
tak telephone tak apa
dapat and okay kahwin and like
dan you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
jodoh semua ni susah lah I mean like but
the day I get to eat some nasi biryani
nasi minyak please come on bila ni
macam like I don't know I I will learn from it lah
macam they will get like a set of rules
macam it's kind of unfair
macam takut tau okay you know like they say macam when you
when you buy buang air kecil kan then like there's ends
how to say macam
in my family punya history
ada okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my grandpa macam semua ada this history of
don't you takut seh say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
takut lah I mean like I have to take care of my diet lah
so I am like oh okay jap white bread is high
okay macam
insulin tak pakai banyak even insulin is working perfectly
that's the thing kuah lemak apa ah cholesterol oh my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
dekat kedai ada ke jual salad like hawker centre
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce kita beli like ten dollar but then
that's true beli like banyak then after that simpan in the fridge
this is the thing ah macam
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition nak physically active lah abeh busy lah dengan kerja
nutritionist exist to macam lead them
itu semua pakai duit seh do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
err love pun susah dapat like
that's true and parents nowadays also working abeh balik dah tidur you know that kind of thing
and ya lah it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend gi mana
we lepak dengan kawan but I mean it's not wrong but okay lah macam
ada balance lah okay one day with your parents one day oh I've heard of this story before satu okay there's this one um student right
um makcik tinggalkan
ah abandoned him dekat bus stop dekat malaysia
ah dia tinggalkan ah dia letak bag suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa ah
cakap um bapa nak balik you know that kind of thing and the son also tak cari bapa dia for one month
and nampak bapa dia dekat old folks home
ya that's true macam you know
maybe the financially dorang tak boleh handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays banyak macam drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in macam oh ni ya allah tak baik seh
the kids now the kids ada sekarang trauma issues
ya lah they've taken care of me well apa kecil-kecil kasi makan this a way for us to repay back
that's true macam it it
um doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia punya chances
um lepak or relaxing at her old age
bosan seh duduk dekat rumah you know like the whole thing like
I don't know macam singapore
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only ni semua nak merebut lah but then
you know if you really want to chill chill mango pergi dekat paris
just duduk minum kopi and you
ada pros and cons juga fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent macam economy wah jangan cakap ah
lepak sikit lah
you know the population pun sekarang macam a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
I mean rezeki tu okay lah there's rezeki tu datang dari very you know
makan pun berapa dah berapa dollar okay nak beli pampers nak beli ini and
to me macam house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid lah I've never been living with a maid before macam sedap kan ada orang kemaskan you and all that
go macam okay err go with the flow macam go with the flow sangat you know
okay to me macam one year gap is quite productive leh like you just take one year to just
momentum dah hilang tau hilang graduate
abeh dah tak belajar eh
macam shiok dah naik shiok
so macam if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
may I I graduated kirakan macam april lah eh dah habiskan
till november terus start kerja
so better lah aim for it and there's a lot of my friends yang
the punya
so minor I mean you can minor in apa organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
oh betul betul betul
I mean depends ah on the situation kalau nak job hop just because oh you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not macam you're still young you need to know what you really want in life kalau tak experience macam mana seh
progress betul-betul macam you know be successful
oh my god that is ridiculous okay merepek gila
macam we are barely okay
like with so many macam experience and really capable
takkan nak sama okay over generous everyone as the same
don't over expect too much and also don't macam
you know like letak kita kat bawah sangat you know macam
dorang macam eh korang ni tak ada apa-apa ah just nothing you know
middle lah macam
that's true macam like
I always watch like movies you know macam
and macam susah lah dapat
macam america ni semua
sometimes I do have thoughts macam if we want to be like
apa ni is stranger things
a decent self control punya tolerance but me
like once I'm indulge into that kan habis
it's over for me so I tend I tend to macam you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like muay thai gym
for I usually waste money on play nation ni semua
tapi waste of money lah so I stop playing games
switch is simple kau macam you can bring it around pastu boleh main
baju ni semua but I'm trying my best not to
I see eh wait where does he where macam mana dia invest
tak sikit kan that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just kasi macam hundred seventy gitu
and for fifteen years ah then macam ada you will get back like a lump sum
um and in case if you were to macam touch wood lah macam pass away or anything like
how to get ah macam
you know these thing which are the backup plan gitu
what do you mean by anak luar nikah
oh tak tak tak macam serious macam in love gitu abeh uh dorang macam eh aku nak kahwin ngan kau ah because like I know I feel like I'm ready for this marriage abeh like um you know the
the parents macam oh you too young you know why why you want to get married so young you know and then they are like no I want to get married now now now what do you think
haram lah like that
okay so it's like err kes macam err okay scenario ah it's like err
they halalkan like that ah
macam apa mm macam nak date other chicks or what
I think I think by the fourth year ah aku dah settle down sia aku dah macam damn this is long and it seems like much of a long shot see
but but to me ah by the third or fourth year ah it will give me like a sense of macam
ah that's the thing lah because of the current situation right like right now we are both schooling abeh tak stable so even if we wanted to tie the knot kita masih takde
like tak ready because of money ya
tu lah
tapi honestly speaking my parents are like scared because like we are okay both I think I can understand from both parents point of view because they like err
they don't want both of us to macam sekolah halfway sekolah halfway then after that err drop out because what pregnancy or we need money to to support ah to support each other or like err
I don't want to commit anymore sins eh and it's not that err macam bukan aku yang tanggung fully tau is like my parents around who has to tanggung for my sins also so it's like aiya I don't know lah susah I don't mind getting married now
macam I think it's kind of true you know I have a lot of
err friends yang macam ah don't want ah I I need money I need money like err aku takde duit nanti tak boleh hidup and I'm like but money is not everything what you know there there is a lot of things that accumulates to life you know ah macam entah
macam kalau kau tak ada duit kau macam hancur ah
like nobody was rushing for everything traffic was normal tak takde orang yang macam marah marah you know kat singapore macam
semua orang nak boom boom boom rush rush rush even in public transport especially in public transport semua orang macam oh alamak aku kena masuk
entah when I was still
correct eh okay lah jam is another thing in singapore because we're so small ambil macam the I don't know in singapore is so dense the popular the popular apa the population ah yes is so dense and like there's this
actually a lot of people want to err masuk singapore you know to because singapore is safe in terms of the health and all that and kita macam number one tau tip top tau
like my dad boss they actually when COVID started in singapore right they flew to spain and then after that bila spain kena dia cepat cepat balik ke singapore
macam kalau kau sakit ke apa kan ada disease siapa kau tak tahu apa-apa kau datang singapore singapore can like handle it you know
donation like that okay and then like err a lot of children from asia kind of thing dorang macam err
suburbs is like farm area macam all the rural ah ah ah like rural area like people
I remember dekat punggol macam everything must empty takde barang you know there was a a lot of land yang kita boleh pakai
and then kita macam
you know last time I err we go pancing tau
pancing dekat macam illegal places
eh aku pancing lah
err how to say ah macam hutan-hutan oh begitu kita pergi kita drive dengan kereta masuk hutan mana entah random
serious tak joke ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni confirm dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik confirm tahu punya
so err I think kita pancing ah but then after that I think the government know about it lah so no choice right err they I think they close macam a lot of the places ah and then err kita the only place kita boleh pergi is
flats because population kita kan makin besar
kita ah foreigners also coming in a lot of foreign talent
then err apa singapore pun is a district for business tau kau tahu like a lot of people come here to make deals and like because it's a common ground macam
si kim jong-un datang kat singapore dengan si donald tu kan dorang datang ke sini cause we are neutral
ah aku ingat aku ingat the apa banyak macam sibuk kat shangri-la tapi semua orang macam ee I want to see liao ah that kind of thing
eh singapore ambil kesempatan eh but it's good err apanya rasa publicity
ya it was good publicity for us ya sebab wah terus semua orang macam wah tengok oi singapore lawanya shangri-la wah macam semua nak pergi kan
tapi err I err aku rasa ramai orang ada misconception especially after rich crazy apa
eh I think after that that one right so many people macam got to know about singapore kan because they mentioned in singapore banyak kali tu
but the funny thing was apparently there are rumours yang cakap rumah tu bukan kat singapore
rumah tu some of it was filmed in malaysia
okay aku tak pernah tengok sorry ah
serious no joke aku tak pernah tengok
I don't know I felt like it was just too hard cam am I right macam and it's
phua chu kang yang adik
oh betul
kan rambutnya poof
okay K K salah salah
I thought they were itu
dia memang jelaka ke dia every movie pun dia jelaka
ocean eight one is jelaka
he cute I got see him before as in like I mean like nak
alamak takde chance lah
banyak okay K
that time aku kat rumah abah aku then he say uh he ask me ah eh do you want to watch mulan or not then I say
but people say don't support mulan then but then I do want to watch lah macam
tapi I want to see if the cinematic is good or not so
so aku macam okay ah maybe just watch but I didn't really pay attention to it ah
I was not fully there but I watch macam sepuluh minit lepas tu chao
and then after that I came back I oh okay so this is the scene ah ah ah oh ni scene dia abeh apa dah jadi uh oh ya so I didn't really focus but I kind of know macam dia punya jalan cerita
ya why kau dah tengok oo on the cinema
oh apa dragon tu mushu eh
aku sedih bila mushu takde because that was that played a very important role you seh
alamak aku tak ingat [ah]
tapi it changes everything seh like the jalan cerita is not there anymore what
I remember seeing that one the the guys macam fooling around mandi
the mandi part I saw that one
ketawa sial like apa jer K but anyway then aku ingat bila
cause yang lagu dia it keeps playing that's all everytime I watch the music keep playing sia then I was like what is this leh why why the like in the real cartoon got so many songs you know everybody's happy
but then this one it's like keep playing reflection reflection reflection sini reflection sana abeh
alamak ku tak dengar
speaking of movies when was the last time you pergi cinema
kita pergi tengok cerita alamak I forget what was the movie called err
it was like err X-men punya series ah
ya macam this group of kids with super mutants ah new mutants ya
ajak aku then K lah
eh aku tengok ah sia
tak semua ah aku tahu the first one
no not the first one lah the first one is normal apa yang dorang
ah apocalypse aku tengok
back to the future dah aku tengok
aku tahu yang err
err yang the first one the first one ya normal kan the second one is the dorang balik right flashback kan the third one is
ah ah si jean tu
mm wolverine tiga ah tiga
bila semua cinema semua busak busak pula buka bila cinema buka
baru err it was one of the movies that was being released together
takde lah when no lah after COVID bah
eh after COVID eh macam COVID dah habis juga
the there's the scooby doo new movie yang macam merepek ah honestly
eh tapi yang the one that I was the the one I was so disappointed eh was a quiet place
aku macam siala
sakit hati tak dapat tengok it's not released
ya abeh dorang semua orang dah get ready ah I think it was
aku dengar bila but it was going to be released
sekali when the government announce yang the circuit breaker period kan lepas tu dorang macam sorry cancel lah ni semua ni semua and it was like a couple of weeks maybe two or three weeks
aku sedih sia I was like walao so close
tapi boring ah bila kat cinema we were separated see and we were three people
so I was like macam mana ni then kita okay lah terpaksa lah I just ask uh apa
I mean like it's okay what I just because I also don't have any interest right in this movie sorry sorry apa
okay maju cari online ah
macam okay they needed this staff to jaga the cinema halls and they needed this staff to save entry then they needed counter staff
but now they change seh they change to err counter err satu orang so the counter will take all your orders macam kau nak tiket ni you want some drinks okay uh when you pay already there's this like queueing system macam McDonald's
so apa ni
so kita tunggu lah macam McDonald's begitu
even at Timezone tu kali aku pergi
ya aku pergi Timezone
eh Timezone bes seh but anyway I went to Timezone also
ya true makan duit a lot
uh same lah like they just kesian aku tengok a lot of people do a lot work seh then macam to me it's extra work ah
oof kenapa pula
ya sia eh speaking about that and plus even if you commit such crime like that if you get caught lagi like
but ya lah I I think you brought up a good point seh like I think this second job that okay maybe if it's a side hustle yang tak take so much of your time ah then maybe can ah
macam what
like eh walao I'll be angry seh if I have no social life boleh mati sia
oi susah sia
okay the time or money eh okay kalau if let's say I am married lah
ah that's why that's why I say money is tak not so bad ah it can be a choice ah
I think being in singapore macam very I think just singapore lah ya
keeping it to macam singapore punya contexts ah
oh tu lagi ugh
although I have to say that macam uh
like that one that one can say that the government is trying to improve because err there are more ministers talking about it and macam a lot of people are more open to listening and like they don't just macam categorising as orang gila you know that kind of thing
that one rabak seh semua orang macam ah ni confirm stress jer
tak mau sensitive seh ya tapi ya lah err I think it's
have you heard of this macam disorder called multiple multiple
apa I forgot ah split personality gitu macam
gitu split is the one ya kau pernah dengar
aku pun tak tahu sia
uh okay I had actually aku tengok this YouTube video tau err this this there's this girl lah aku tak tahu ah
err then dia macam tunjuk tau macam mana dia punya
disorder macam dia punya err how like she just teach more about her itu [ah] her her macam mental health I guess
you know it's not mental health is just the disorder lah eh dia punya diagnosis ya
and then dia tunjuk tau macam mana like she changes from one person to another person that kind of thing
wow I didn't know such like wah seriously macam ee aku tak pernah nampak sial gini ya because of internet ah ya basically things from the internet eh macam exposure seh
ah ah macam recommended
yes that's the okay honestly when aku first heard of it eh I was like
what ya ya eh apa sial this is this seriously macam for real I've never heard of this sia
and I was so shocked by the err apa personalities that was in that girl you know
okay dengarnya ni alters
ya tak betul not not really tak betul but macam split kan macam banyak power
okay they will get strong tiba-tiba all that right
ah tapi tapi dia ceritakan as much as it is an exposure to this disorder it also portrays a little bit uh macam fictional of the disorder macam bilik
so ya you should watch it you know ah that girl I forget I know her YouTube is dissociate did or something like that kau tahu anthony padilla the YouTuber
anthony padilla ada ah kat YouTube ah then he he did that the interview
ya then uh he interview ah the girl then the girl show got this budak kecil inside her body eh ya then budak tu kecil tu keluar tau
as each alter has their own um role macam there's the protector
ah there's the protector there's a apa mediator there's the child and all that so
aku tak tengok movie dia actually
tapi aku tahu pasal movie dia
macam err like like those scars lah like that
macam superhero right right right they had a motive right together
uh I feel like uh apa ni the movie is good exposure lah
eh I mean is rare to to see all these kind of people like I've never met somebody in singapore ah actually tak pernah aku nampak dorang macam begini ya
all right okay jadi yang abang guide to grabfood ni

so for physical classes macam dia orang kasih berapa orang datang
stamina dah turun
rentak and all
I guess I guess that's the stereotype lah kalau macam malay dance instructor confirm zumba
you lose our pintu tak ada lah
then pakai lagu-lagu seventeen seventeen is known for their very sharp um dances
it's ayam juga
ah it's okay sis dah malam kan dah pukul sembilan fifty fifty
oh my god aku ingat kau dah ada dua phone ni I'm a businesswoman ke
how okay in the first place macam mana kau nak focus I I'm I just
you know what I mean ya to each it's own I trust you I know like if you say suara sedap mesti suara sedap kan
ha tu lah I thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff anime you probably won't go the other way
um it's more slice of life I guess um so I guess I prefer that kind rather than macam like actually the things I remember watching
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so macam for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers kalau dia tak pakai kan nanti dia bangun pagi kan terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like urut me like he would urut and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
it's so merepek but it's so good it's so kelakar gila like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
okay yes yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch ah saiki it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I rasa belum habis
like I've started two three weeks ago I rasa belum habis
I watch I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time tak habis-habis tau I'm like bila ni
aku tak tahu ada berapa season berapa banyak episode I'm still with season two tau season freaking two
oh yang total aku tak tahu aku belum I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that lah cause I guess I can relate to it more macam shonen is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
even this one tak masuk akal pun at least I I can relate
I I actually um because I brought home najhah's punya um haikyu jacket and
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite berisi juga like she's not stick thin
plus it's like her favourite show so I tak nak hampakan lah
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like oh my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask kak zan and kak najhah you jangan macam gini eh
some how are some people are just really ridiculous tau merepek gila tau dia punya perangai and then after awhile I realized that for
ha tu lah
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like eh sixteen where you want to find online macam mana cannot because it's sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the thirteen one
jesse mccartney no lah that's a singer merepek jer sampai jer kutuk aku bukan
tu lah uh tak boleh haram
ah biasa okay lah bagus lah apa apa lah shah
ah tu lah oh my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like tunduk to the husband
you should just have said tiga so
kau datang dari drama mana ni
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched nur
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this um new ustaz baru graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
who has his own um tahfiz school and his own masjid
and then one day while he was giving the ceramah subuh thank god he he
kat masjid dia orang and then he received like some questions of people um and it's really weird because
ha dia orang Q&A tak pernah dengar kan
ada Q&A session uh the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version masjid version
bila keluar masjid then dia nampak this kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis on a white piece of paper
he was macam ya like wow
so but like more in depth lah so like for him like want to provoking macam hati dia macam dup dup
uh kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni
everywhere like dia punya dekat jalan and they met and they dated
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she tergesa-gesa but the she just
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's tak masuk akal the level of patients and the
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was cinta si wedding planner
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then kat rumah and she's about to sleep and she's wearing tudung
or she's sleeping in her tudung
or like maybe not the not the you know the nenek-nenek kind
ha tu lah
coffee apa starbucks
cause kita dekat dengan bugis kan kita boleh pergi haji lane like haji lane okay for example yang macam kalau kau nak makan makanan melayu semua
macam zamzam ada ataupun err ah ramen stall dim sum place also that time I went ramen stall quite nice ah
sedap sia nak try ya it's apa tu okay lah
I feel like kita reserve reservation punya tempat jer ah through online aku buat
orh then kau last minute rush ah
yang tadi kau punya kawan semua ah okay
uh huh eh how come orh it's the presentation eh tadi but how come your works kena collected
mm ya correct correct correct ya you make the final uh apa tu big change ah
because like kau fikir banyak sangat then after that like at the end of the day you know macam this thing happen like you tak expect what
you know sometimes you expect it to be very bad right but then sometimes like you won't know pada kau because you see that artwork everyday the lecturers see it like oh dia macam it's their first time seeing it ah so they will either like it or not like it ah so if it if they like it means it's good lah
apa tu what they say about your works semua like during the presentation
no fine arts ah aku lain kan mm uh huh
mm orh maybe macam I feel like the concept doesn't really
entah eh
kau punya asal like okay kau lecturer berapa banyak dalam presentation room
fever and dengue dia rabak eh chronic eh but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct oh okay so only one presentation ah bagus sia
aku dua presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself macam tiga lecturer yang kita ada
and then like uh week sixteen is another lecture that we tak kenal ya so it's like uh brand new face that see macam because our lecturer ya correct correct
cause that lecturer kita kan everyday nampak kan so like they bring this another lecturer then from there terus but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like err that one I can say uh make or break ah
ya but the adjunct lecturers semua baik gila ya
pe processor ya entah lah that what name ya
cause last sem really it's rabak eh and I feel ya entah maybe because pasal like
entah eh I feel like last year was their year macam shu dengan like eden I feel like this year it's like me and effy punya ya their they are so rabak oi ah ya last term last term
mm honestly aku
mmhmm orh it's your own major right ya ya kita every sem tukar kelas ya but fuck
because like honestly I thought this sem kita akan tukar kelas lagi but then me and effy macam alamak kita geram gila ah
you know we still in the same class tapi macam okay how it goes right that
sama class so everyone in sama class ah so basically its like monday tuesday is kita punya satu module jer kita ada for this sem for next coming sem ah satu module jer but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
kirakan major ah like what we want
macam we have macam performance installation we got ya ya we got a lot ah performing arts then we have
apa tu packaging motion design semua then we can only choose three aku ambil
okay what macam aku ambil figure drawing is the same what but it's still under fine arts what
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of apa tu routes to go actually so this one I took we have to choose three then uh from that three then kita belajar then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem aku tak dapat ambil dua yang figure drawing full kan
ya so aku just have to cause my I only have to take two for my module ya huh oh my god aku four jer eh mmhmm
oh ya ya but packaging ah the aku dengan effy took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one I forget what oh design and brand strategy because honestly uh kalau kita ada tiga ni benda kan then intern kita will be easier though ya because like for us macam apa eh
ya and honestly aku tak sabar untuk intern I don't know why
cause like I feel like kita boleh pilih but at the same time macam our lecturer will be the one that ya but uh honestly after that after this coming semester kan kita ada three months holiday right then me and effy thought of like kerja at any uh graphic comm punya firm and then from there kalau like we feel that in in apa tu that company is quite good then we just continue until intern lah
dah ada kerja what you mean okay uh huh
kerja for that really meh no lah I don't think so tu ni diploma
the process then kau will first day macam for example first day kau is during that year three sem one ya I feel like it's like that ya lah so apa yang kau nak start dalam year two sem two ya lah the process is year two sem two lah ya lah okay so that's what I should've say girl
hmm entah eh I feel like it's a both pros and cons because
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can macam
then after that like uh tak the cons is like you have to compete with everybody ah
and a bit like macam
in your face tau macam company tu tak nak kau macam ouch sakit sia honestly right yesterday I saw like a lot of jobs right they dekat apa tu indeed aku nampak banyak macam art teacher abeh those apa eh
that C word I forget what is that for the ni lah budak-budak art
bukan taxi lah aduh
I mean like your course quite broad lah honestly and yesterday also aku cari macam kedai-kedai eh kedai eh company you know there's a lot of art galleries looking for people to kerja as part time eh stop it
ya so stop hais eh kau nak kerja dengan aku ke tak yang picking packer okay lah this whole week kau take a break then maybe kita start kerja next week ah
kalau bukan this week kau nak confirm dengan aku bila okay okay okay
hais no cause aku start kerja kan
so it's like no honestly if they were to put me in a retail punya position I can find other retail stores to work you know it's a stall but macam kirakan there's a lot of macam promoter at each section so you are doing that kau kat situ macam kau kena jaga overall then kau kena tengok-tengok and at the same time you have to like go for the customer ni semua lah
point you know oh my god I just censored my own ya and then like I never even get that position so aku it's a retail position or cashiering I don't know I mean it's not even promoter it's just that whole retail store kau kena take care of ya so exactly that's why aku terus like
aku dah tak aku dah quit I told shah about it and then I was super depressed you know what I did they don't even know what I'm supposed to do at that yesterday you know they just gave me the job and like oh you can just go to the customer then I'm like oh okay then after that they never tell me any other instructions
I think six hours nine eleven to six eh I just whatsapp the manager ah say like the environment is not for me uh what uh this is honestly not what I expected it lah macam this is not the position I he haven't reply but I left the group already ya kalau tak esok aku kerja esok thursday aku actually dah full this this week
tu aku nak tanya kau nak kerja picking packer ke tak no no no the packer
because just now tak ini packer packer kat dia bilang kau pack apa
toy R us actually okay eh quite good eh aku nak ni green party apa kedai dia okay dok kau tahu kan the kedai jual apa no the green party
you don't know that store dia macam miniso eh
it's okay though that kedai
what if kau kena tengok shift dia juga shift dia dengan
shift dia dengan dia punya working hours
jauh oi okay true
I don't know kalau kau nak aku boleh
kalau kau nak aku okay I don't know ah I feel like
but semalam aku ada bilang kau kan yang apa tu
yang aku screenshot lah kerja tu
mana eh
ada safe distancing ambassador eh kat sentosa eight dollar per hour jer kot
kau just uh they they what they say is that
bodoh lah kau
kau kan
entah lah everything's okay though I can say belum ah baru submission oi
tak kita tak ada kita dah tak ada ah
okay I understand I don't know ah I feel like those abeh macam general studies and all right I I don't understand macam nanti like apa kita buat then like what we dapat is like the hell
mm entah eh
eh legit ah makan ramen stall aku nak try ni ah ball
tu apa bukan tu boat noodle ramen stall is the japanese punya ni sebelah dim sum punya ni kat haji lane
macam aku nak tunjuk aku tengah record
a'ah eh betul juga eh
but then I don't want to spend so much today eh aku dah tak ada duit I spent but tipo honestly is berapa eh berapa dollar ah
allowance for this month and then kalau aku tak kerja aku tak ada duit kalau dah habis
oh my god don't say aku punya printing jer one time printing fifty five dollar eh I have to print my uh board I have to print my
apa tu photo book
ya because our now is like macam
apa tu macam buku ah kirakan
I got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my and ya they uh then end up orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah exactly so I'm like exactly then uh effy is quite mad ya
effy dia sot lah tak aku example it's like really unfair ah I don't know why but it's just the school lah I can say
you show macam orang punya kerja it's like a good thing lah but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
apa tu copy yours and do better and after that
and you are still kat bawah trying to survive padahal kau punya it's like orang yang copy
eh kau suka pergi hiking tak
tak aku macam nak pergi hiking
aku dah lama mana tak pergi hiking abeh one time aku kat abeh macam mana
entah lah
not every ah ya can say ya macam friday I fetch him and saturday the whole day expo ah so every time dia nak patah balik patah balik sunday ya
aku tak bilang siapa-siapa ya it's like I don't know ah at times we gaduh and then like but that one time we gaduh right quite rabak ya but uh the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it macam you know if we break it off then what's the point of us macam wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct correct mm the thing I like about him right dia punya mindset is really mature oi he's your age ya
then like I don't know ah dia macam dia cakap like kalau you dah tak suka I semua ke apa in our relationship anytime tau kalau aku just dah tak ada feelings but just bilang dia and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go lah kalau tak macam if he wants to make it work lah ya so it's like very matured thing ah at the same time kalau kita nak break it off
we have to really macam talk things out to each other and yup I don't see that coming any mean time ya
ya really a lot until we I think he um apa eh I call kan dia tak angkat
at that point macam betul-betul like he like we had enough of each other lah
but then macam um during the period the first few weeks terus macam makin lama makin okay then now it's better ah
ya cause that time he was on holiday then I was like quite free right dengan my school schedule then like we met almost everyday sia then I feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that
and like pejam celik pejam celik aku next month dah one year dengan dia dok
ya you remember that time where we sat at eighteen chefs and then I told you that I like this guy ya tu masih suka eh aku masih uh kerja kat seh baru baru oh my gosh then now dah nak one year it's quite fast eh really really fast

seri pun wah that time I talk to seri kat cause I say I miss her then after that wah I quite proud eh have you seen her instagram

you know like it's pointless if we keep advising but they don't really ya honestly aku tak kisah kalau dia tak nak ikut ke tak because it's usually up to the person lah but at least consider of what I say lah or like try to say it in a way whereby kau kau akan kena you know or like just reflect prepare you ya ya so it's like you are not you are not actually hearing what I said ya
what again I thought they have been bestie again daripada dulu sampai sekarang

but sayang kau kena tengok lah situation kau macam mana I feel like khine is easily
ya and kena advantage
oh my god how is she huh really ah dah kurus eh no I'm just asking a question don't take it as a bad thing bro K I understand why but I mean okay I agree to that actually daripada dulu pe you don't realise it ah kaki dia memang kecil pe
tak ke no legit legit legit mm
ya lah it's just the makeover you know entah lah
kau jangan merepek lah kau aku pun tak tahu kadang-kadang keluar kadang-kadang turun balik I'm not in a constant mood aku dah malas already
no it's not about that dengan shah aku memang tak kisah
cause aku tak pakai makeup uh aku pakai makeup aku pakai makeup that time kan dia cakap
uh you tak mahu pakai makeup ah asal
uh tak ah tak ada apa-apa then like apa dia ni berbual then aku aku that time insecure gila ah cause aku tak pakai makeup aku dah penat gila then dia cakap
tak payah makeup makeup dah lawa then aku macam okay ah ya but actually I don't know cause aku dah biasa pakai makeup so it's like a routine lah so once you tak pakai makeup it's like shit ya so ya that's me ah but honestly
entah eh because seeing back me and year one right I actually
aku year two kan legit oi macam no effort
time aku pakai makeup pun pergi luar jer mm ya aku pun dah malas
then like entah eh
apa tu dressing up and all when you're school is how many hours jer
entah ah exactly that's that's the thing
ya ya because I feel like it's very macam entah eh you feel like shit mm makeup everything ya I agree I agree because like you don't you don't want to be the
macam the sad looking person amongst all the pretty girls ah penat ah kadang-kadang
aku dengan kawan aku yang perempuan perempuan pun semua pakai makeup lawa-lawa then aku macam alamak then nanti you stress on your own oh shit what am I supposed to wear oh my god what am I supposed to actually same
but usually at some point aku dah malas gila aku pakai aku punya baseball jersey dengan aku punya jeans dah abeh orang pakai kasut kan semua lawa-lawa aku pakai slipper oi
legit eh dah malas ah mm
then eh busy punya
ya sometimes no heck care lah ya that time pun birthday party kawan aku wah I find it wah really pointless it was last week uh after I send shah then uh dress code K me being a person where I wear black and white everyday cause I'm a very monochrome person right
my friend err the dress code is warm tones alamak ya lah but then all the tu apa yang skirt tu aku dah tak boleh muat oi tu year one aku kecil sia aku sekarang dah gemuk oi legit I walk away a lot when I was with shah cause we eat a lot ya then after that aku macam alamak
I wore white t-shirt eh white uh long sleeve dengan yang skirt tu apa tu yang shawl hitam ya so it was okay
then terus aku macam alamak nak pakai apa eh tengok aku punya closet tinggal satu baju white apa warm tones kan warna brown tapi it's not really brown it's brownish yellow abeh semua stripes stripes ada warna putih then aku macam alamak pakai jer lah and then I
err for me it's like err macam very
masai ah
not aunty lah but masai ah macam entah ah selekeh ah then after that aku jumpa kawan-kawan aku semua tak ikut dress code lepas tu dia orang cakap dia orang tak ada then aku macam abeh semua pakai baju top warna putih abeh seluar hitam then aku macam bro I could've just wore that seh abeh kawan aku yang perempuan lagi pakai hitam
aku dah macam girl at the birthday party right is only the family yang pakai warm tones then aku just macam I'm like what so ya orh it's actually merepek ah oh tu pun aku dah tak boleh muat eh skirt tu ya I want to I don't know where that skirt go already or ya kita pergi museum pe cause that time ada yang mm neon light that one kind ya sekarang dah boring ah neon light
you know I don't uh she told me that she don't like but I feel that she like him dah lama cause girl
ya and then dia cakap aku ada bilang kau kan yang dia orang pergi club together and all oh my god
then aku cakap kau kalau seri bilang kau kau act macam tak tahu jer eh aku cakap gitu
ya honestly my class sekarang is not really actually bonded every class aku pergi is not bonded
it's all clique by clique by clique which I find it macam a bit irritating ah
ya so aku sekarang stick dengan effy jer walaupun the other girls kan dia orang satu clique err like ada chinese girls dengan chinese girls and then kita ada lagi satu girls macam macam indonesian dengan singaporean macam campur but dia orang semua baik ah aku punya orang is
even though I have three err I'm always like with that one friend I will always be neutral to everybody ya so macam mana-mana aku pergi nanti dia orang macam eh nelly nelly so aku macam okay ah then like um that that one group of girls semua okay lah dia orang okay dengan aku so aku okay ah
melayu indonesia cina ya campur-campur ah
cause kadang-kadang aku tak ada benda nak buat buat pun aku pergi kat dia orang macam hey how's your work
ya group work pun kadang-kadang aku just campur dia orang
err nadhirah eh uh huh khine ya dia suka
tahu pasal huh how they know
no girl it's very hard for him to like somebody and the way the girls that he like is all mostly chinese or korean or japanese dia punya pasal lah eh macam girls like angel yes ya you know malays is super hard ah kalau nak kawan dengan dia kawan rapat macam kita boleh I feel like a lot of girls jealous bila kita rapat dengan him because kita jumpa khine kita selalu macam peluk abeh rapat-rapat pe but he's like for me it's like I don't know eh
ya and I put the line already eh you know and I find him more like girl friend instead of a boy friend macam hey khine mm okay
nanti kadang-kadang macam hey girl then aku macam aku terus khine then after that ah that time aku masih in my in my clique ah aku nampak dia kat err apa campus one lobby abeh lepas tu dia macam hey girl then wear tudung tau
then semua orang tengok aku tau then terus kita lari kita peluk each other dia macam macam you know those like love movies like something then we just we just have each other ah then everyone look at us you know macam semua tak expect ah like um macam dia kan handsome nak mampus so everyone confirm macam err confirm everyone macam oh I want to be the one that is hugging I don't know lah kadang-kadang I find it macam a bit merepek ah
hmm entah aku tak tahu nak berbual dengan siapa aku macam okay let's just berbual dengan budak-budak pakai tudung mana tahu dia orang baik ah aku macam gitu but then once I heard kau hello I'm anna I'm twenty one from girl be my friend
because everyone is very young eh at that point then I'm like huh ya that's why it's like entah ah but the the reason why I was close with shaz first because I was the only one that talk to her during that general ya class
cause that time aku cakap dengan shafiq err aku just nak cari classmate aku ah macam kawan daripada class aku kan at least ah aku boleh pergi kelas dengan dia aku tak seorang ya so that's my ya because she sit in front of me tak aku just try out jer then aku just hi uh like what class you from oh I from uh one that time kita punya class apa one G eh honestly tak ingat apa dia cakap one G
oh girl same class then kita just all the way together ah plus from there aku tanya dia like
uh why you not rapat with the other girl semua like our class semua okay aku cakap gitu ah macam all about the worried about the class thingy
okay so I she's going away we're going to get her a present ah and ya I think you're right the frames are too heavy we're not going to give those but how I don't want it to be like macam buku yang just print out like that biarkan gitu then it's just gonna sit in a cupboard forever I feel like it will be cool if it was something that she
can see everyday you know especially in that country maybe lots of pictures of us in the sunshine macam while she freezing her butt off there
yes yes yes yes ya ya ya so it's not just err err apa tu what we going to make
err phone phone case it can be anything it can be a mug it can be a t-shirt boleh apa-apa kan
but no you want a gift that can on that day itself be looked at right okay okay fine ya ya then I think ya we can find some small light items nak buat dia punya print ah so we're gotta select a bunch of pictures of what we like right and then
figure out what are the things I'm sure they have online presence mesti ada kalau kau pergi dia punya website dia cakap that these are the things you can bring on or something ah or if not actually there are a lot of websites that do that so macam vista print
cause they are that kind of digital printers so they do everything so okay so let's pick out a bunch of pictures kita pilih mana yang kita suka then that becomes the photo book and then we pick out a few others ya okay can ah I guess that is the plan
aku tak ada tak ada bilik tau bilik aku is my sister you know so cause I was living elsewhere so my things were always a minimum ah and then both times when I go government staycation also
again I lost a lot of things so my whole life has been a series of losing shit lah moving and macam just all over the place so when it meant that when I moved into this house I just didn't have
why can't it not be us apa jer okay so how about we make a poster ah of us
when forever in your heart you know sort of vibes ah ya ya it's ultimate narcissism for a group that is so in love with ourselves gitu
what is the deal dia secretive gila ah sia aku tak tahu dia sekarang at which point you know are their tickets booked is that is what is happening over there you know
sharing about it like that time I I thought her her attitude was interesting like she was dia cakap that um
she don't want to talk about it to people cause she's afraid to like jinx it gitu and then she would also feel very embarrassed if she was supposed to leave on a certain date and then didn't then people will like macam
eh nisa why you never leave eh kau apa sia I'm like can't imagine who the who the hell would actually do that to her
tak aku rasa it is that ya ya ya when it comes to him you're right they got some secretive things aku aku rasa that dia cakap dengan nisa that these things kau tak payah share dengan kau punya friends I think so too I think that is that sort of understanding between them which
ya lah it's their partners lah we should respect that ah but I just thought there was some fear there you know of people mocking her and I'm like um you a bit too old to have this fear tapi dia kadang-kadang got got that kind of little streaks of like
how to be her own person ah like she will stand up to people and she will I liked it when I see her at parties and she very mother hen with all the younger ones I think it allows her to make a lot of friends cause she goes in like a kakak kakak you know she goes in like
ah kau dah okay tak and then aku boleh cakap dengan kau gini gini gitu gitu like like she's just how are you macam mana sekarang sekolah gitu gini you know and ya
ya I I don't understand what it could take macam ah ya unless somebody changes drastically and that could happened sometimes somebody becomes bitter or alcoholic you get what I mean ah then you become a bit wonky ah
ya both both both to tini okay got it okay so she felt like somehow you macam take tini
together apa kau orang semua sama-sama tu ah
so abeh at that point kau tak cakap apa-apa dengan dia
abeh kau tak terasa nak cakap apa-apa dengan dia cause kau dah tahu kan ah
ah dengan tini
siapa jas dengan tini asal eh dia orang macam
so hari tu bila kita dah sampai dekat pizza cause again I'm lost in my own world did they have a chat outside dia orang berbual
ya ya ya ya ya ya unless you're coming to eat with us then okay lah it's clear tapi kau
iya lah like like like you like to
ya okay okay okay ya ya ya nobody really likes that anyway ya ya ya yup ya ya ya I understand tahu
jadi kau bila kau berbual dengan sarah kau adalah explain dengan dia that the reason why that even came up in the first place was pasal kau nak understand make tini understand that she's being played ah
did did we post that picture in the group chat with dengan dia punya cake nama dia tu ah K K
tahu tahu tahu ya ya ya ya kau percayalah ya I know I know I know I know I know I know ya
ah correct correct it's new information for someone you know as opposed to macam mengeluh over somebody usual pattern tu lain
ya tak tahu seh cerita cerita ni semuanya
ya tu lah tu lah
then I also wonder oh is it because we just don't say these things kita mana nak belajar pasal boundary and learn how to do it
ah ah correct aku rasa macam
tu lah tu lah kami datang nak petik bunga di taman awak
ya it's the bahasa berbunga and the gentleness of the language overall lah ya ya ya makes it hard
I bet you would have kau mesti ketawa macam perempuan gila in the corner and make it a lot worse than it is nanti dia fikir aku betul-betul suan dia
confirm tau kau punya sense of humour kadang-kadang like no janganlah
ah so azmi tahu ah hari ini kau datang sini buat ni ah kau cakap dengan dia
kita tengah we are currently in about let me see twenty seven minutes we are about halfway through ah azmi can you entertain yourself
ya I did say no background noise but that was just a really quick one kami minta maaf iya
ah or maybe I do I don't know I have to go in and check that might be some ground ginger from my mum she likes this she gives me ground ginger so I could mix it with some hot water and and something okay I'll go look at it after this actually I'm getting damn hungry so after this I do aku nak pergi makan
aku nak makan mak aku punya briyani tak kisah pergi mampus dengan perut aku and come and taste some a bit sedap makan dia dengan curry all these
mak aku masak two days ago national day feasts
ah tu ah tu pun ada I didn't even know we had this tradition tapi tak pasal-pasal ah hari ni national day kita ada briyani abeh aku is not not having it so that day I was out at brunch then after brunch went over to to aman friends place right so I was
ya do you know there was my national day was so non eventful on my way to brunch which I had with a friend dekat at kat upper thomson aku pass by dekat road aku nampak banyak-banyak orang semua diri dekat luar road
then aku thought they were going somewhere but no cause it's this mobile columns that's moving right so that's why I did not know about this mobile columns at all so I was like why are they just standing there kalau kau nak pergi somewhere jalan ah asal diri sana panas terik tu hari tu aku dengar forty one degrees
apa ni you're supposed to kill people that's what the war machine is for right but ah no but apart from that I had no idea it was national day I didn't even hear fireworks can you see from here
jadi sekarang macam mana kau nak try tackle one of the questions
folklore and petua-petua kesihatan you get what I mean for like different ah different food items whether it's different types of herbs different types of leaves different types of yams whatever from indonesia
the waiter comes out and the presentation is beautiful the way he like opens up the kau tahu macam bunga-bunga apa tu eh bunga ulam eh or is it the bunga-bunga macam
look like banana flower kind of vibe ah or top ginger you know that kind where you sort of peel it open kan ah lepas tu the way yang dia orang serve and like plate the thing and then telling the explanation of what it's for and how do people use it are there any stories associated with it I thought that was a really memorable meal cause everything that you taste suddenly had a lot of significance and I'm sure we all had meals like that and I think whenever somebody plans meal kan
ah tu
bila larut malam punya vibes ah
ya ya ya actually I don't even know about I feel like I've got aku pernah dengar nama dia saffron tapi aku tak tahu kat mana dia kat bugis
where is it tampines ah okay okay okay ya lah maybe that's why aku tak travel out lah
it's very random and it goes straight to tampines I don't even know why normally the road ni kira ada feeder bus jer biasanya tapi sekarang ada one two seven apa benda
and I've been seeing a lot more of this large bright green buses punya bus baru punya ah ah dia orang macam tak tahu ni bus baru ke service baru but
ah new buses lah right that they bought ya ya ya ya so from tadi yang aku faham bus ni kalau kalau kalau kau ambil bus ni dia terus pergi highway
do not pass do not collect two hundred dollars dia terus pergi highway lepas tu kau end up in tampines in berapa minute okay lah not minute lah but iya lah you get the idea ya ya very short ah
but they take awhile they all take awhile they will go and explore kat mana kita pergi tengok-tengok err geylang mari lah kita boleh tengok katong
mm katong ya there's a lot of ah detours ah tak faham seh
ah ask bird park pun bird park aku sakit hati aku ambil bus pergi sana one and half hour sia
pantat kering ah that I basically aku need to sampai boon lay
ah bird park kau kau cakap apa zoo eh
dia orang masih tak email aku sia after aku hantar resume aku about that was I think on the seventh
dia dia cakap they didn't basically dia macam portal gitu kau upload upload resume apa benda then at the end it just had a your resume has been successfully submitted ah ah kau tunggu three weeks
then the meantime there are other things like my I have a friend who call me and it's basically what this is is a startup habis startup ni dia macam kumpul together all the plumbers electricians sort of thing okay then you would it works like a uber where you would find a service and book it and then abeh kau kau boleh tengok dia punya err err route to you ah macam macam macam grab delivery ah boleh nampak dia punya driver on the way to you how long more it will take blah blah blah
and then ah they need somebody to help coordinate this things in the back end and also err check out on the services that is provided tanya lah dengan orang tu okay okay tak dia orang buat ada apa-apa rosak ada apa-apa okay complain ke apa benda um
so that's that the job seems rather interesting tapi I'm I'm a little concerned about it on a couple of levels ah firstly dia startup abeh baru start apa apa cerita dia sebenarnya you know like what is the process and is it kau orang ada macam any or template in place or actually kau orang tengah cari orang untuk start the whole thing up you know from scratch properly cause if that's the case ya okay I I also don't have problem with that but I would need to make sure that I'm paid
there are already a lot of websites where you can even like directories and you can kau boleh filter down tau kau tinggal kat mana orang ni kat mana ah that kind of thing it's not something new ah this
pulling together of different house jobs you know plumbing ah carpentry little bit that sort of thing it really exists a lot jadi aku macam err apa seh
nak try ke tak
abeh in the meantime ada benda macam gini okay aku happy nak buat I don't know why sia I don't know ah I'm feeling macam don't want to work and then also the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and there's all this weirdness and more jobs to be lost and the economy is going to shit
it's not a way of avoiding the world it's just aku don't feel like dealing with you all right now it's too much crap I don't feel like it I'm not having it
leave ah I learn this new word vibing I'm just vibing man so kira macam tangkap jer ah vibing so I vibe ah
ah ah ah betul
betul betul betul and just live a simple basic life for awhile right ya
ya ya I would get into something quite obsessively I think you know like just explore or pursue or an interest sampai
ya ya ya the whole thing is a very romance novel vibe yes ya with the hair and the jawline it's very like the guys that you find on the cover of romance novel gitu ah
tu ah abeh macam kau terasa ah kau terasa macam kau nak extra mentel gitu tak tahu dari mana punya ni ah
that's also a romance novel apa macam the rope who you tame taming the rope
pangkeng means apa eh
oh tu tu yang kau orang panggil hotel ah rumah uncle
tak tahu seh
kau kau bayangkan hidup mesti ada concept
kau bayangkan ada cakap dengan kau hidup mesti ada concept computer programme
eh kau
kira macam gang ah ah ah ah ah
alah geramnya it's like asking your parents kita sebenarnya asal dari kampung mana seh
mm mm mm mm mm budak marsiling
okay kau boleh nampak malaysia tapi sana tak ada causeway tak ada apa kan there's no bridge
toa payoh aku rasa mungkin ada port
alah sedih
aku macam >pakai file tak pakai file pun dia orang tak kisah seh
ah ah betul
I I went to this activist event ah some time ago two years ago I think it's called apa itu activist so it was mainly organized by AWARE and a lot of other like MARUAH all this ah different activists and groups here in singapore then one of it had breakup session so then you can pick
which room you want to go to participate in which session ah so I went to this one particular room where dia orang macam mana tau macam lebih kurang tiga puluh orang tiga puluh orang sit in a circle berdiri in a circle
and then berdiri in a circle lepas tu the person yang moderator diri dekat tengah dia cakap okay if you have these things that I'm about to say you step back
if you don't if you never had these things then you step forward so they started asking ah kau ada maid tak kau pernah ada maid rumah kau abeh kalau kau ada kau step back
so abeh ask more questions ah macam kau pernah ada rumah family kau ada kereta tak kau orang pernah pergi holiday kau pernah rasa macam snow basically questions about privilege ah then at the end of the thirty forty questions that he asked
kau boleh nampak ah siapa yang kat tengah siapa yang kat belakang sikit abeh yang kat tengah banyak was a lot of brown people also cause some of the questions that was asked was also macam have have anybody made fun of your name
abeh aku found myself right in the middle with two other people
I was a bit confused about being in the middle cause I thought I ada pretty good life you know ya we got no maid no car all these tapi there's always food on the table I had uniforms I've heard so many other stories of people who had it so much worse right that was interesting but then
dia semua pun ada abeh kenapa orang lain tak boleh ada ni semua kenapa hidup dia orang nak kena sampai macam gini seh
couldn't he just kept crying and crying the group macam went around him abeh sayang sayang dia and
betul betul betul aku ada terfikir tau at that moment macam eh kau yang nangis sepatutnya aku yang patut nangis apa sia kau nangis tapi aku rasa tapi aku rasa kadang-kadang
tu ah ya ya correct correct there was a sense of that there's definitely a sense of that but then there was also a sense of maybe you need to
like be far removed from the from the situation in order to sympathize with it sometimes when you are too close in the situation dia macam apa tak kisah ah buat jer ah
tapi when you are far away you realised actually this person doesn't need to do this you know this person should be able to have other options instead of being forced to towards doing X Y Z so maybe he was in the better position to to understand privilege than we do cause he's
I don't know I don't know what it is ah about us like you said maybe it's that change over from technology that's change and suddenly from a position of being macam a bit suaku about the world suddenly we see a lot more we see a lot more riches we also see a lot more pain and poverty
eh aku tak suka ah dia orang punya cerita tak habis-habis tak habis-habis pasal aku dulu ah very very poor tau aku tak ada duit family aku tak ada duit
main soccer
macam are you listening to yourself not bro
ah kau tak ada script ke ni sikit-sikit ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya and who's writing this maybe the people writing it are tone deaf in the first place you understand like aku can imagine them choosing some like rich fuck
oh this is the whampoa ya but cause kau orang punya the other side siapa lim tian
lim tian sama dengan randolf ah
randolf was volunteering with lim tian apa
it's for people who are scared lah it does need they need to be told that cause even this election banyak kali sia macam naomi had colleagues my mother had friends who all said your vote is not secret in singapore
this fear is still there ah and aku rasa the the the likes this fear to be there cause then senang apa untuk dia orang
ah kau try ah nanti aku tak kasih kau covered walkways kau nak covered walkways
but now I see my apa I was specially recognised as a top fan
it's a facebook group ya ya ya I was so proud of myself aku macam I took a screenshot and send to naomi and say my accomplishment for today everybody we must achieve something

I actually like lupa
I lupa nak reply her
okay I'm going to reply her after I makan
then like after I makan I was like
tapi like I don't want then I felt like
so semalam like
I told my mum and my kakak was like
to like clean like cause apa nama dia err yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my almari from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the buku-buku
and then I shifted all the I I I simpan the book balik
and then what happened to the one keluar you know what time we keluar or not we went out like
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to beli right
I went to spotlight sebab I want to find
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to jahit for my
which tak habis-habis
ya so I was trying to find a breathable kain
main thing that I wanted to cari was the
like find the kain
turns out it was like dekat dalam
an almari
tadi tadi while while bathing I was
cik saya nak order
nak order suji boleh
tapi usually like people sell suji that
as I was saying tadi
I was trying to think macam like
err when is a good time for us to record lah cause macam
at five masih very very very memekak
crowded here and because that time masa masa we shot at kim punya place
yang we went to jewel eh I think
like all my close friends I only like keluar with the for like
like satu bulan eh no dua bulan sekali kind of thing you know
or like tiga bulan sekali
ah ya ya ya apa
give it a listen nanti lepas ni
I think the korean industry is kind of like macam
apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap eh
and it's damn big it's like besar gila and
real lah macam
pakai yang the one that I told you about hari tu that it karat
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs kan sebab it's like one for one
um when I was buying it I was like thinking kenapa dia punya
kenapa orang nak kena ada promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
oh it's a good deal cause like macam
mum and my kakak ah
patutlah dia jual one for one
sebab dia punya specs tak guna
then I was like lepas tu dia cakap eh cause like
your degree naik or something right
is it just tak masuk akal to me
then my kakak cause my kakak was telling me ah that um celebrities who
share that dia orang beli their glasses from owndays like they keep on macam promoting owndays that means like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why macam a lot of
specs shop is dekat dalam the display then you have to like engage the
is on display everything at macam the racks then you just take and tak payah
like the the shop that I went to dia
dia dia dia dia I sound like I'm singing oh my god
while waiting for them to fix my kakak punya glasses
like berani gila
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because macam
they have to let the migrant workers work sebab of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
talking about apa nama dia um
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I masuk then I was like what is all these two faced people

like to me right it's like tak tahu malu ke like you already like cling onto like someone
try everyone else macam
macam like common ya
they are macam
suruh dia kahwin chef ah
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan
even if they don't have like long term macam five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel macam
they should have at least like a one year plan kalau tak macam
what you menganggur
oh I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it oh serahkan pada like allah and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your usaha man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it

for yang baju-baju baby ah baby
aku tak tahu aku tak tanya nama aku just kasi tu aku cakap harga
tapi ni dia baru update aku apa dia nak esok baru aku layan ah
not Su Mamat just now my tudung boss was asking me also nak aku nak combine dengan dia ke tak buat this um baju lah
yang apa ni yang style uh uh I mean combine dengan dia punya tudung plus baju aku lah dia ingat aku buat sorang so she can combine tapi aku cakap aku ada partner lah she okay lah since kau dah ada partner susah nak combine kan
pasal ni dia nak buat macam untuk reseller reseller sekali dia macam aku ada reseller gitu
ah cuma aku combine dengan dia makna kita keluar modal sama-sama lah
tapi in a bigger tu lah aku cakap dengan dia ah aku ada partner but kalau dia nak wholesale macam biasa lah aku apa but wholesale with the other rest yang I always um you know introduce with lah
oh dia suka yang tunic ah yang tunic and the knit and the slip top dia suka sangat cause the slip top is very comfortable right
ya so she love it so much she wants to belanja again so I was saying to her lah if you want to for your your ni wholesale I will take the same price as whatever I give lah
yang same price with every wholesaler lah
mm ah kau tahu aku mark up a bit only what she she said maybe not the time yet lah
ah ya lah cause dia ingat aku sorang
oh tak dia dia
dia ada duit cuma dia ingat nak nak collaborate pasal dress and baju dia macam tak berapa apa into it sangat kau faham tak
ah dia macam pernah try tapi tak berapa berjaya lah
tapi aku cakap aku ada partner kan so aku cakap kalau benda lain like maybe kalau aku nak combine dengan dia macam things like I'm not selling like jeans ke apa maybe I can go for that lah you get what I mean or not pasal ada sisters sisters yang lain pun they wanted to combine lah together something that is not I think like right now there's a lot of sellers who are selling this dresses and all that stuff right
um I suruh dia ah boss aku tu ah
how much is it ah babe how much is it how much per kotak
for harga harga for retail is it retail price is it
cause they don't want ah they want to be the same on par with the Malaysian punya apa orang kata commission
so maybe they are earning about two ringgit or per box or maybe four ringgit per box so Singapore also they will put that kind of price lah tak lebih sangat commission daripada you know Malaysian punya counterpart lah you know kalau tak jadi macam perbualan kan competition like that
dia nya size tu not even one palm
budak-budak makan tak cukup seh
mmhmm it's a healthier choice of uh air batu Malaysia kan
about four thousand three yes four thousand three hundred friend aku nya page aku nya page ada about uh six hundred
aku nya personal aku ada
two thousand over friend personal jer eh and then aku punya page aku ada two hundred
over lah two hundred forty four baru ah okay because it's a new page but
hello how many is my viewers aiyo like berapa less than dua puluh orang huh
I don't know lah what but then aku still bersyukur lah you know even though in on live memang tak tak banyak sales but after live off live is like orang will find me to ask lah you know is there any stocks
ah yes yes you know Nina Sazali pernah uh buat kan she show all her piles of dead buyers you know
ya cause dia dia punya she showed ah
it's been like two months now I'm still having like less than twenty viewers and that day yang si cousin aku tu first time live jer daripada shop yang tu jer dah macam
ada banyak juga terjual ah abaya dia dia buat abaya is like thirty eight dollars you know the abaya
aku tak I didn't watch uh I didn't watch the punya live sampai habis cause aku pun malas kan
ah aku memang I'm very moody ah on that last week I was very moody ah I was not on the what is it called on the I don't know I'm I was feeling down I was feeling down last week I don't know maybe cause of that negative punya experience you know
and then and then we had Aminah Muslim punya experience and then cousin aku punya campur aduk with the abaya stuff
ya the last yang four hundred dollars three hundred seventy seven some sort like that
she ya still got balance the last balance was three hundred over lah nak dekat four hundred so that was from her mother-in-law at last ah macam she like I don't know ah I I feel like she's like gali lubang apa tutup lubang eh abeh gali lagi
maybe ah babe you know what the the the punya tu is registered under her husband name of course lah mother-in-law dia tolong seh
and bo pian cause this one is a big money seh but I think eh dia dah scam orang lain dulu tau but I don't know lah aku try to search in Facebook about her background whatever kan so far nobody viral her you know why
kita punya barang or not you get what I mean or not
this thing will be like very sampai satu kali dia tak boleh bayar satu orang ni kan then I think the person will viral her
I don't know for me right cause she refunded us she got a lot of evidence nanti dia cakap dia ada evidence lah gedebak gedebuk lah you know but maybe ah kalau ada satu orang cakap anyone has any dealing with Aminah Muslim before muslimah before maybe I think a lot of people will comment
ya husnuzon lah mm
I mean ya I try but I'm not gonna order from her anymore the thing is I'm angry with her I'm quite upset cause she mentioned that I am dia punya regular customer which is which I my first time seh
how can you share a my conversation with another person saying that I'm to to to show that you are konon honest gitu lah kan
oh cause ah aku baca dia cakap nak kena uh only uh berapa percent jer melayu
no no melayu nak kena kurang daripada English actually
yes that's right so that's why you've been talking melayu all the way kan ah so you have to you cannot dia macam nak kena ada sixty percent of uh I think it's lower
so apa ni uh so that's why lah aku rasa macam
ah aku quite upset with her cause she you know she just mentioned my name without apa ni
suka suka cakap aku ni macam dia cover up her her her apa
ya cause she also mentioned to the person yang dia punya husband is not working for a few months already
the the one who sustain the business is the one yang dia scam kita you get what I mean or not
at times at times dia bukan kat situ at times bapa her father-in-law dia mother-in-law dia melayu
and laki dia melayu
uh huh dewa
ah all the Malay punya ni ah
mm so maybe she but but the person who uh the the refunded yang one K tu dia pergi dia dah pergi kedai dia
she was there but the second time that she came down it was the bapa mertua
ah yes so that's why she doesn't want to make a scene dia keluar daripada kedai tu dia tunggu si Aminah Muslim ni dekat dah lah aku tak tahu nama dia betul Aminah Muslim ke tak padahal dia put Aminah Muslim aje agaknya
and then after that dia apa ni uh she buy time again ah buy time
she doesn't even have actually supposedly that time she have to pay seven hundred okay sekali terus dia cakap ah I only have
ya lah she scam another person lah babe she go and advertise she say who want to buy wholesale then people like us macam aku will go and message her and then she will say oh minimum this kind of amount thirteen dollars per piece you know that kind of thing
then uh in fact um this Aminah Muslim right uh the the other the other party who was also scammed by her ah dia also use the same tactics like said the delivery man run away with the items
the the Thai suppliers told her that Aminah Muslim tak order langsung
so which sources and then Aminah Muslim Aminah Muslim ni macam cakap uh please show me the message macam dia ada cakap buat apa aku nak show kau message tu seh
dia kena buku dengan ruas eh yang orang suka kaki viral eh she will get it ah confirm
that's why that's why macam kita have to apa orang kata ambil sikit-sikit ah cuma aku nak tahu juga si Lia tu dapat daripada mana ni
mm that one is a love your style that one is love your style dia punya Facebook
oo okay I saw the the advertisement also she have a few uh few uh apa ni baju which is the same
twenty five lah dia tu
mm I hope this one is true lah at least we have a you know direct supplier yang trustable lah you know
I already told her just give us uh new design you tell us lah cause malaysia punya boleh dapat lebih cepat apa
mm I'm not sure tapi tengok daripada Thai Thai punya supply juga I think
eh have you seen that patchwork that retro patchwork yang the baru punya retro marble ah
uh yang si Sadiah tu pun bawa and I saw a few others yang bawa
this it's it's pleated but it's the same like marble design but the colours are more glaring yang dia ni pun ada tunjuk aku Jenny ni dia ada tunjuk aku juga the colours lah but I I I feel like we already have the marble right right
ni pun tengok tengok ni lah babe tengok rezeki orang ah
ya ada yang big pleats ada yang smaller pleats
ada yang macam the quality yes ada yang termasuk
ya for me aku rasa yang macam ada tunic tu tunic is also considered as pleats kan tapi dia tak macam pleats sangat kau faham tak macam dia ada spread
ya cause I think the ruffle dress is pendek
just put it at Nina Sazali it will be a hot kicks lah for us habis lah
ah like they said dream big to have a shop or whatever I don't have that dream to to make it into a shop macam aku nak pergi sewa kedai ke I don't have until that goals you see
ya and overhead kau nak kena ada manpower
macam gini ambil macam sambil lewa sambil lewa you know just on and as and when
ya so that's why for me when I do this um online thingy it's actually for for aku to stay at home to do side income not for me to go out and go to another shop
yes true cause my kids are still small I I'm I'm also working in the morning you see so I don't see maybe like flea market I'm okay with that cause it's a one once and on on and off punya event
but I think if you buy the garment kau tahu you know the steamer the garment steamer that one left hand
berapa dah lima puluh ke kau eh fifty eh okay oh ya you're forty now ah
eh age doesn't matter okay it's just your dream to achieve it the dream even Saadiah ah she said lah next year kita buka kedai lah I was like seriously
dia nak boutique you know boutique she wants to open a boutique like her dream is very big ah you know like inside my heart oh no way I'm not gonna dream that big you know
but then again I I think that she is like what you know semangat lima minit kind of person
oh kucing ah oh okay cat fighting ya
okay so like like I said lah so I mean I'm not jealous of the sales or whatever but I'm just a bit pissed off at how she can like berkinja-kinja you know at the live she used my words like wanita lindungan kaabah all these you know and then but with me huh pening lah pening lah pening lah over here pening over there pening
the other one is the lady's punya ah um dia punya apa ni ah anak mmhmm
ya tak ada hati ya cause of the way she treated me as a what
ya and then what she's find find me so low class meh cause I don't have any I got a condo maybe you get what I mean like for me lah never mind lah I mean we can find our own supplies I mean surely but slowly ya slowly slowly we can you know memang we never come out with a lot of money lah but then again we just order a bit by bit whatever we can lah mm
one one person one person one who really wanted so I I already told her that one is the Saadiah punya friend ah she wanted to buy she messaged me just now
nanti barang tak datang and then after that people will chase us I don't like all these you know I don't want to drama drama
ya my my mother side a lot eh my mother nya auntie dia punya buat downline banyak seh eh I think eh this thing is very good lah sarah I mean I'm the one who eat it right
I'm not saying to promote my my item lah but then again I feel that this is good Roslan makan pun he can find energy ya
ya he took ah sarah eh dia kerja malam kan dalam pukul dua belas dia makan kan it can help him to survive until five baru rasa ngantuk
whatever lah I mean if you then then like that is personally lah from my own experience yang I'm having right now I can talk personally to people outside lah without putting it in my Facebook right
dia macam tak kasi aku apa macam maintain ah maintain maintain my weight so far lah aku dah cause dia kasi kita process kan kita punya toksin kan
I am I am anti weight machine punya orang I wouldn't even like want want to go up
babe my my auntie kurus nya pun diabetic before that also she like that sia also diabetic it doesn't matter is your the way you eat
but then again ya lah eh just now I cooked asparagus sedap seh that day I get a free asparagus I got asparagus I don't know from um a donation drive from my block
not lah Workers Party punya agaknya
oh wow your husband don't want you to be an influencer I mean I mean you know what when you do this kind of charitable work eh or you know like you make to save the earth save the frog save the animals you know that kind of thing save food you know I mean at the end of the day you're actually giving to um orang yang memerlukan the feeling of that to do this social work is very very apa orang kata ya it's very rewarding in fact it is
ya it takes two hands ah ya I mean but if you have a husband who is quite macam understanding that okay you're doing this for a good cause I mean he will let you go to do this it's good lah you know but I know that some people have different different perspectives of
marriage or you know how they want to control their partner lah or you can become the wanita lindung kaabah lindungan kaabah number three lah never mind lah redha redha
she will be in primary darjah dia baru darjah no darjah empat lah ah darjah it's primary four ya
kan so I don't I don't know ah it's very stress ah fikir kan ni semua
it is it is a must for me to change the school to Tampines cause it's better for her macam dia boleh rest after school cepat balik betul tak the Tampines north is very near to my house
so kalau dia dah balik sekolah dia terus boleh balik you know it's very tiring you primary school primary four abang will be in secondary school so by the time I think he will be home by what four four also now they all have extra extra activities after school right
mm mm mm so I really hope this is really stressing me up also stressing abang up abang doesn't look stressed but I look stressed he was like saying chill lah mak I can do it
tepuk eh tepuk
alright here we are today what's up talking via this audio recording dan juga di zoom recording err macam
kejap ah kau tahu kau punya audio recording apa ni ada there's another additional sounds
so aku tengok lah ada orang orang ni like there're influencers in itself so what happen is when aku tengok dia punya comments like those who especially supporting the the the winners
err apa president the vice president
um I mean people have their own perspective and opinion lah but I think for those who support with the current winner apparently kena kena kata orang kena trashed kena slammed
aku tak sangka that actually trump the previous candidate have a lot of supporters so every comment is like oh my god I can't believe this your statement I'm gonna unfollow you
ah itu kau boleh nampak different lah because
from that day onwards I'm sure si trump punya followers pun macam K I'm gonna unfollow you I'm not gonna support you but somehow they will reappear lah they just love to comments that's why I said there's a lot of them I'm like so surprised
and we just looking to apa ni um barang-barang yang kau boleh beli via Carousell
nak beli eh ya that's crazy man like
plan B lah but sometime good eh kalau kita orang sekarang kena berwawasan sikit
ah macam dia lah dia berwawasan kita kita suka dia punya macam cara dia very determined eh tak malu ah so this kind of people actually it's good for err business lah actually he will likely be more drivel and you can really sell you know
uh so I think the police is so good to sum everything out and and make sense on why this happen and he siasat dia punya prime suspect
ya jangan tidur jangan tidur
sabar sama sama so semalam aku knockout then I just bangun balik perasan it's really really damn good movie
ya so kalau korang ingat back in the days err maybe in nineties
kalau korang tengok the witchcraft or the craft there's four women
who in a college itself and no one can mess with them lah so siapa-siapa try to hurt them or try to be nasty with them you gonna get retribution but also there's consequences of doing whatever they're doing so
so yang dia mati tu eventually it's there's another plot twist lah all together we thought that because of the spell by the craft actually it's not ya
it's damn good plot twist of a witchcraft not so horror not really walaupun ada ada juga yang terperanjat
apa lagi ya
the nun definitely mata kau buka besar-besar ah
aku lagi cerita yang buat kau thrilled terperanjat untuk kau macam watch all the way yes of course
apa lagi satu eh
there's err conjuring annabelle ada kena mengena kan
oh geram
tu wah rembat tu get so emotional rich
so this man is like actually just killed his wife with the hell out dia punya err wife remarried so he's not happy go and killed both of them
I think in is not something new ah because before that dia ada tunjukkan eh err lot of accidents or orang gaduh eh gaduh all this
so this man doesn't let her off easily ah kan surrounded with dekat orang gaduh kan so the man stalking her wherever she go and do a lot more than that so there's a lot of suspense
and they just like couldn't understand it or something kadangkala macam tu tak make sense aku rasa marah sangat ni tapi memang orang macam begini like kata orang dah you are negative by itself so the banyak amarah yang belum unsolved it just like add on of the road rage thing
so he escalated the matter by killing by killing did he ah he killed he killed some of this lady punya
kau pakai earpiece
okay tak nampak ah sekali tak eh
eh kau cerita lah
siapa they met a guy kat reunion
mm mm kan gared gared is the ni mm
I think tu bukan secretary itu attorney also
just pasal dia like junior
to the ni the main err ni lah
so kesian
not bad though that's not bad at all the efforts are um a bit sceptical about it nanti bila tunggu lama sikit
pasal ah kita dah benchmark eh kita dah tengok movie banyak sangat
second mesti ada subtitles because I tend to tak tak I kita tengok macam like where's the subtitle yo and how am I going to understand these they speaking english with slangs and very thick accent ya
five minutes of the says is important so say wrong buat semua terkeliru eh kuat sangat lah kutuk trailer
what else that we do err today oh kita ordered nasi ambeng eh
ah nasi ambeng dia adalah dari sebuah kedai ni
err ya not bad lah err like fifty bucks for two to three pax and then like the entire dulang
uh huh paru sambal goreng
kalau sayur tu kurang least favourite bukan pasal tak suka sayur apa tapi dia tak berapa lembut
ah masak sayur jadi lembut sikit eh
what else did we did today err we'd like to cover ourself with a lot of selimut selimut
selimut bukan semut K in case kau tak dengar so siapa yang tak dengar ni selimut S E L I M U T
ya hujan
hujan pun later started
camera is sleeping and my husband like bedek lah ni bedek dia ni tak kelip mata tak buat apa-apa dia diam jer
but then aku tengok macam makin aku naik makin dia punya tank makin apa dia makin pendek
ya aku ingatlah towards sana lead to somewhere else but no I'm going actually if I didn't end it I'm gonna get myself eaten by the crocodile oh my god crazy you got my adventurous in another way ya
primary four kot that time chill lagi anak-anak kecil ya
anak-anak headache
apa maksud engkau dengan tak berapa takut dengan crocodile
dan kau cakap kalau dia jump macam mana ah jadi aku berwaspada
err aku
I would rather follow the makcik-makcik rombongan you know they just saw take pictures
we saw the makcik eh in the botanical garden
some rabak ah rabak gila ah
monkey mengamuk monyet mengamuk teruk bro
aku belum nampak or tahu satu but aku tahu member guna sepak slap on the face
ya monkey monyet but tu dia same monkey business monyet
ada aku suka yang kecil lah maybe the baby one are cute and friendly and and playful
selamat monyet tu kurang bijak ke tahap that dia tak buka water bottle tu dia tengok takde air dia campak kau balik
ah tapi actually masa dekat bridge tu ni monyet ni dia ada agenda aku dah nampak daripada mata dia
like you better shut dia macam fine lah you better shut up when we're not going to say anything I'm going to jump on her bag I say okay alright go ahead
yes eventually they jump there's err grab a bottle from you lepas aku cakap I tahu kenapa but yang that err he very sneaky and he just noise trying to communicate to me the moment he hop on your bag but he look at me again
aku macam okay bro yo no monkey business
and happily they keep proper padahal air takde air kosong
atau kau just
kurang ajar punya monyet eh
ah nak kasi kasi betul-betul lah
aiyo so crazy oh so now kita nak kena bawa kayu eh to frighten them ah
ah singapore ni monkey kayu jalan weh tak tak aku rasa ambil kayu dia campak kepada kau balik
oh ya man no kangaroo I got a close up of the baby because someone next to me managed to macam kasi makan
but I didn't get to touch just in case something else or the mother or the father don't like and then just hop on me mampus sia ya
so the kangaroo barely run away they don't really eat it whenever we offered there's there's the like uh we bought quite a bit ah tapi tak tak boleh banyak makan seh like we bought like two two or one eh I don't remember
get fed by us ah the the time ah and then ada kasi makanan dia apa so at the end kita kasi dengan
birds and ni kan the ducks
they them datang ah
that's definitely but my um in my thought is like kalau pasal kita balik like
because it was there usually it was there already but it's always nasib kalau kena tak kena but I think this is gonna go higher because they are
we all know COVID is not easy thing for those who kena
it's a bit contradicting because it really depending on the government punya you know command
how how do I put it this way like we know like work still goes on but on the same time macam
kau tahu benda ni dah badly affected and I think when we talk about ke apa kan
ya tapi aku rasa
I don't see that we are macam lagi banyak lagi banyak benda kena push in so macam
atau it's like home comfort and thing since everything is going online then just do online lah kan
ya there the other thing is your kerja jalan lah unless kau kena micromanaged by your own company ah so
ya man yo so kita ada dalam masa berapa ni lagi tiga belas minit eh lima belas minit ah
and those are not definitely feel macam ah you know I mean
that's not easy you know especially for a pengantin ah
where it's gonna be how it's gonna look like and you know having all the family friends is there and err ramai meriahkan wedding there's always the kids but now it's different it's gonna be very low-key kind of kau tahu macam kahwin senyap-senyap I felt that that's how it is lah
unless unless you no need to macam invite people dia macam immediate family kau nak totally buat kecil-kecil just make sure everything sah then done but if you still need numbers of people coming in and then
you expecting little thing you know then I think is not the time yet lah kalau kau betul wedding kau grand you have certain expectation altogether and better don't lah not the time yet
kalau korang just sebab ada mum is there then just go ahead lah
ya I think kalau cakap sah ni and dia pun ada the elderly lah
so pasal kalau keluar kan orang wear mask kan and and not everyone is like comfortable with it
because that's their main entertainment like kalau dulu kan kita keluar I think they always go out go where pasar geylang ah
ah little india or wherever a shopping mall ke or visiting the bazaar ke ah membawang kan
mengopi lah mengumpat lah whatever lah sekarang stuck at home what to do know besides on the phone then
okay cerita lama okay
aku nak tengok ni drama perempuan tiada dosa eh perempuan yang tidak berdosa right ya

which was a bit macam irritating ah kan okay at that point of time um
err from my father's point of view ah kan okay then no no no kira in my father's point of view it was irritating ah

eh but ya aku faham ah like err because at one point of time also aku like I want to delete facebook
tak tahu eh macam it's it's actually a waste err like okay sometimes err or in fact most of the times ah when I look facebook right I look at facebook it's about it's news err like like err about the current situation than there's um
depends ah depends ya but is most of the time nanti kadang-kadang you know like like err news then there's err music updates abeh ah yang those bands yang aku like minat ah aku look up to their facebook then aku will try to see what's what's going on ah in their lives
updated ah but but but for me to macam okay for
aku nak post err benda-benda aku sendiri aku post like something macam bodoh ah like it's something funny never never serious tak pernah rasa macam leceh ah
mostly bila aku nak post tu is err kebanyakkan like err funny stuff ah I I don't like to post macam benda-benda serious ah ya macam entah life is too short to be serious
dia macam kelakar seram oh
oh ya ya the comments speaking of which actually we're supposed to talk about music right oh this is about music right okay okay sorry sorry sorry kugiran music(ppo
ya but anyways ya that that facebook thing that we are talking about sekarang ni kan macam I also agree ah like most of the time kan nanti aku tengok um the comments eh nanti aku kekek sendiri ah
very sungguh punya truthful
eh wait I'm sorry kau daripada penang kan
ni cerita betul lah ni
sorry to interrupt the the one in the picture outside ah oh that's your the grandfather that kau tengah berbual ni ah okay okay sorry carry on
speaking of many kids err aku punya cousin eh sorry kira mak aku punya cousin ah punya side eh

oh it's a kira macam french punya kind of err usually okay usually luke is L U K E kan
right ah so this is french kira french punya version of
luq apa ah
just err ya let's go back to like currently let's go back to the ya the which is music ah so kira like nowadays kau dengar what kind of um music ah
and then and then they will macam err terbawa-bawa abeh that's it
ah abeh then the next day they are your enemy ya
yes because okay err before okay before kita continue dengan kau punya music err current music err you err current music are you listening to
we used to grow up with macam err punk rock right punk rock then the ska then there's reggae and what what not right
era tu kira that time ah kan that era so but um
what got err kira-kira while how did you get into err this like current music that you are listening to
ya because I like to ask questions kan ah macam tak ah but because err like that time err like I really enjoyed macam
the fact that you were on drums because you knew what you were doing that's the most important part about being a drummer you just have to know what you're doing yang penting
kau terror
yang penting kau terror eh
dan sekarang kau main guitar
huh iya ke
yang penting kita terror bro
guitars ya macam okay because susah datang ah like it's usually okay when the macam drummers they will stick to macam drums all the way like throughout their lives drum drum drum drum drum then um
but you it's like a different case you before err after you like um kind of macam give up playing drums you actually went into right
oh gitu ya I actually tried you know macam
um or like techno or err what what what genre do you mention earlier on tadi
ah okay okay despite I want to understand macam further err okay disc jockey when you say you mix one song to another song kan so which means you have two turntables correct
so what you are trying to achieve is kira macam kau nak make
err like err a track from scratch betul tak
okay so okay in in in bands punya kind of a point of view band eh it's like you want to have your own band instead of play you're having a band with err kira main cover ah gitu
betul tak ah
which is a bit ya leceh ah kan macam might as well we play err kita punya own originals so that is what you want to achieve in
ni lounge eh
eh kira macam during that time bila bila kau do all that kan macam
best tak
oh that explains kira guitar tu is mostly um bila kau dah like into dirty blues and stuff like that lah
so um macam tadi aku cakap kan
aku tengah sakit perut so I was like oh my god tak boleh tahan okay that was an awkward topic okay maybe let's talk about um okay what do you want to talk about

I mean at the end of day I mean ah how how much netflix can you watch right within a day I mean aku tengok netflix one one hour drama pun dah aku dah macam lethargic gila like alone like to be staying I mean right now I'm staying home lah because because of this the whole entire err situation
I mean K mine was quite interesting I mean err as you know aku kan buat caregiving job kan to my friend so err I mean yesterday I was just resting I mean the day before so of course err
um when it comes to have to my friend need um what I do normally is I go over to his place um I will like um prep him lah and keep him proper and like aku mandikan dia
uh and then dia nak berak and everything so aku dia and everything then aku nak kena siapkan dia so everything took like one hour plus and then after that
err we were waiting for transport because kawan dia nak kena hantar tau hantar dia so we were like one hour late for the appointment so we're supposed to be there by three
but we only managed to get the transport by like three forty five lah almost four lah so lambat lambat lambat gila so by the time we reached err the hospital
err hospital tu somewhere around dekat err in the east
so it was almost four so by the time kita masuk then the the therapists were saying like err one hour lambat and everything lah last standard procedure lah huh but they would just do their best lah because of this COVID nineteen kan
so okay lah I mean it it then after that aku hantar dia balik and then lepas tu bila aku hantar dia balik after that there was guest that came in so the guest happens to be err like err dia punya adik punya wife punya parents
so of course aku nak kena siapkan lah I had to like wipe him err tukar baju dia tukar t-shirt dia and everything so I had to like prep him and then he was dia pun nak makan
dia dah makan err then the the parents of err dia punya err apa tu adik dia punya wife masuk tau into the room
and then it was like so awkward ke tu orang tua aku tak tahu kenapa dengan orang tua but bila dia like when they entered the room aku dah tahu okay this is going to be a very sombre sedih atmosphere
it's kind of betul gang ah they were talking to my friend and then they started to cry aku dah macam ya alah aku cakap no don't cry and then after that the one thing that made me even macam tersentuh sikit lah bila bunyi apa tu
your phone ah kacau jer your phone oh your alarm okay tak apa tak apa so apa tu semantic noise so ah so okay back to my story so lepas tu ah then the the mother lah the mother said to me lah ah nama anak nasri ya
then like mm a'ah cik nama saya nasri dah okay I was feeding my friend right so after that the mum was like nak nak tahu kan anak suap anak suap err err kawan ni anak dapat pahala aku dah macam aku tak tahu apa nak buat do not know how to continue the convo
ya ya ya ya ya and then aku dah macam
ya ya it's true it's true and then aku macam and then err lepas tu err then the mother was like saying err um saya jaga err suami saya dia masuk hospital enam kali then I'm like eh kamu bual err personal story pula kat aku aku dah macam macam mana nak react ah so aku macam then I I try my best
a'ah I tried my best to stay composed lah then after that err aku pun dah macam alamak aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah start nangis then they started to cry aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam no no no no this this cannot dia they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am macam tak boleh I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up macam tersentuh ah and then automatically my air mata will mengalir you know so I was like then I was like quickly err err apa tu kasih suap then after that I just say uh
cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap lah so I went out of the room lah then when I went out the room
and then kau tahu apa you know my mum's friend um
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya kiranya my my friend punya mum
mother lah kirakan ah tak boleh masuk you know inside the room because you see ah
because yang sakit tu anak dia tau so bila so she is and then she's also sakit so when she will feel sedih you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition dia akan nangis
ah yes yes yes that like she feel like macam anak dia akan pergi dulu you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then aku dekat dapur and then the mum would would like tell me lah like like you know err the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say err
tu lah err takde orang lah yang dia kesian you know aku punya kawan macam dia kan sekarang pun yang jaga dia it's like the father and the maid apa the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend lah so macam so sometimes bila dia tak mampu to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first apa because the mother is the priority first apa
so you know at times kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa err dia pun sometimes will say you know like err
puas hati masukkan err dalam ni lah rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already ah and then the mother the mother say lah macam
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like macam golongan really yang orang tua lah
so sometimes bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak react with aku dah macam huh macam mana nak what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like macam err takpe lah cik sabar lah cik cik tahan jer lah
but even the the mum also say lah macam the mum somehow I can feel like the mum macam somehow appreciate aku lah macam akan cakap apa like what you tell me like err
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum macam
the mum really appreciate aku ah the mum macam sometimes I think the mum dia tersentuh lah and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon ah tak silap
because they dia dia orang orang boyan I think boyan ke jawa I think err jawa jawa sorry dia orang orang jawa
the parents are orang jawa so so so nasi rawon is like a big thing lah so I didn't come on the day she masak cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend lah like macam eh aku tak dapat datang ah tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat
so the then the mum said ah tu lah cik masak ah hari tu tapi tu lah err anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang I'm like sorry lah cik K I mean
honestly aku cakap dengan kau
aku kan nak balik kan in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
uh dia automatically dia akan sedih so aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak react then he he say to me lah like hey can you do macam online from here then I'm like huh how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia
I mean after so many years of just macam you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now macam you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time macam kita have that conversation with beberly kan
ah yang kat mcdonald's err like I was very very lost when I was like what umur aku twenty two all the way to twenty seven can you imagine I was lost for almost five years
so so that's why I was like telling myself err when when comes to to my friend lah ya aku tak boleh tolong dia all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to ulang balik come back because of the whole swab test err quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day dia dia pun nak kena redha and I aku pun cakap dengan dia lah macam
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just macam
he always dia dia selalu ingat yang
yang aku jer seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia
then aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia lah macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya cousin setakat cousin aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa
tapi dia dia macam tak lah macam macam err then dia cakap lah yang cousin aku tak take initiative and everything
mum betul betul betul
memang membastard rabak punya
ya I mean I don't know lah err I mean err if I if I want to share you personally then kau macam
err he even ni tau that he gave a certain amount of money to me tau
and the amount is one K with dia kasih aku dia jadi macam sedekah kat aku dia cakap eh err you take lah this money to pay for your semester fees as alhamdulillah but at the end of the day at the same time aku rasa macam
kau tahu macam you are tied down to something that's why aku kalau boleh tak nak macam
I don't want to accept the money lah you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because um dia dah ada ni ah you know sometimes orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat kan
so aku just accept graciously lah and aku and I I I feels that money to pay for my err semester fees err for my err semester lepas
ah ya it feels like an amanah you know so by the but aku pun rasa macam serba salah lah macam need doing kaus eh macam
then dia cakap tak apa tak apa just ambil aku macam alamak macam mana tu but but you see like see aku dah macam you see ah like my my my err university journey like a hamburger lah alhamdulillah I would say that macam err my urusan has been dipermudahkan lah
uh with regards to my semester fees I mean err I have contribution from my late my my late step grandfather my late uncle and then then dia juga ah apa tu contribute to my semester fees
ah rezeki so macam like I say lah like you are tied down to something lah so aku kalau boleh macam
ya and I like somewhat in debt but at the same time aku macam
macam this is my my share lah macam aku kalau boleh tak nak mungkir tau macam because
aku rasa unless you are dedicated to the person and then macam you if you are not dedicated to the person you would not help the person all the way to the extent lah I mean as I do not know of any other person who does the same thing as me I think I'm the only one lah as of now lah
mm betul
betul understood understood I faham faham
kira him selfish lah in one way or another
mm lepas tu
oh macam gitu eh
mm betul
I mean in your situation now of the fact that kau macam you I mean you kau kau agak you are quite
you are in a situation you are in a difficult situation right now lah like like does your family macam help you out do do do they do they like err do they like give their their hand or shout out to you like eh do need help do they even ask you eh syaf kau okay tak
macam mana babe
understood understood is it intentionally atau macam
ya lah faham faham
dia pun tak tahu dia I mean in that kind of situation dia pun macam ah don't know what to say
wah the quite young ah you shavana your your brother dah ni kan oh ya ya ya ya so should be
you are now kita twenty nine
and your mum has not remarried eh sampai sekarang eh
your mum has not remarried sampai sekarang eh
understood lepas tu
kecoh ke oh my god this is so macam oh my god
yup betul betul
mean he lost it lah tak dapat
oh your oh macam your father is the macam very the old school punya ni eh
very dominant macam apa tu match up begitu tapi ni lelaki punya
ah kalau old school ya betul betul that's true it's true it's true
mm faham faham faham
mm betul
eh no err not bumi err in syurga syurga
correct correct so your your your sister said your mum said tak nak lah
betul betul to repay him back like you you you guys feel like macam aiyo kenapa aku nak kena kasih dia duit sedangkan time aku besar dia he was never there in your life
mm betul betul
so he he I mean he's I mean not not it's not calculative it's just that he likes to compare and count like that lah in money in belanja
ah faham faham faham
ah faham faham faham
mm faham faham
err dia tak go through apa you and your uh and your other siblings went through the hardship you know nak cari makan and everything and how your mum raise you guys up and everything
eh kau nangis ke kat situ
you haven't kau takde intention nak go onto public sector ke
masuk like teaching I don't know maybe
but untuk I aku rasa macam
err the ones yang err macam study hard apostrophe
will progress kuat juga then the ones yang err tak progress are the ones yang macam mediocre
will just fought out in society aku masih ingat err I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher err he
ah now when I think about him ah when I think about that statement ah about what he made at last time ah aku macam eh you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad ah you you are that ah that
macam his statement ah macam ada sense of macam elitism you know macam macam macam how our err government ah macam gitu that kind of it's like the vibe right there the dia kasih ya
macam very similar to how the government macam how the government is like lah so aku fikir eh you mean apa yang people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are err apa tu content with what they have so
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so um so before I went there in my head I always thought macam able to kan aku nak belajar kat sana then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive lah in the beginning lah or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore kan pakai cambridge kan and sana they have their own system tau ah for apa tu macam for how to grade and grading and everything
and then kat sana aku perasan wah the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart eh we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know macam ones from sabah with the ones from johor
the ones from perak like aku dah aku I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but aku realize about them is what they lack is
they are they are very err examination based kau faham kan exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is macam hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is macam err the examination is err it's it's it's it's very straightforward ah macam uh you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like err those yang macam err critical thinker
is tak banyak tau kat sana
the ones yang critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones yang from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question yang macam critic yang macam higher thinking ah
but because our our education system is dah macam nurture us like this kan but bila when we go there dia orang think yang kita ni super on tau
so aku macam huh super on eh not really leh it's just that uh our just that our culture macam singapore culture has trained us to be like this macam and then some more you have to understand aku kat sana aku pay enam ribu eh
so every hour and every minute tu bagi aku is duit so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like macam when ah so sometimes they they the malaysian kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam
dia orang they are quite intimidated lah even my classmate also told me ah yang the very first time they met me they she feels that I am aku sombong aku arrogant aku cakap eh serious ah
she say ah engkau macam poyo ah aku dah serious ah poyo
ah poyo then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with aku I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my kepala would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior lah because you are overseas mah you're like you need to hustle apa and then then
alhamdulillah I would say that I am coping very well lah I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that aku drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second um
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself err then I was not really focused ah like I still remember like the day before the exam baru aku nak belajar can you imagine
ya yang answer script
ah it's like a macam err I based err meaning ah I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same ah like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me lah ah who has studied in
um ah in semester three I was very low key nak mampus tau aku macam aku every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet uh I even like um tak post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key ah
ya and then this coming semester four pun err aku hopefully lah I can get a err very good lah but all in all aku cakap dengan kau I mean
I don't know I don't know lah macam but but you see ah I I remember that time ah aku baru balik dari kedah tau nak balik err pergi tak silap ke singapore uh
then aku dah eh macam mana kau tahu then she say oh I know lah because of your accent and the way you talk
aku dah wow I'm shocked man
talk betul betul betul
eh err you she she's a teacher in a she is she is a graduate from singapore eh tak silap aku eh no no no err no she's a she's a alumni of
but her brother actually err studies in and err did err did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl err so to cut the story short dia cakap dengan aku lah eh uh you kan orang melayu kenapa you tak stay kat malaysia err I think you should
err take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking eh apa dia cakap tu maybe there is a certain truth you know because kat sana aku perasan orang melayu wah babe privilege babe
macam privileged gila aku cakap privileged you know
yes yes yes exact bumiputera thing
yes yes betul betul betul then aku cakap lah eh but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then err aku cakap dengan dia lah I was very frank with her I told her err you know how kat sini kita
err macam casing kita punya bangsa kan macam tindaskan
err or we are being like extra lah kirakan not extra lah we're just being err we are we we we're looked down
tapi kat sana it's err it's bangsa dia orang yang look down kau faham kan so dia macam terbalik err macam dia err aku cakap dengan very frank ah then dia cakap ya I faham I faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat is not
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city lah but the expenses there is mahal nak mampus
I find like macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang the shampoo body shower oh wah I tell you mahal sangat macam satu
one body shower macam dove eh twenty four ringgit eh siala twenty four ringgit when you pay when you pay fifty ringgit to pay for the twenty four ringgit and when you left with that balance eh macam kiwak macam eh this is very expensive leh but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot kan then it's like worth it kan padahal it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether
I always thought like macam is quite cheap aku I when I go over to like macam kedah I go penang wah it's even cheaper sia barang-barang dia then I'm like I'm quite shocked lah in one way or another
and then err I mean I always got teased off lah I always got teased yang eh err by my classmate eh kau tak nak kahwin ke dengan orang malaysia
aku macam ah kahwin orang malaysia kau tahu tak aku punya preference apa
no I'm serious I mean I I have I have this classmate she's orang johor you know so she dia macam dia macam merajuk you know dengan aku because aku macam friend zone dia
no no no that one is another girl that one is another class that one is another department err that one is err sastera that one is my my my own classmate lah and then macam macam mana aku tak friend zone dia babe dia
dia she's from okay dia not very the feminine kind of girl oh dia macam very kasar then dia suara very loud and then dia very macam err like you you can sense a presence you know and then she's very she participate in every college activities
and then aku kalau aku betul-betul nak menghala kepada
ke jalan yang lurus and then my choice of girl is somewhat very feminine you know macam honestly like ya ya ya I mean yang orang yang pakai tudung yang very very very manis to look at I don't know ah that is my kind of preference ah when it comes to
ah sia aku macam siala I mean
ah syak kurang ajar lah tak lah but I don't know I mean I don't know you never know what you never know err our future like who knows maybe kau one day get married or aku one day get married you'll never know
but but innocence that macam aku punya preference when comes to I have I have a type of of of of lady of or a girl and yang aku suka lah and my preference is macam yang putih yang dia no need no dia tak perlu putih sangat it's just putih dia pakai tudung ke very very typically uh
eh aku tak hitam kita sawo kita sawo matang kulit kita is sawo matang
sawo matang tanned tanned sawo matang
so err ya so and then kurang ajar tak lah hitam is hitam and then after that um then aku kat sana aku kan macam abang-abang aku kan macam abang-abang singapore kan
ah ya ya ya you know my suara is always like hello
and then lagi suara aku ah my my voice will bounce apa whenever I use the mic when it comes to presentation err in lecture hall
so macam I'm known as the suara abang-abang lah but then dia orang tak tahu lah they akan close all
no I'm serious ah no aku dah macam aku cakap dengan kau aku macam double lives ah kat sana you know like
in school I am like quite err the abang-abang but
ah eh babe do you know that aku that time menang err did I did I show you a picture that I aku menang err prince of the night you know for for an event
macam ah so I I won like a prom kingish punya competition
I know it sounds crazy aku pun tak sangka and I was the host emcee for the event and and the judge was my lecturer so what he he he actually chose me as the prom king err or the prince of the night aku dah huh apa ni
no because um he chose me because I was I was one of the I was ultimately I was the only one who dressed very well that night aku ah because I was wearing blazer
ah ya I was I was wearing blazer then I bought this like yellow punya macam like a macam like a apa tu belt ke apa dah apa-apa lah and then I yellow err
I think ada I pun nak tunjuk you guys ah then so I was quite shocked lah so
so like err like err like I tell you like I I feel like I'm living a double life macam kat kat sekolah aku macam very quiet quiet baik-baik but
but at the same time aku aku kan quite wild kan like you know the number of people aku met aku err make friends with babe by in instagram by in facebook I'm still making friends up to today
I mean it's called networking lah although kawan aku yang kat singapore ni tak err I have I aku tak pernah disclose anything about it to do you know even that time I post err something about me going to kedah in my instagram
wei babe dia sampai err dia he actually
then lepas tu member dah sedih eh so dia dalam keadaan sakit dia dia boleh lagi sedih and aku dah macam eh kan kau dalam keadaan sakit kau boleh fikir yang aku nak macam
babe kalau
so macam ah you don't have to tell the other like I don't have to tell my friend lah because it's my prerogative apa
ya this my acts also apa so but
so I was like telling myself oh no no tak boleh aku dah I I cannot post this kind of err this kind of post anymore because he will be triggered eh ni nama ni triggered dia triggered gila dia triggered lepas tu dia triggered lepas tu dia start questioning me lah macam kau pergi dengan siapa and everything lepas tu dia dah start
ya then dia macam sedih lah dia dah sedih and everything aku dah eh siala ni member nak sedih
engkau ah kalau you see eh if you are sakit kau tak payah fikir tau benda begini you don't even have to think about all these all you think is about your preparation to meet
siap aku cakap dengan kau ah aku pun sometimes pun macam bila dia nak macam err intimate dengan aku aku sometimes pun I tried to elak you know because
berdosa kan kau orang tu tengah sakit lepas tu engkau kau engkau macam add onto ke fill onto his desire dia memang ada desire tu kita tak menafikan everyone has desire desire
but kena control lah aku pun cakap dengan dia eh you control lah you tak boleh terlalu on sangat leh because you never know ah in any bila kau orang cakap dia tengah kita tengah buat or kita tengah intimate sekali err tuhan tarik nyawa dia ke gila
in that kind of state ke you know because it's he's in that kind of that state state and then he's like he's super sensitive I mean at the end of the day in every situation err kalau tuhan nak tarik nyawa kau people err god would just take away your nyawa lah understood I mean
I'm trying my best to just keep up with my studies kita pun lagi tiga minute correct kalau you berapa minit babe kat situ
okay so aku pun tengah trying to keep up lah with my studies I mean I'm left with just err semester five six and seven so semester seven I'll be in here in singapore doing my internship
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia lah unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so err I did ask macam consulted over there lah like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like macam temporary contract eh
so aku tak nak ambil contract I aku rasa it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that kau kena cari err rumah then on top of that kau kena settle your visa and all those shenanigans so aku cakap no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
but you see ah the thing is I aku because I'm here mah so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so kalau kalau if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network lah and the end of the day aku pun tak sure lah what kind of err prospects I want to do
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the um I mean that's that's the thing that aku aku don't mind doing lah but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
punya sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe err
err take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day err in language pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa unless you are really passionate and interested in it lah
ah what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best lah but I'm just glad that my study punya period is going to be be done and over with very very soon

then after that um then after that he confess his feelings that's like okay ah I I mean can just okay then we keluar together
and then after that like I'm when I was relationship with him right I didn't felt like myself like I even like cause that time I was ready like after after uh secondary school then I during secondary school cause I wasn't wearing hijab fully what
then after that after secondary school I wanted to like legit wear hijab and not let guys see see my hair but then like he says that it's okay to see my hair
haikal now with another girl that time kat paya paya lebar kita nampak dia pe
siapa no she don't he don't have chinese girlfriend
with izzat I didn't even think about it at all but when we started obviously but when I was with afiq like he really like he really I mean about the bare necessities he really respected me like he didn't insist on like nak tengok rambut pay more runway or something the whole time he that one
is the ya but it's very apa oh ya ya but it's very rare to find cause all my exes like that one they don't care that kind of thing
then like dia kerja kat cafe
ya and dia kerja cafe sekarang actually I want to no but then it was very like he didn't even pandang orang bertudung
legit his friends know that about him and then he out of all his friends he he's the one who don't date much and then like ya and then he used to very mean before he met me like let's say he has a strong opinion again he will just blurt it out like and then if I even if you are good mates with him right he will just like straightforward say oh you're not doing your shit better do your shit now that kind of thing like but after he met me he became like better lah like he don't straightforward say because he try to jaga my hati at first he don't know how to jaga hati perempuan then I was like at first I was annoyed you know that one month when I started talking to him I actually wanted to stop talking to him you know
because I know then he will have like a strong opinion with it I started out slow then sometimes obviously I become mad then I tell him I mad at you he's like kenapa marah I was like I don't know you figure out yourself then he's like like it's the first time someone tell him that to him like then after that I think from there he start to take care of feelings more even his friends cakap that there is banyak difference from him dulu and sekarang ya which is good lah then after that from that like eh this guy is different like really really different from my exes
kau what about your exes
I think she want to elak I think she want to elak like to touch each other cause it's haram to do so
mira filzah the type kuat agama type what

like he made fun like cause there was this girl she's not wearing hijab but he can like sengaja see the sepender
after that he just say eh apa awak curi my sepender eh selama ni saya cari-cari tak dapat then everyone like ya I was so shock also cause like

naik motor
I know I know ya I know as in I like my parents know he then he will ask boleh tak naik motor with him
kalau pergi dekat-dekat yes kalau gi jauh-jauh no
ya lah in singapore lah I mean dekat or jauh like jurong
but obviously I will go senyap-senyap ah but afiq will say no tapi cause tanggungjawab besar like kalau apa-apa jadi kat aku dia kena ya
my poly friend faiz and hidayah the toxic that one dorang accident motor
ya then banyak sia kat perempuan tu then now dia back up she keep saying like I have a lot of scars so don't accept me
but then you know the that time I go out with my poly friend what then after that uh we were eating then my one of my cause we used to be a huge clique what then one of my other clique cause we split then that clique ask my friend like you want to lepak with that clique like while we were eating they know you know while we were together dia tanya gitu
um baik ah kau
kau eh
kan ah itu susah
ada pekik kan a'ah
um kat sekolah selalu kena check in check out temperature taking semua
tak suka ah
nak minum air pun susah kena keluarkan mask semua
macam lek bro lek bro cuma nak minum air
a'ah kena kena nak kena sepak muka
oh oh did I tell you about kat sekolah kat sekolah kan got this girl dia macam irritating gila babi tak tahu
a'ah dia macam bites off macam gitu you know
dia macam tengok aku macam stare stare macam gitu
tak ada tapi like I I cakap dengan dia like tapi her vibes macam really off lah like dia macam suspicious dia macam cakap dengan aku like one way then she will go out and then she will talk to someone else another way
okay tapi kan like
I felt very petty lah tapi like um what's another like do you have any like macam petty reason
you like don't like somebody even though like macam
just met ke atau
macam Tinder ke muslim match ke
but it makes sense because macam like if you going to get to know that person
and then they they are like the way their vibes macam tak link dengan kau so it's very weird of course of course you would say no
kau gen Z
ya semua semua online
like orang can find like what they need to know about you through online social media semua tu
if you going to use normal you going to use a different name itu kan catfish
okay kau betul kau betul
kalau age lain sikit macam um please remove remove ah kan I mean as long as you're over twenty one so it's
macam mana okay ya paedophiles out of the way
technically it's a podcast cerita malam punya podcast kan
ya I guess that's like a pet peeve kan macam orang like lie about their age basically they fake their personality
ini what pet story ke apa buat pet story
huh makan um
makan Maggi bro a'ah

macam perangai perangai dah change ah macam gitu
alamak so sweet nya
alah macam gitu pun boleh alah
kenapa monyet monkey lah
dia kepoh ah jer
I know lah tapi macam third party terdengar
that's mean tak baik sia
alright makes sense it's okay you want clarification just as in secondary school sekolah menengah
who are like there to like support you kan so macam like if you if you find like friends who are girls then macam they just want to like
befriend you so they can get to know like your best friend or something like that tu salah macam salah sikit
but I think like like the karma that's going to be served to me but kalau
tapi kan if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
dia cakap dengan aku like uh the way I
break up with people macam traumatising sikit
dia cakap macam sikit jer lah tapi
like revenge lucky revenge kan macam
oh okay for siapa
I will give karma back to him sia like macam
oh macam like he will say oh girls like perempuan tak boleh buat ni pe kena ada lelaki semua
ah ah ah ya ya ya macam gitu macam gitu tapi kan like I'm I feel macam
macam like you got nothing to prove
aku rasa because right I realise
if macam like
like some guys kan macam them they try to over like try to be overconfident
no because kan like kalau dorang macam like they get into a relationship with you then dia rasa macam okay
subconsciously dorang macam project their insecurities on to you
um does it's like whatever they are lacking then dorang macam insecure gila babi then they like ah macam mana I cannot
um tapi like confidence is good like in a person tapi macam tapi kan if you're like too overconfident then you are just macam hiding something then it should it like you're hiding something to the extent where you are actually projecting your insecurities on other people so please get therapy
please get therapy ya please get help because macam I macam I don't like the fact that macam some guys ada
because dorang macam live so macam insecure because of like maybe what somebody else cakap dengan them or like something that somebody criticise them or whatever and then suddenly they are like insecure for their entire life and then they like project it on to you and then now suddenly using that and then fuelling that anger and then they are like I'm angry at you because somebody said that I'm not tall enough something like that kan a'ah
I I I I will agree lah women are the same but I feel like macam like perempuan semua we are so like in tune with our own emotions then especially we will like in like a group of girls and then we're like very comfortable with each other which kita boleh blush out berbual banyak-banyak we can talk like this end to the other end like how we're doing in this conversation
macam podcast sia tak tau
I'm edgy I'm cool I'm so quiet oh my god macam sounds like me
um okay alah kesiannya oh no
even if you are just friends ke atau macam mata air semua you don't own anybody

two elders so gizmo's one of them and then like precious is the other one ya I feel like she will be low key macam
hidung tinggi a bit sombong sikit because she's very pretty she's very pretty
ya but tapi right I think she will be the macam queen bee very pretty tapi dia very macam
oh banyak sia
I got four other cats eh macam mana

nine nine nine abang polis
sorry ah dogs are a bit macam susah
you need to train them macam really train them because macam kalau for cats kan like they can be a certain way kat rumah
but but sometimes macam you go to the vet clinic then they macam ganas ke they like to scratch around is normal lah because they're not comfortable mah tapi kalau dia kat rumah they're very comfortable they're very loving macam is so easy for them to like
they're not like dogs dogs kan you need to macam train them properly like okay here is where sit or like here is where you poop pee whatever
a'ah the only time dorang macam very noisy is macam they belum sunat ah
a'ah belum sunat
ya ya ya when they belum sunat they macam like itchy then they cari cari mata air they cari lover so macam of course lah they very
but dogs dogs sometimes they just bark for no reason like kalau like if you have jin in your house like they would just bark
oh got one time when I was younger lah dulu-dulu macam primary school there was a
and then it broke through like one of their glass panels so it's ya it was like a there was like a macam
it's so tiny though I don't know it just like okay first macam it was already at the door then I was like okay

then suddenly all I hear is the dog barking and then suddenly he's at my ankles so I was like what do I do macam mana ni
cili padi ah
macam macam short people
but like of course these people who already got their doctorates from like nineteen fifty two dorang macam aiya I did it before you can confirm do one
ya but but right okay um so singapore always says like hi it's a very difficult time so like if you need if you need um help please go find it and then they like give you macam like all this like hotlines to call if you're having like anxiety having depression blah blah blah
that's why otherwise macam
bro tak boleh lek lek pe
kan macam like stop demonising tattoos or like macam or like piercings
macam it's very bland it's like macam you you masak ayam masak merah but there's no merah
ya so so can we can we bring it back um I mean it's not it's been taken out but can we bring it into the society where we can normalise ayam masak merah with the merah
you close your eyes tutup mata sudah
err just now the chinese lesson err was err was uh I was feeling very very tired uh sebab uh penat cause tadi pagi uh saya pergi ke sungei buloh nature reserves

err tak no I didn't I actually went yew tee then I bought err bought food for my family and then I went back to pass it to them yes
semalam uh semalam also you you went out did you keluar tak semalam
err semalam uh I spend like almost for the whole day at err I was studying for my studying for my exam for my finance exam so most of the time err kat kat lah belajar jer sampai from pukul satu sampai pukul enam gitu
ya I just study makan uh belajar makan belajar makan belajar makan ya uh
err uh actually I bought food from bukit batok bukit batok I didn't buy anything from cause macam nak macam nak save duit eh nak save duit kan so err I bought from a like a bukit batok store a store from bukit batok yang jual yang kat bawah that kind
ya so the food there macam nasi lemak nasi ayam is like uh macam murah-murah kat sana it's like dua setengah like one satu satu satu setengah gitu so macam very murah then harga dia harga dia murah so err kalau tak sedap tak apa lah ya so that's what I had for my lunch yesterday
mm kat mana it's like bukit the bukit batok one
dekat kan
apa err is it nice
err maybe macam dah lama tak makan burger king
I went out for dinner with someone so kita err we went to try out this cafe at jurong east um the new cafe ah so yesterday dia punya uh it was its opening day um I forget what is the cafe called lah ya but it's near err area that that that jurong east area ya so uh when the food macam uh it's boleh tahan lah macam
um not the best not the best decent decent food ah so I tried err fish and chips err I tried fish and chips and err order also mushroom soup ah so the fish and chips macam apa tu uh boleh tahan lah macam lebih baik kalau it's apa tu lebih garing eh lebih garing ah and dia punya apa tu dia punya dia punya flavour eh
err is not my taste lah not my taste ya then their their mushroom soup is fine err macam terlalu salty for me ya
no the taste macam masin ah masin salty ah so I had err this tea called strawberry mango tea which is err interesting it taste it's just not bad lah it smells not bad the tea is like any other tea but the smell is good
err just to try out new stuff lor like he's a foodie so macam uh just go go around try new halal food see if it's nice in singapore there is not much halal options right so you just want to see see macam just take a look see see eat eat a bit here and there
we shared the food because err the err he he ate in the morning like before he came out so macam he's trying to I think he's trying to like do a bit of weight loss also lah cause he quite big size ya
twenty four hours so there's also a drive through kan ya so we we just it's a drive through ya so we just uh we went there for awhile just to macam have a bit of dessert lah macam so we we ordered like err two mocha iced mocha latte
ya I suka
ya so it was it was not bad lah macam it's uh is a bit uh ex apa tu a bit mahal and a bit uh sweet ya sweet tapi just sit down there macam just to berbual-bual jer lah berbual-bual talk about stuff
kat mana like how much
oh I think it's the mi Maggi one right mi Maggi noodles
tak nampak benda-benda halus eh
a'ah seh now now like uh sekarang tengah hujan right uh it's hujan semenjak pukul lima empat setengah gitu ah kan ya tapi macam dah it has it looks like the rain has subsided a bit so I think there might be a chance that we can play badminton at six
actually the weather now is like the best cause like macam it's mendung it's cooling
ya mendung err a bit sejuk and it's just nice weather ah
ya it will be hard to play badminton when it's too windy lah ya and if it's too slippery because right now the tennis court is a bit err it's like it looks very wet basah cause of the hujan
which is what you want teleport
so the is like a sci-fi movie where err the story is about this err boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so err it happened err sebab one day dia macam apa tu he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so dia punya classmates I mean when the group macam ada
gangster gangster sikit ah ya so like even though they are very young the err they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time uh macam dia tengah lari tengah lari from the orang kan abeh um one of them from the bad guy actually tembak
tembak the the guy so he hit the side of his head ah ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone err in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid lah but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
err to actually um see whatever you're typing err whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related lah and he has the ability to macam technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like err if you think about it right macam there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool lah very cool
ya cuma macam now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others uh for others for his own good and to help others lah I mean macam so he helped to track down the the culprits ah so the story was err macam apa tu uh this uh the neighbourhood is macam ada apa eh
macam ada is run by this err drug drug society drug a group ah like err ya so he helped to track this group down abeh macam help the police to do so he he use his technology macam to draw them in lah to expose on the drugs and dark secrets dorang ada to the neighbourhood and to the police
orh no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts macam like err ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like err put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool lah ya
ya ke oh is it that's nice oh he more like he targets the the gangsters society but dia macam he let them uh like he drains all of their bank accounts so that dorang tak ada resources
orh err usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience err any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that macam
there's always like err well known stereotypes err within the malay community err for example macam one very good example would be macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai in math gitu ya from young so and usually like err because like orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat void deck gitu so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people lor in a sense ya
which I think err palsu lah because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it what it's the same for everyone cuma dulu is okay what to lepak cause like last time with your friends just chill chill lah like if if you like to me if your if your kind of lepak is main err like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of lepak is really like is at the void deck lah chit chat yang main guitar ya so is the same kind of lepak lah I mean is just different kind of how you view lepak as
even though I do agree that err there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but err to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to err macam public uni ah I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases macam after poly right they they err they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then macam if you look at err maritime studies kan err from poly err I think I got one friend yang macam he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship one
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose lah I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya macam gitu jer lah
lama eh it's very long
macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam eh
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools tapi when you talk about those non like err like we have certain schools in singapore yang macam the fees very expensive kan so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not err for those families yang macam tak boleh afford lah because the fees are very expensive even like um macam if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ah education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families yang macam or those like err families yang macam rumah tangga ada masalah uh mak bapa tak boleh beri uh tak boleh kasi apa tu uh apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada uh apa tu anak-anak mereka so I think this is where it will be nice lah if the err those families uh those kids um can
you do lah but some people just need err err a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like uh macam some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit uh of like resources a bit then they will start to see orh this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school lah so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards uh macam striving to to get a scholarship
but you have to eat other people for meals dahsyat seh
you go kerja is it
ni hari today I wake up then I never do anything sia like I wake up right I wake up quite early but I got no school today so like I don't know what I

she reply pun like after every two three days lah um ya
eh should I mandi
motor kuat bro
my father hantar me to school naik motor since like primary school
is gonna go and pergi mandi
mm pada pendapat saya
kalau boleh I want a fit body because err I suka main bola err football kan
so err kalau I'm more fit I can you know run faster err I can play better I can improve my performance ah in game
kan you tahu I main untuk err kelab bola
err dan
apa tu err
err I juga suka pergi gym I like
bila I go to gym I
of course kadangkala like of course everyone wants to have good looks lah you know you go out then if take photo with friends or what or like you know you want to get girlfriend all you need good looks what so err ya lah ya got pros and cons lah for both but
err mungkin I pick the fit body lah
mm yang tu betul juga err
going by that thought process kalau gitu mungkin I pun nak ah good looks ah sebab
err macam you kata pe good looks tu err semua genetics tapi fit body I can I can train you know I can work for it especially now we are young right so fit body is a bit easier to get lah you know then
err tapi bila dah tua err semua tu good looks semua
habis lah jadi
kalau long term
aku rasa fit body lebih penting lah sebab untuk err general health and well-being kan
illnesses you know heart problems diabetes ke apa
err kalau gitu
mungkin kan sekarang everyone err selalu cakap pasal err global warming ni global warming tu our climate change ke apa I mean you just look at our weather lah everyday also in the forecast also always wrong one they say rain won't rain will be so hot then kalau err hujan pun
can have sun sometimes then it's like macam air panas aje
so I feel like err humans will go extinct from like all these like global global warming factors lah err mungkin like slowly over time when the sea levels rise ke then all the you know kampung by the the seaside all will become flooded and stuff like that or like mungkin will have err
lebih banyak err natural disaster semua
tsunami ke gempa bumi ke
extinct mungkin kalau macam sekarang ada COVID kan tu virus
tu virus semua like
especially kalau tengok err kalau singapore okay lah sekarang itu case semua sudah fall a lot right
mungkin dia orang punya culture semua berbeza kan jadi
err mereka suka peluk semua kan jadi like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
ini dua faktor lah yang mungkin akan ah menyebabkan err we as humans to go extinct lah
you cakap pasal africa kan tadi aku ingat lah err kat sekolah we learn about econs right err they always talk about the income inequality increasing and all that like and then they talk about the millennium development goals then aku teringat lah pasal err err extreme hunger err yang disrupt disebabkan oleh poverty kan jadi
I feel mungkin that's another reason lah there could be the could be the factor or the the cause of like err humans slowly like the population reducing lah I'm not sure if you boleh sampai extinct semua tapi
err I feel like it could reduce their population a lot overtime if the let's say you know econs they teach us they measure by gini coefficient right if it keep increasing increasing the rich get richer yang miskin jadi lebih miskin then um
err all these err kind of err things like malnutrition all also can increase the diseases and all that because your immune system tak kuat kan jadi
the income inequality makin naik and the
ya lah so maybe the if the government don't do um anything to tolong kan the orang yang miskin orang yang
tak mampu then um
maybe lah this could be a factor that might contribute but mungkin err bukan main cause lah untuk err menyebabkan err apa tu err extinction of humans
skill tu you like do you mean like err
if that's the case right I mean maybe untuk saya lah err
I hope to be able to how to say macam like
boleh read people better lah
cause kalau gitu I can I boleh faham apa yang orang tengah fikir tu and I can like um
I err mungkin err bukan saja cara you cakap tapi err
mungkin err body language intonasi semua err
err ya lah itu like that's one of the first skill like I feel like err would be very beneficial lah and it's bukan satu skill yang senang untuk belajar pun it's like
lebih banyak confidence ah like especially um
dalam scenario macam public speaking depan err banyak orang
um like stage confidence lah not not just speaking you know maybe like anything in front of a large group of people lah but like err buat err presentation ke err nak buat acting ke err
anything that has to do with like err maybe a high pressure situation or err like situations with like other consequence kan macam like pertandingan bola ke where there's a there's a price at hand you you can you can dapat something lah you can win something at the end of the pertandingan ah so
like this kind of err situation where you tend to put pressure on yourself or a lot of people watching you like let's say ada coach yang tengah scouting err player yang err baru yang young talent semua
err I feel like it's it's a very useful skill lah next time bila nak kerja semua kalau boss aku err suruh err buat presentation depan err colleagues aku semua then you know if I have the confidence I after preparing all my things I can present well do a good presentation dia orang semua faham apa yang I nak cakap
then um kalau the third skill maybe err
like being more optimistic err positive fikiran semua err mindset
nak err aku nak yang
lebih ceria lah like I punya mood semua like
I feel like kalau any problem aku hadap
if I face it with like a a a positive mindset err kalau err as hard as it can be susah ke tak susah I can I can convince myself motivate myself to go through whatever struggles and skill ni penting cause it can help me to push through like let's say um
err gym kalau aku penat ke apa my next my next set I can just err keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind I focus on my goals and I just pursue them
besides gym lah like err bola ke like next time nak kerja ke anything in life like I I feel like ni ni benda ni confidence dengan yang positive tu err sangat penting lah but ia bukan skill yang
senang untuk err cultivate ini skill err mesti
ambil time yang lama lah mesti build up over time tapi kalau sekarang I boleh dapat ah tiga-tiga skill ni wah paling best ah
oh third one macam like err it's like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
apa-apa pun boleh lah
wah kalau free tu
tapi kalau gitu overlap macam skill kan bukan saja benda physical
sekarang sekarang benda yang high value kan yang kita kena bayar banyak
err let's say err gold ke or stocks yang property ke apa
bila you cakap free kan
free untuk kita sendiri ke free untuk semua orang
kalau gitu stocks lah kerana kalau I boleh dapat stocks yang banyak
I boleh jual I boleh dapat wang lagi yang banyak lepas tu I can just use it to spend on whatever I want lah whatever else I want because by then I'll be rich what
dia percuma untuk saya tapi untuk orang lain orang lain kena bayar jadi the value is still there but only for me is free so I can use this method to I can keep purchasing all these stocks especially now you look at tesla ni semua
err apa-apa lah yang err involve dengan benda teknologi
semua ni benda err dia punya stocks semua naik naik exponentially lah
if I boleh dapat ni benda semua I I can just you know err
then from there I can build up my wealth I can become rich boleh tolong keluarga saya kawan-kawan saya semua you know I can I can whatever that is material I can dapat dengan wang err I can I can have lah
like time is limited lah setiap hari tak ada dua puluh empat jam sahaja
I tahu lah kita tinggal di singapura ni singapore so small right they always say like you want to get to one side of the island to the other side is a short time only compared to other big countries but
kalau you boleh teleport you nak pergi kerja pergi sekolah you know you want to visit your friends family wherever in the world also
just having that additional satu dua jam setiap hari I mean it could be even more for some people because
you can get more sleep your tidur is good you err
your health pun lebih baik um
you know you nak err like
ada orang kan yang
dia orang err very stress at work or that they are they live very busy life all consumed by their work
but until dia orang takde masa untuk keluarga
tapi bila ada lebih masa ni you boleh spend time dengan keluarga ke girlfriend ke apa you know your family time is a is a very err important thing but I feel like in today's world is err is lacking lah because err people who are always in a rush no not enough time because of
travelling and all that you know like selalu kalau err jalan sesak traffic jam or accident hujan ke then you waste even more time lah so if you can teleport around you know I mean unrealistic lah but superpower right so if you can teleport around of course ideally not just yourself lah if other people also then you nak pergi holiday over the weekend pun boleh apa err so
you as a as a person your like whoever is around you lah cause you can teleport you yourself and then semua sama-sama pergi mana-mana pun boleh
are you more of a marvel fan atau you lebih suka
mungkin hulk lah kerana
dia tu like
he's still a normal human being lah but bila dia marah then then only dia transform kan jadi like
if I'm always having to be seen as the superhuman superhero with superpower then like I feel like the expectation terhadap diri saya akan it will be very high lah from everyone from myself all but if I can still be like a normal human being at the same time as being a superhero
tapi like as needed lah I can I can still possess
kalau you
untuk saya I feel like a lot of people like sebab I banyak training like
like err semua orang selalu label me as like err buff strong whatever
especially dulu bila bila eh err start of this year right when I had the shoulder err shoulder surgery and all that
whenever I am injured lah like not just the shoulder surgery actually like dulu I pun ada ankle sprain ni semua
I selalu err rasa macam
hati tersinggung sikit lah kerana like
um be at the level that high level of fitness um because everyone err selalu tengok saya macam
like bukan sahaja uh dari segi performance tapi like
bila I ganti baju pun kawan saya pun selalu kacau saya pasal err
badan saya lah jadi like if I feel like if I'm not on point at one point also like
as much as pressure tu tekanan tu
boleh tolong untuk err drive you motivate you tapi like if you don't know how to manage it you don't know how to handle it or you let's say you memang your mood
it can affect you sometimes and like it can pull you down even further lah you boleh cause itu macam apa tu dia orang panggil macam spiral
jadi susah sikit lah untuk you nak um
terukan aktiviti harian lah or your
because everything needs your willpower right like even you nak ganti baju nak pilih baju apa untuk pakai pun it takes you like some willpower to think about what you are going to do so like when you are lacking that willpower you memang bukan malas lah tapi like you really not feeling it like you just don't want to do any anything you nak just like
is it can become a real mood killer lah as much as like oh you think like err having this fit body like we said earlier lah tadi um
biasanya dilihat sebagai suatu label yang baik lah tapi
mungkin at times can be a bad label also lah I feel but
I feel like this is the paling paling common lah yang label yang semua kawan-kawan saya
dream occupation saya is err to be a physiotherapist kan so
also in five years six years time lepas uni depends on my situation lah if especially
kalau I masih single ke I dah attached because like if I have someone else then I have to
like err bukan sahaja keluarga tapi ni
I need to of course like devote some portion of my time to that person lah but okay err kalau kita assume tak ada orang tu I masih single I
masih tengah focus on my own goals
err lepas habis uni I'm probably be bonded to err one of the err government hospital kan
my work hours mungkin tak akan flexible sangat jadi
whatever free time yang I ada mungkin like
sekali seminggu lah I I will just contact my family and all then just check on them and then like um like how to say like
I I still go to the gym you know err kalau tak cukup masa maybe just a short workout lah empat puluh lima minit ke apa
you know and ideally would be of course with a with a friend lah cause kalau you train seorang-seorang pun err after a while it it kind of
could be a bit boring sometimes could be unmotivating and stuff tapi ideally if you have always have err
a training partner especially a training partner who selalu banyak tenaga banyak tenaga very like
energetic you know err selalu err give you a lot of vocal cues you know pushing you
bila dia spotting you kan then err I feel like that that would be ideal lah like this is the this is the minimum that I hope lah I just
um berharap like next time I I dapat macam work life balance lah orang cakap like
kerja pun I dapat dream job I I enjoy my work I boleh tolong orang like especially like if I can
become like a private sports err physiotherapist after I dah habis I punya bond dengan err hospital government hospital right and um
at that time I will look back and like I as an athlete like I did I sometimes and I need but like I tak tak cukup duit lah because this kind of service all can be quite expensive lah but I hope to be able to
tahap yang paling tinggi lah because like
bila dengan pertolongan daripada physiotherapy ni err you punya muscles semua like
boleh recover lah you punya recovery semua err lebih baik you you
jadi like
I tak dapat jadi I nak kasih orang lain untuk experience especially athlete athlete yang masih muda masih ada potential untuk
tak tahu lah mungkin boleh represent negara ke apa err ya like
that's that's the idealist scenario untuk saya lah like
bila I kerja pagi ke apa or mungkin I gym pagi err kerja sampai malam tengok lah then
but of course kalau I dah ada err orang lain dalam in my life lah like I have a girl then of course I need to you know like she'll probably be working also so
depending on our schedule lah but I will try of course try my best to make time for her you know maybe sekali seminggu just like we go out for like a date night or something like that just to maintain the relationship lah cause I feel like it's
kasih you punya masa kena sacrifice sikit lah untuk dia cause um
oh ya cakap pasal itu I forgot one of my passions is also to
err kayuh basikal lah jadi like
ideally if if my my working hours pendek sikit um
I boleh slot in masa untuk err girlfriend masa untuk err gym tapi juga untuk err cycling lah and
paling best kalau I ada satu kumpulan cycling macam like a cycling bukan maybe not like a very professional team like just like a cycling group lah then
like every maybe bila tak panas lah maybe
early morning ke err lewat malam ke then
we just you know ride around singapore together road cycling ah road cycling bukan err trail riding
dia memastikan yang I masih aktif lah bila I dah tua nanti
kerana gym mungkin after some time like bila dah tua err apa tu
you punya joints semua mungkin ada another problem lah tapi cycling
err dia punya risks tu rasa kurang sikit lah
you you ride a bike on the main road or jalan raya kan
I feel like err asalkan you it could err ikut peraturan jalan raya semua you follow the rules you just play safe lah you are you pakai lights all you are well seen and especially if you ride in group lah is safer cause you can or like look out for one another and you
I bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa I just like for casual for enjoyment like
untuk err general health and well-being sahaja lah but
it's a fun way lah for me untuk untuk dapat kan err
kerana gym
you punya cardiovascular health you punya jantung semua tu tak akan um
won't be trained as much lah tapi kalau nak buat cycling ke untuk you lari ke apa your
your this apa cardiovascular health will err naik ah you will improve boleh maintain semua
jadi um
err in the long run lah is aku rasa suatu yang penting tapi mungkin
err tak boleh dilakukan tapi kalau ideal scenario I nak lah kerana
each ride will take about what dua jam
so it's it's quite time consuming the sense cause kalau gym empat puluh minit you know you go in go out get it done
it's it's it's okay lah but err kalau cycling you kena gear up semua you
jumpa kawan and then you go for your ride it it takes a while lah and mungkin along the way sometimes we have like a pit stop just for coffee or whatever break you know just some minum slight makan just snacks then

powerful LOL eh tahu lah kita kan dah kawan dah berapa lama of course kau ingat gila tak ingat aku pun ingat kau nya kau kau suka normal jer kan
a lot of things ya a lot of things changed lah I mean um I mean my habits and err routines banyak dah tukar ya so especially sekarang kena work from home so that sort of things that you have to adapt to yourself ya
so so nak tanya sikit so you rasa this COVID right have err actually changed you to be a better person ke you rasa macam COVID is such a you know is making your life difficult
ya the good thing now you boleh spend time dengan parents you kan like you know more more time to get home you know daripada keluar because there's not much to do outside and and you cannot kita tak boleh travel so there's a lot of restrictions going on ya
so sekarang you have a new skill lah you the pro lah kan when it comes to like designing
boleh buat poster lah ni you know like marketing advertising okay not bad uh that's interesting okay
yes ya last time I feel like err it's such a waste I'm repaying every month untuk for netflix then sekarang macam it's a good thing I'm subscribing it and I'm utilizing the
ya or probably do some activities like err cycling you know ya probably I mean err tentative now the weather has you know ah you tahu lah kan weather dia sekarang nak hujan
hujan sekejap you know panas so I'm not sure if cycling is a good activity to do this weekend but it's just err tentative plan
oh really dekat dekat town is it bali lane okay
I should I should try ah I should pergi and you know mesti mesti weekends long queue kan and there's a lot of um
jadi dia tak macam ya they block the seats lah okay
okay true tak tahu eh sekarang ada movie apa yang best I mean dah lama juga tak check online usually now because we prefer to watch it online jadi um for us to go physically to the cinema macam
cause you punya orang suka advance planning is it ya and also you kerja shift kan and also pasal your um off days
I I I also prefer um cause I have a schedule so I actually like it when um someone make plans in advance so macam teratur sikit your you know your week for the week so ya
kalau orang buat advance planning err
kalau orang buat advance planning and then err you know suddenly they screw up or they couldn't make it and especially kalau kita plan big um occasions or err you know like err birthday parties or anything then lepas tu cancel it will be very hard you know
I mean if if you don't like something you upfront about it err you know I mean if you keep it to yourself then I I somewhat later I I found out about it I'll be very marah you know I'll be like very angry or like why are you not honest kenapa you tak just you know admit things that you you don't like
so that's one thing that I'm very particular about like err because like maybe it's not a good thing kalau you terlalu upfront atau terlalu honest but I believe that if you don't like something ya
ya because I I don't want to like keep things and then you simpan or kalau let's say you marah and then you you keep things to yourself then
uh but you you still not happy about it so you you know macam it doesn't goes well you know I really prefer ya to be honest and let it out about your feelings
so that um you know there's no macam terasa hati that kind of thing
ya lama kenal and then still keep in touch with err it use to be my primary school friend but then as we
instagram or social media ya because err most most of them are married with kids so macam they're busy dengan activity dia orang while
for me like you know I'm still I'm single so it's like I have more time so nak ajak dia orang keluar semua susah so now the best way is to communicate through social media
that's good that's good okay ya that I mean even though um you know tak boleh jumpa and all but the best thing is like at least keep in touch keep in contact tanya khabar you know that's a very good thing
uh ya macam mana you tahu
um playing on my err playlist these few months ever since err COVID has been you know going on so I discover new music um suka um I if I I like one music maybe I'll play a couple of times kalau suka the same music then I'll just have the same
tengah hujan but I know that you are the opposite right you suka loud music kan you don't like macam cooling cooling
for someone who's introvert then suka loud music ya
instrumental as in ada orang nyanyi ke is there anyone singing the music or just the playing instrument
ah tu itu kalau untuk tidur best eh
so I dengar by the way err you recently just start up a small business
kan uh macam yang
oh okay uh apa tu what's that
so macam mana you dapat the idea of um starting up that um small business of yours
so err berapa lama you dah you know venture into this small business
ya betul true
so um now that um you dah venture this err for the trial semua for three months so err what are some of the obstacles that err you actually face throughout macam err susah that you had to struggle along the way just for this business is there anything
actually this is a really a from what I heard from you punya explanation tadi kan I think this is such a good um way you know to to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you
to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you doing this alone or you ada team lain macam
that's good so but but then you are they're also working full time right dia orang pun kerja
mm if you're if you are talking about business um ya there's a few things err on my mind yang I lama lah actually plan out you know like one of them was like doing a set up leather sandals you know that I was planning to create a project err to help you know to actually um
kind of like support um like err you know small err other businesses that can help me to err create a a leather sandal so at the same time I'm supporting them and at the same time they are also helping me err to create err the leather sandals as per what I request yang I suka
err tapi at the same time err that this project is like the money will be going to err those in need is not for my own profit that's one of the project yang I tengah tengok
but then sebab sekarang tengah pandemic so I um um venture out and actually look at the quality and all to um the stuff
err I need to be kat sana physically to be there you know so it's kind of hard to communicate through ya on the phone so that kind of project I need to put on hold dulu lah so I tak boleh I cannot err
through err communication through err whatsapp pun it's very hard cause everything will be sent through pictures and you pun touch the material the quality ya so all these macam err I don't know like pandemic has um kind of like err stop err a lot of um my plans you know ya
so I'm trying to be as positive as possible hoping that maybe next year things will get better for us you know kita boleh travel and
and you know err the economy pun kat other countries err affected kan like err because we have been travelling to support like
other countries you know to to support um you know when as we travel um like like for example malaysia kita semua pergi err to buy things ya all this now sekarang kita tak boleh we cannot go over
mahal ya and everything kind of like limited if you notice macam sometimes you nak look at look out for your stuff tapi dah habis ya people tend to stock up a lot
all this like macam kind of like err a bit difficult for us to travel around and um to look out for things that macam susah nak dapat you know nowadays cause everything um macam senang aje is very easy err to to sold out so you have to
err you know order online you know get it from other country purchase kat you know from other countries and err get it delivered here in singapore so this is like kind of a big challenge but at the same time it makes us you know um be stronger as err you know as a country as a as together
so anyway err okay let me ask you something okay kalau sekiranya
kalau sekiranya err um flight dah buka lah the the the the plane is you can start to buy tickets to go anywhere so the first thing you nak pergi where would you want to go in your mind what's in the first thing on your mind
really you nak pergi morocco
macam dah lama lah it it's on your mind that you want to
oh you dah pergi you have been to norway so you went
kalau macam new zealand ke you know that kind of place orang selalu buat road trip kan you know like new zealand australia that kind of place orang selalu might sewa like err rent a caravan kan or
or do some road trip and um do some macam camping camping punya style lah kan compared to it's not a city vibes punya kind of
so it kalau macam gini you cannot err bring your parents lah kan do you think it's a good place to bring like elderly
ya and also like macam accessibility into halal you know the the food all and
um places to macam err to go to toilet all these kind of things you have to consider because maybe err the elderly might not err err feel that err comfort they they won't feel comfortable to to you know
stay imagine like you know when when you bring your parents to stay in a caravan kind of vibe I tak rasa they might you know they will like it because it's um something new tapi untuk dia orang nak masak ke nak makan they have their own preference kan kalau you notice
because I've experienced before macam err even though my mum is um she likes to travel juga lah kan she's okay with thing we can see that at the end of the day
she will still bring her like macam food lah she's not open to try the food from other countries she will still bring like macam maggi or whatever that is from singapore itself
or macam sambal you know err her own comfort food lah dia still akan prefer that compared to macam to venture out and try all the different kinds of err
food from the country that we are heading to so dia tak akan really macam kalau makan pun sikit aje
just a bit so dia tak akan macam into it
so kalau for me myself when I travel I would love to
ya correct that's why like they always pair err apa on standby they will bring err like sambal on the go you know to correct ya
ya interesting cause we err we get to you know like when you travel with your friends and when you travel with your err family or parents the the experience is different because maybe uh there's a lot of things that macam
might occur you know like um how the pace of how you want to travel the places you nak pergi you kena consider maybe parents not you know not okay with the places that you nak pergi tapi kalau dengan friends you are more flexible there's lot of things that you can do together
ya so macam it it it's something um you know sometimes when I nak travel pun I will consider like should I bring my mum along or um okay lah tempat ni maybe I err just bring my friends you know because of the places that I want to go back but maybe my mum would not um
see the volcano err dekat indo something kan nak naik err the gunung but my mum say that oh tak boleh it's very dangerous you know but my friends will be like hey that's interesting you know ya but we check all the safety precautions err precautions and such tapi my mum will still think that tak boleh you know
ya true ya ya semua tanggung dengan parents
okay um I just love snow okay I suka winter even though
good experience for me to err to finally dapat rasa you know how how it feels like because before this I've never been to any western countries and yang ke mana-mana yang ada snow
so bila I dapat experience snow tu I was like a bit jakun lah then I was like a bit like wow snow and then err at one point I was like okay it's getting too cold ya the the weather was so bad sampai negative the temperature was really bad ya but um
suddenly I was like okay I I cannot stand it I was like okay I'm so glad that um you know I'm staying in singapore cause singapore panas pun panas but I don't have to suffer compared when I was in sejuk dia macam one kind ya
but um still I I suka snow because of I can main I can play with the snow and then err and then the the the season like the vibes um
winter is like towards end of the month I mean end of the year sorry err so dia macam the feeling dia to christmas lagi-lagi macam so you build a snowman you know all these kind of things so I I to be honest even until now
cause like winter kan that's when the only time you boleh pakai thick jackets and then you can
you know you can wear like all the pullovers yang all the seluar kat singapore you tak boleh you know you cannot wear them so this is like a good I always think that way like this is like a good time for me to wear all the boots you know during winter
look different ya but then um ya kind of like waste after that I don't know what to do with the my my all all my jackets semua I tak tahu
it's not appropriate to be to be worn here ya so but now the worst thing is err pandemic so plus points still cannot travel so all these um jackets I'm not sure what should I do with it like should I jual ke you know
or should I buang you know ya
I would really err want to I really nak one thing that I really nak pergi after this err one place sorry err would be japan ya
I've been trying to err but then I heard a lot of things like macam mahal juga lah their their you know like to travel I don't I'm not sure maybe bila pergi japan you pernah pergi kan
korea dengan japan ada ada beza tak what do you think
I think we singaporeans kena belajar eh from them basic manners
I just want to try the train kalau to get to experience dekat japan you know like where the they have bullet train ya bullet train ya
ya I I heard a lot about err pasal japan and the culture and the food and I mean I I heard good food err I mean um that japan has a lot of good food tapi macam when it comes to the
price wise and to travel I heard like it's quite costly but I really want to visit tokyo though like um ya macam tokyo is like one of my destinations that I've been wanting to to to go
maybe next time maybe you can bring me since you dah pernah pergi err japan kan
last time kita tak appreciate err buat travelling kan kita selalu err feel that okay anytime boleh pergi you know next time lah next year but then sekarang when it's really like macam stop us from travel
the feeling is like macam oh all these while especially kalau pasal gambar macam like let's say kita dah frequent pergi that country
ah tak payah lah ambil gambar ah tak payah pergi you know then all these memories macam oh no it's wasted macam sayangnya kalau tahu aku ambil gambar that kind of thing
anything that you nak tanya I
afraid of insect does it count you know even like the small thing small insect like err small spider or semut sometimes I can be like you know
I I tak nak pegang I don't want to I don't want to kill it tak tak nak you know even though kita pakai tissue to throw it to angkat kan ya I'll be like tak nak you know just scared
cicak you know like lizards all these ya
I think it's it's stupid lah because orang cakap like dah mati apa for example especially when it's dead kan then dah mati apa so like just just angkat lah but I still like no I got that fear and
because maybe because um kalau you naik plane then kan ada clouds like covering so you tak nampak tau bawah sangat
and you are in a macam covered closed like you're inside the plane what so tak you tak exposed sangat you know to look down tapi kalau let's say it's a
macam you nak kena jump from a high a high building or something err you have to look down kan so probably for me I'll be very scared to do that but I guess you are you're not right from the way I look at you I think you are adventurous
actually err when I was in hong-kong kan I was scared of cable car ya sorry that was side track err I was in hong-kong so err I naik this err cable car tau you know the three hundred sixty so it's like full glass
so it's err so you boleh nampak bawah your kaki can look through kat bawah so I thought that it's just a normal cable car impossible that I'll be scared naik cable car biasa boleh apa but then when I took the three hundred sixty cable car it was like
you kind of distract because you can see everything so it's all clear and you feel that you going to macam jatuh the feeling
so I guess ya even you naik luge kan you kan dia macam open luge as in the apa yang the skyride tu yang dekat sentosa
ah ya correct that one itu pun macam open apa ya your legs dangling so macam
that one also I won't dare to macam ambil ambil video ambil gambar cause I scared that you know it might drop
so ya so my afraid of heights thing macam is kind of critical ah I feel tapi orang cakap it's quite silly lah but to me it's like it's something that I'm scared tapi orang lain probably they they find it like it's just heights you know
oh so where where did the spider tu apa lari then pergi somewhere like left or you had to kill it you kena bunuh
actually is is that the spider yang you tahu kaki dia like tipis ke ke dia
tapi kan ada kaki yang spider yang tipis ada yang very
I'm so glad like macam kalau singapore tak you you know tak macam sangat lah you know masuk spider but then if you are in kalau macam summer um season that's when the spiders um start to appear in in your house
so they start to masuk because maybe I think it's a it's a great weather to be in but
kalau let's say for example I suruh you err go and pick up a cockroach yang dah mati you boleh lah just use your bare hands angkat macam gitu
just like that angkat kaki dia ke orang boleh you know just
ee antenna okay I mean you boleh angkat macam gitu with your bare hands oh no
speaking of insects kan so err what do you think about orang-orang yang err actually eat eat insects like what what do you think like err is it okay to if let's say someone were to ask you to eat you boleh ke makan cambodian for example they ya they are like kind of into insects
so they it's it's not the same as where you found the insect outside you know macam it's not the the same kind of insect so they kind of clean and I don't know lah what where they found those kind of insect
only if they actually boil it first so it like it it it can macam at least the texture of the the dia punya shell macam edible I don't I don't know how they do it because
pork is part of their you know macam culture they like to eat ya
but I know I can see that you are an android user you pakai samsung so that's so how do how do you what do you think about um samsung
front camera ke atau yang back the back camera
dia punya music dia kan
ya ada yang baru punya you know the the flip phone is it err samsung ya I I saw that it looks kind of cool you know you can just
flip your phone and then like very compact you boleh letak dalam bag you what do you think of that
the middle part tu lah the screen punya macam
quite a lot for iphone you know and then bila they they start to have like ah tak ada charger err you have to buy different kind of you know the the cable now is like a bit different right if you notice kalau you tengok dia punya
bahagian at the top part I think it's different I mean I mean not the top part but as in maybe the the the charge itself I can see the difference with the old err ya the cable wire ya so it's like um
ya ya correct correct so you nak beli the head tu you kena beli a specific a different one ya anyway it's been a great time I got to go you know err I need to you know I'll get back to work so it's it's been a nice time to catch up with you err so kalau nanti free you just
hey sorry I know I came I'm supposed to come like an hour earlier but I came timing gini
yeah tapi like luckily I got like direct bus ah I mean it's a long bus ride but it was a nice long bus rides
yeah macam
like forty minutes then like I was thinking to myself like shall I take a train or what then macam like
suprisingly ada eh cause macam like apa
newton or something then I have to keep like tukar tukar actually no like last year I at dhoby right and like my line is the green line then I have to keep like switching and stuff
yeah I feel like I mean like I understand that we have to wear the mask and stuff tapi like
macam so leceh you know like I'm still so
yeah I was supposed to go for like two concerts this year you know I was supposed to go for yungblud and rex orange county tapi like COVID
mm begitu lah nak buat apa kan
apparently like supposedly my ah first ah music festival lah kirakan so macam like excited kan
habis COVID habis like pun tak boleh masuk I really miss you know I want to go like
you know makan sate malam malam
murah and it's like so nice to
then like she sell err she her husband sold those like bakso cuts you know
and because of COVID cafe dah tutup seh then macam like we feel very bad because it's like
she's kind of like she lives in a kampung right then she just like gave birth and then like
tak ada duit like the only source of income was like
from her husband then macam like baby tak ada duit then the other time
we called her during raya the baby tengah demam seh
like mum's siblings and stuff cause we like kita like very rapat dengan dia
bila raya right like dia orang tak boleh keluar negeri you know like I mean
if they live in you have to stay in then after that like you like for raya you cannot balik kampung which is like
their bandar is right so like their family members are all back in like kampungs and stuff
yeah that's not the case but I think I mean like I think it's also just because uh during like hari raya like that time
like try to leave by car right and then like there were like the police or something that dress up like pocong just for them to go home
yeah like you know the police or some volunteers lah you know macam they dress up macam pocong gitu habis just to like
scare cause like malam malam kan dekat
dekat hutan semua tu so macam like it scared them and then like
patah balik sia I got see a video of it it was kind of funny
I think they did tried to do the same kat indonesia also during like the whole lock down thing but then
why I mean like yeah I mean like I think in singapore it's not too bad like compared to like maybe in the west gitu
it's all pakai laptop eh
like you pakai laptop then like it's just what like
sometimes when I'm doing my work and she's just my mum's always at home just like kenapa tak buat
you know like kenapa tak buat
err tak tak tak tolong mak or something like that you know so I'm just like
I told you kan like the day before I pergi err the malayan council
then err you know portion dia orang kan besar kan so like I couldn't finish it so I brought home
like you know I cannot finish and I don't want to throw it away because like mahal kan
then uh he's like okay so I just met him and then like kita lepak
sekejap I got screened by an officer at like that hour I thought like I also like to panjat you know cause like
also then after that like at night I went to like jumpa kawan you know just to lepak also
I don't know there's this thing called the the rendang daging salai or something
it taste like you know the kuah is sort of like rendang then with linguine with like scallops
sotong and then there's like daging salai on top lah which is like I don't know
really sedap lah it's like a taste of like you know you I feel like a lot of fusion foods don't really work out tapi for them is like for western and malay food to work it's like
yeah I mean like I'm not sure about rendang being the nicest but
tak sedap you know everything is sedap
no I mean like I I'm fine with it but if it's like a weekday cause macam like tak ramai orang
so macam especially with the whole COVID thing I pun like a bit paranoid you know there's like so many people
cause like I don't mind like paying for that price cause like it's sedap you know and then like
pre pre COVID lah they like to give us like free stuff like for example like free cake or like sometimes they give free mussels gitu
I mean it is arab street lah everything there is like mahal and yeah it's a once in a while thing so
ayam madura which is like oh yeah
ayam geprek you know something like that like very indonesian based
but it's just a bit leceh cause like arab street and some of like it's in the middle of the road
I don't know I use you know like kat Telegram they have those macam groups kan then macam
you know they mention things like for example like oh they never mentioned the pay like berapa or just like
oh you have to go through this course first and we won't pay you for it and stuff and then macam like
benda gini all should be like you know when you advertise it should like it should be there what
habis dia orang tak ni so I was just like
yeah and then it's like macam cause like sometimes like
at least tak payah you know terfikir fikir you know kalau dapat ke tak
don't tell you the full truth then macam like I feel so cheated by it if I'm being honest
akan lama gini you know
cause like I thought like when it first came to singapore I'm like okay lah macam
but I thought like okay lah like lama lama pun maybe by the end of august or something but look it's september and it's still the same thing
and at most apa apa boleh makan kat luar jer tapi still need to wear mask and then like I'm just like
so that stupid idiot of a president cakap kan like
like the president cakap lah and then the next day
really ada orang ni seh like actually drank bleach and stuff
mm tapi macam like a bit
that this like donald trump like macam dia punya priorities is just not
which was so bad cause like you know like it was already tengah COVID
so I feel so macam kasihan for them lah that they have such a bad president like this
common at all you know like so kasihan huh
hey that's not bad I mean like no offence lah but for an average melayu you know it's
okay lah like you know you cannot expect much from orang melayu lah honestly sorry but yeah
you know reciprocate also it's a bit like sakit hati
kau tahu macam boring seh like
cakap lah benda interesting you know I received a joke once like
cinta like I that time like during I was on like dating apps like
like it's always the girl that has to like initiate dulu ah
habis like macam for a girl I don't know how it works but I believe
from the second you match ada like
dua puluh empat jam for you to uh respond then like
no I think it's macam like concept baru because macam like typically it's always like the guys that have to like
like wipey mat melayu sort of things like you'll actually find like
so macam
err there's I find more like foreigners there and stuff tapi now I don't know lah I mean like cause
cause like Din Tai Fung sana kan halal right so like I want to give it a try but like
never got the chance to like I normally every year always naik like with my family
it just became like an unknown tradition then this year tak dapat pergi it feels so weird you know cause like
normally when I go to I get very like jelak because it's like there's not really much to do besides like you know chill
tapi like
this year tak dapat pergi it's just like I want to go back
I thought halal tapi tak halal then after that I tried in malaysia and like I'm just like I'm so in love I can't believe this is not halal in singapore
but I was from a wedding tu I like
I came in like my kebaya so it's kind of funny but then at the same time like I think it's kind of normal
me and my cousins all nak cabut because like
cousins so it's like rapat but
not very rapat
going for like jemputans and stuff like that pasal macam like when growing up gitu
macam I don't know I'm like very rimas cause macam panas kan then you have to like dress up semua and then like
pergi ah wedding tapi tak kenal siapa you know then macam I
told my parents I said like yeah I'm not going to go anymore tapi I do enjoy if it's like
then you talking about the biryani like I think it's always a star of the show right then um
satu kali that time uh my my aunt I think
just I just decided to go lah because like macam I was I I know her what
then she kahwin
the biryani was just like next level
so like tak payah makan for the rest of the day
and then like sometimes they always like kasi kita bawa balik then like got the ayam masak merah then the nasi minyak and all that
okay okay nasi biryani would be the first one I think of then next will probably be like nasi minyak
then like rendang and ayam masak merah that is like the three I mean that's like the staples I mean then maybe like
like from ah um you know ikan tiga rasa like you know the crispy fish and stuff like that
other than that I feel like what else is not like why wouldn't there be biryani and stuff like that's so weird
who like got married like during like the second week of raya and I feel like
you know it's your wedding right go ahead but I very pantang you know cause I feel like I'm from a
then like to have a wedding macam like no offence ah tapi macam like spoil seh
then might as well don't do a big wedding right just kahwin like or something you know
I mean like why why do people do it buat penat jer cause like normally like
people are just more tired during ramadhan you know and then like
kejar maghrib and stuff like that just to eat with their family then like you know there's terawih and stuff like that I think this
ah tapi I
ah I think recently they uh naikkan to maybe I think fifty
I I mean like the idea of it being small it's like okay I get it you know like small wedding then macam bigger honeymoon lah kirakan tapi macam
I'm also like the first child right so macam I feel like I understand my parents point macam dia nak you know show us off or something
and then also like personally I feel like I have a lot of friends too and I feel like you know kalau tak
invite satu like if I invite like sikit sikit tu I don't want like dia orang sakit hati ke apa
tengok lah macam mana if anything also just like kahwin sikit sikit then like you know like
you know so macam like a lot of like the kampung kampung roots are still in within my family
so macam like a lot of things I do is still very traditional like personally I would still want that whole
you know macam gantry thing like you know you have to like fight your way to get in to see the bride and then like the whole
silat thing I think I I it's just for traditional purposes you know but then like
if I were to get married in future you know it's like I pengantin apa like it's like I will be pengantin once in my life only what so macam like
actually I don't want to I don't want do it under the block though cause personally I just feel like panas cause like
like you can still house like a lot of people and stuff and also like I'm pretty sure there's a playground nearby so like budak kecil all can like run around
first daughter you know I mean like this sounds super geli and it's so merepek cause like considering I'm only like ninety right but like
you know macam like considering like the financial and stuff like that like is it like worth
I thought about it like australia is a bit too near I mean like it's not to near it's more of like dah banyak
singaporeans there's banyak asians then like you know the whole like kiasu thing going on
so I think to myself just like you know okay lah then mat salleh at least I know I got chance to be the top right tapi like
dengan asians maybe not you know so I I've always thought like maybe I want to
nak migrate like like you said lah with the whole like tradition
uh like you know it's like very like new like you dah biasa with the whole family gathering then I thought about it like
like I've also been called like celup lah like back in secondary school like I couldn't do malay at all you know
she wants to pass down her malay down because she said I don't trust you dengan your melayu
gitu but I feel like if I think about it if I ever get married to a malay guy he like one requirement is that he has to speak better malay than I am because I
no lah I feel like it's also important cause macam like it's just like your self identity juga apa then like
I feel like at least in singapore also macam like the malay community is like
rapidly macam the language is dying you know I feel like
personally because macam like okay lah like if you were to
make me like you know sit in a malay class in malay in bahasa err in malaysia or something I feel like even the top scorer of my malay class
it's just different lah macam like melayu sini the standard macam lower you know then macam a lot of people like just
dah tak tahu pakai like they don't really speak
then also macam like some of them like don't even know how to cakap you know
so yeah lah then like macam a lot of like little like ah traditional things are like dying too
like macam like anyam ketupat you know macam like
my family ah bila raya we still make it a thing lah macam every year we still do it you know and it's like
sedih ah because it's like you know I grew up with such like memorable err like memory ah you know with a lot of like memorable stuff from the first day of raya and I feel like for me
holidays just like I mean like hari raya and all like becomes like less enjoyable I always enjoy getting ready you know like
the whole you know buat kuih raya and like ayam ketupat and like just like getting already getting the house like raya ready
macam best ah like you know but like
then ya then anisa pun
I come late also lah cause dia kata dia nak datang pukul tujuh eh tak tak tak dia di

one hour one hour terus dah dapat
I tak perlu upload gambar sendiri
then what if like the person dah kahwin then lepas tu ada masih orang nak try hit on the person
menarik oh god
oh it's like didn't see lah cause like your apa tak nampak apa-apa pun kan
eh then you know the Instagram what's that filter where they have their halal meter or haram meter thingy
oh cause like someone told me one of these dating apps they have this halal haram ratio or something
we have been wanting to do it just for the loves ke
to go but then I always feel bad because you like you say orang kat Muzmatch macam dia orang serious
ya it does oh ya about apa yang you said
how do you feel about that isn't that like a dating app but then macam physical

oh kan apa ada some cerita-cerita cinta pasal
where the parents just like apa pair them pair their children up then like they their children won't know each other and and don't see each other until like the day before the engagement or something

nah ah just say they macam I wouldn't want I know that through all these apa
bodoh apa-apa apa-apa sebab oh multiculturalism at its best
then I saw one uh caption uh bukan caption ah macam post
dia cakap pasal the politics then I think it was about this
uh like it's so sad macam because of all this kind of things it's just some disagreements
uh kadang dia orang tak sedar diri tau
macam sedih lah macam what can you do also
tak kadang dia orang akan suddenly berbual pasal the privilege that we have for example the Mendaki thing and the education stuff
mm kenapa orang chinese tak percaya ah macam
ya kan orang-orang chinese tak faham lah
then lepas tu dia orang kata apa
hidup dalam susah hati ini dalam negara ini
ya that's the thing like everybody keep telling me like apa macam eh kita orang sepatutnya macam bersyukur lah sebab
kita orang tinggal dekat singapore singapore bagus ada orang jaga ada orang kasi kita orang solat ya ke dia orang kasi kita pakai tudung dia orang tak we don't die just because we are muslims they we don't get shoot just because we are muslims
entah lah
kelakar eh tadi berbual pasal dating abeh tak pasal-pasal berbual pasal politics pula

tak tak hendak tak apa lah just get over eat I just get over eat
other house on TikTok and stuff and they've been doing macam ni
mm mungkin dia orang pun macam nak
ah tapi ada satu macam
macam quite I don't I don't really like it like they have this challenge on their on their house opening I was like
entah macam ada beberapa challenge
oh tak there is one challenge that I like
is was like um calling my um my girlfriend or wife a third name lah I think that's quite cute actually I like that one but some other challenge macam questionable
tak tak she doesn't follow me anymore yeah tak nak kecoh sia
and then his pelamin is so pretty I love it
kat luar some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I kaypoh kaypoh tanya dia kat mana
takde any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then orang akan marah and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the pelamin ah you'll see the bride
dengan dress dia lagi
oh my god I was thinking of that tetapi kan tetapi eh tapi kan macam singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that
that macam abeh tengok sunset kalau sunset dia lawa oof lagi best then kita boleh tengok sunset sama-sama
like the whole family tengok sama-sama
then macam at the same time I'm scared like hujan tempias even if there's like shelter ya and confirm mahal seh ya would you want to spend so much
like I want a small majlis jer
tapi nanti orang sedih nanti macam baiklah
like I really hope if I end up getting married macam the

but to be honest it's really very taxing because it's like you have to be there from like morning eight thirty usually lah my daily my daily apa err daily timetable will be like lapan setengah eight thirty then
kalau at most pun I will end about what five six kau imagine kau duduk in front of the screen for that one whole day
ya because for me kan aku macam
aku pun I I love to be honest I love to be at home but like to be at home
eh kau tahu tak actually kan sekarang the thing that we are doing now right aku feel macam deja vu tau aku feel like
aku pernah mimpi pasal this whole scenario serious I mean I mean now like what we are doing now
aku feel like deja vu sia ni
I will make it through lah as always dah nak dekat final year kan
but you know like I feel like I've been err apa ni stress eating tau
I mean when you are stressed you I I keep I keep like macam apa um
brody um brody pula err body project
then macam
macam he the guy is very
macam very inspirational ah very motivational nanti dia macam dia kelakar like every time like dia dah habis dia punya whole exercise kan nanti last last kan bila apa ni cool down kan nanti dia kasih macam those motivational speech nanti isteri dia will be like apa jer apa jer budak ni buat cause like dia punya speech is good lah because dia akan cakap things like
err okay the fact that you have err chosen this err this this workout the fact that you have chosen this video means that err you know that macam you know he's trying to say that err macam well done lah because like kau err kau decides to do this workout
in a way macam well done so like he's trying to make us feel very motivated because after like cause dia orang ada macam the the workout varies tau dia macam ada forty minutes I think the the least is like ten minutes
after forty minutes kau feel like you want to die right
so actually his speech is really very inspiring macam kau feel like okay ya that's why aku take this this this whole
it was like six years ago but only recently macam dia orang famous I think
kau try ah one day ya
because recently okay aku tried macam the videos from six years ago and the videos lah recently
yang six years six years ago is like purely macam because I think dia orang just started out right so macam dia orang very err
very macam mana nak cakap eh macam very rigid very cardio cardio you know macam dia orang punya videos macam really okay thirty second nanti ada countdown gitu sekarang dah macam more chillax macam dia orang ada letak lagu
it's good lah macam kau joget and then lagu dia macam
so kau don't feel like you are actually exercising
ya especially now that you are working from home kau nak kena really seh have to make time
because aku just recently started doing the cardio kan then there's this whole whole week yang aku tak err felt well so I didn't do workout aku dia punya apa
dia punya exhaustion tu dia punya level of exhaustion boleh rasa seh because it's like
you know kau feel so tired then kau feel like macam lemah
you know so that's why aku rasa like you you have to like um
actually aku have this intention tau like every morning bangun
pergi jogging
ya but actually you macam we must tau because I mean you're not getting any younger and then like um
our health ni is really very important because recently I just bought a kau tahu yang the blood pressure punya monitor cause my mum few days ago dia sakit kan yang dia pergi doctor tu so she had like macam high blood pressure lah
it was really very high so macam mm the doctor suruh pergi suruh beli that machine to monitor so I bought bought from watsons
beli ah then the past few days we've been checking our
then err my adik punya was like
hundred and fifty like below hundred and thirty gitu macam normal lah then my adik cakap eh tak kak tak tak err it is normal for me hundred and fifty lepas tu aku macam are you sure your are you sure it's normal abeh dia cakap kak I'm fat then aku
ya so aku macam oh is it cause
for me kan aku aku don't really bother about this kind of thing tau to be honest
ya so aku macam recently aku macam fikir eh actually really seh I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food
and then kau tengok lah muka aku ni macam this pimple it's really a sign that says that I'm not I I feel like I haven't been glowing
you know and I feel so macam
very sucky like you know like macam kau
because you can you can really see from your your face tau kalau kau really glow you know that kind of thing so that's why aku these few days aku feel like err really seh I could really feel like I need to wake up in the morning and go for a jog
ya true that's why lah aku cakap aku aku aku feel like I haven't been taking care of myself lately ever since err start online learning ni
cause aku feel like
to be honest macam dulu aku malam-malam aku letak letak apa those facial punya benda ah serious aku moisturizer aku really very very very consistent sekarang aku dah macam
ah lantak kau ah aku really malas tau then aku sekarang
aku could feel so
menyesal ah aku really menyesal
hey you sure kau step jer you are saying this because you are my friend
eh no but I actually kan aku feel you should like makeover ah your room
no kau kena macam letak dari sana
but what colour was your light macam is it like the macam
but you also bought yang the the stars thingy right the constellation punya lampu
but tak macam
macam mana nak cakap eh macam kau tidur tak tak affected your sleep ke
bila kau nyanyi kan
tahu selalu nampak kau punya story
bila kau tengah aurora tu maknanya kau tengah nyanyi ah
kan kita kindergarten tak sama kan eh no sama
your kindergarten yang dekat sana tu kan
bukan oh your kindergarten kat gek poh
your kindergarten is under the punya kan
sama lah
but mine was like err near the pioneer area sana
or maybe tak lah maybe we met in err primary school
bila eh kita start
it's always like that macam kau bila kau in the same environment with the person kan kau tak kau tak macam close tau nanti kalau kau dah habis sekolah ke apa habis macam habis kerja ke apa kan nanti kau just randomly
pergi trip dengan dia lah pergi holiday dengan dia lah
ya I have that friend also like my this one ex colleague dulu macam like when I was working with her
kita tak berbual langsung tau because
aku like macam kirakan assistant dia executive lah different roles kan because that time I was still taking my diploma she was already like degree holder gitu so different roles so I was like in one office and she was in another room
kita tak kita tak rapat then after I left then like tiba randomly kita because like for me like after after I left right usually I will like add them on facebook or instagram
then dia
dia macam random tiba-tiba dia ajak aku like pergi the one the one that I went perth with
and then the funny thing is like aku pergi trip dengan not only her but also with her sister and then like so funny like kita tiga like considered like strangers but then like when we were at perth kita just clicked instantly tau
and then aku macam amazed because
it's just so macam orang cakap macam senang ah masuk
aku just be real dengan kau ah
kau tahu kan recently dia sakit
oh okay so it's really very way back ah okay okay so macam macam gini
dia sakit kan
it was err before he balik
okay so he sakit tekak and stuff like that initially we thought it was like because of him smoking
so I was like macam
err because he's okay not only his throat tau then he always has like macam ulcer
so we tried like natural remedies lah macam kasih dia minum like those um honey lemon kasih dia pakai yang kau tahu bonjela gel stuff like that
so he went back he went back home then err macam biasa kena quarantine and stuff like that then macam aku cakap dengan dia err you go jumpa doctor kat sana jumpa clinic kat sana cause first of all it's cheaper and and and kau at least like macam
err at least get to the bottom of it lah because if not you don't know what's happening kan because we've been trying natural remedies and then it's not working lepas tu dia pergi clinic kat sini pun
it's not working as well and then one thing aku geram pasal dia kan is that dia nak benda kan nak nak dia sakit dia nak cepat like instantaneously tau
abeh aku macam eh come on lah like kau nak baik needs time to recover kan but dia tak dia macam nak kau tahu macam makan ubat hari ni esok nak baik
where got such thing right so okay tu tak apa then he like err
but he balik
okay he balik then um he
he balik
and apa eh
he balik he went for doctor and stuff like that
the doctor cakap
err he has to go for like further check up dekat err specialists but it will take time
so right now he's actually on err renal diet ah renal diet ni macam um less salt less sodium less potassium kalau kau ingat aku aku kadang-kadang aku post dekat instagram yang gambar-gambar masak it was actually for him
I don't know eh macam sometimes recently aku feel like um
macam mana nak cakap eh okay you know I'm a very
err okay even though aku introvert kan you know I'm a very outgoing person adventurous person and stuff like that
and then when aku with him aku feel like aku
but emotionally because aku feel like
few months kan it's it's always been about him okay maybe I'm selfish but it's always been about him and then like aku trying
macam okay kau tahu aku sakit tangan
aku don't feel the support from him also
aku tak tahu ah macam recently aku feel like
apa eh nak cakap eh
dia cakap dengan aku ah he said um okay you know of my condition and stuff like that kan like do you still want to be with me
but at that point of time aku was in err in a dilemma because
you know how um because okay I don't want to be that kind of girl yang macam
bila kau susah kau takde tapi bila kau senang kau ada you get what I mean
mesti ada ups and downs kan I want to be that kind of person who who has always been supportive
okay and when he asked me macam do you still want to be with me despite my condition aku felt
guilty aku felt bersalah because macam oh because of his condition now abeh aku nak tinggalkan dia
okay aku aku aku aku rasa kadang-kadang aku rasa macam aku pun depressed ah maybe because of the previous relationship I think my ex really really broke me
yang tadi aku jumpa tu I was telling her I said that you know sometimes
if if I macam if I could turn back time sometimes I wish macam there are some exes yang aku shouldn't have let go
macam I should you know my yang the ex from err poly tu yang dia nyanyi tu
you know like macam I I want those kind of relationship yang macam
kind of destroyed everything and then like you know recently aku added him on err instagram and then like a few days ago ah no actually was yesterday I saw his instagram story and I was tempted to message dia tau
but aku macam jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan message jangan cari pasal
like aku nak text but aku macam telling myself not to
but to be honest there are some there are times where aku felt like
he wanted different things and then there was a third party which aku ni gatal sangat pergi melayan the third party was my recent ex
so that's why aku like when I think about this whole thing kan aku feel like macam
I shouldn't have layan the ex man I mean I shouldn't have layan that third party
because you know you know that that time err during one of my um poly friend punya wedding kan we met
aku lupa tau aku honestly forgot that he was the cause of the break up
then aku introduce macam tak bersalah gitu lepas tu because I only I didn't notice at that point of time I only remembered when I was looking back at my memory box because I have this memory box where I apa tu
cause dulu aku dengan dia okay lah a bit cheesy lah we we write letters to each other
ya he's that kind of guy and aku I'm a sucker for letters like to me it's very sentimental and we have those you know macam coupons that was my birthday like gift lah to him macam coupons macam
okay um redeem this to get a free dinner ah macam redeem this to get a free massage ah macam gitu you know
there's this book that I wrote tau aku dengan dia tulis err tak kita macam okay kau tahu macam paper kan lepas tu kita macam gunting then kita macam staple lah tepi tu macam make it into a book so we wrote down like
things that I dislike about you serious things I like about you err what do you want to change in this relationship then macam appraisal
ya so so we did that so we did that then um apa ni err
I oh he wrote down that person name so like recently kan aku look through kan then aku realise oh my god he hated this person so I was like
and then I introduce them then aku was like oh my god what ya then I was like what did I do you know no no wonder okay lah because you know you know you know when a person is looking at you kan
I mean my ex yang best friend tu
err he was looking at me and then from dia macam dia tengok kan abeh kalau kau tengok dia tiba-tiba mata dia macam
I don't know because okay lah recently okay aku be honest with dengan kau eh
ya online through err because kita friends again what on instagram
I tried to like macam talk to him and stuff like that but
err a conversation into me lah macam with me so macam dia
macam kita berbual then after that nanti kadang-kadang dia just seen tak reply gitu so macam so aku macam okay lah but
because I was thinking about it lah cause you know two of my exes aku came back to them right two of my exes and then it didn't work out what kan
then I was thinking kalau if I were to get back with this ex kan
like I remember merepek gila ya allah I don't know it was like macam I think it was after his performance or something
okay I can't remember but I remember this one part where kita naik tau he was sitting at the two seater seat and I was sitting at the long seat tu
abeh dah sampai buona vista eh was it buona vista
so I just left keluar gitu I just left like that
and I just leave him dekat seorang seorang and
I recently yang we got back I mean not we got back like I added I mean added him on err instagram kan ya ya he followed me back so
err aku dia
aku told him lah okay actually it was very funny because aku
can I be honest I say ya sure sure lepas tu dia cakap
err you are a very sensitive person gini gini semua abeh dia cakap um it's better kau boleh tone down sikit kau punya err sensitivity but I was reading it and I was triggered
you know macam you don't tell me not to be sensitive but okay lah aku appreciate his err feedback
tak actually seriously dia dia baik tau because kan um but dia pun sayang aku
baik lah cuma aku jer shitty
that's why aku
that's why I said tadi ah I was telling myself I said you know if I could turn back time
actually kan aku rasa kalau aku tak break up dengan dia kan aku rasa kita dah ada anak seh dah kahwin because kita okay lah ya in that book right we actually wrote err when to get married and stuff like that we actually plan to get married when kita twenty seven tau twenty seven years old so kau imagine
or at least two kids seh ya so sekarang macam aku dengan dia both
plans pun tak work out
I mean I've been wanting to do that actually but I just telling I was just telling myself like jangan main gila jangan main gila
but I think aku dream about him because I've been looking at his instagram story
err that time I found out he just putus tunang actually he's a very private person tau because that time he tunang then he didn't post his tunang face
so it was like dia tunjuk okay ah okay err yang gambar ni aku tak tak nampak because back then aku tak follow him yet but it was my friend lah who showed me that picture so it was like just a picture of a bouquet of flowers and a ring so ya lah to show that you know dia dah tunang
but recently yang kita met back tu at a wedding
aku aku random ah aku tanya dia eh mana tunang kau
oh dia macam oh err takde ah
then that's when I know he dah putus tunang
but I don't know whether he's seeing anyone or not because takkan aku nak cakap dengan dia eh kau seeing anyone ke tak you know like
actually macam aku fikir balik kan it's amazing how I remember all my exes punya birthday
kan aku I don't know what's wrong but I remember his birthday so I was thinking like mm maybe ada ada ada ada tu eh
mm ada lah end of january
ya so we'll see lah we'll see maybe maybe I will just like ask him ke like hey wanna grab a coffee
okay nanti nearer to his birthday kau remind aku this ah
because aku takut I will ask him the question instead
ya hopefully hopefully because like macam next year kan dia dah turn thirty kan
ya so like bila dia turn thirty tu orang cakap wiser a bit lah it's like throw away your twenties and then start thirty with something new
eh nanti kan dah habis just tekan yang tick tu tau
lepas ni I can't wait to eat our sushi
how can you forget dia kat depan jer seh
okay lah jap lagi lagi berapa minit jer actually it's like what almost it's only it's like one minute left seh

tapi kita selalu dengar macam uh macam kita dengar benda lah
okay bilik kita bilik hujung
okay the okay bilik the hotel is famous the hotel is very big
we find it strange cause we said but we didn't even mention cause you know how orang orang tua cakap mulut jangan celupar bila kita dekat tempat tu
leceh seh
kita okay kita dah bawa keluar semua tilam
we still when when we we kita share when kita kongsi story uh cerita ni dengan um
the shopping mall is just down bawah
ya you told me about your kakak
ya but your kakak cause your your kakak dah tidur
okay baik okay let's start the things macam how's things on your weekend
ya I mean tadi ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid dia tidur all the way so my wife ingatkan dia can go to the hairdresser and then just relax kejap lah
you know just have a relaxing hair trim err hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that err because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before balik kerja eh jadi dia nak
dia nak one whole day just pamper sendiri saja lah so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this ah just nice also you err you also jadi to do all these things ya so K lor so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
err while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament punya benda
exactly ya ya that's my idea pun I was also thinking about that actually
ya so ya I also err not been discussing my guys err all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with lah err those that were in the semua tu
so dia orang kata you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when kita takde benda you know like you you there's no real cove lah
like everybody knows kita punya reputation tapi takde takde portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event dulu
the weekly event and then just nice err earlier this week ada there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so dia punya format eh sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee jadi first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so kalau kalau all sixty four players masuk dalam
prizenya tak banyak it is seriously tak banyak actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person jadi the whole prize pool eh baru apa enam ratus six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus dollar pun tak sampai it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league jadi kena main each other for like
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches jadi a a lot of the the response of the company semua tak nak main it's like eh it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars tapi you know like it's nak you you enter that
only top three dapat menang apa-apa and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even dua ratus so banyak orang you know the dia orang tak suka lah all this thing ah so I was wondering but
maybe let's say like of the registration fees kan ninety percent these guys only did like not even half ah what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent tak sampai setengah of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day saja and then err we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves err ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so err what's that called
um so serious because we are our own clients apa
so you know there's kita we can just like borak have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them ah look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars ah because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time saja lah so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
I I I entah eh I also don't know how many people have resgistered tapi the the response I get banyak orang semua semua kutuk ah critics semua kutuk top top white center
now semua kata you know ni apa apa benda what kind of nonsense is this you know buat apa kita main buat apa I mean we play so much habis duit sikit saja then kena main lama lama how many weeks ya lah ada better things to do ah than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no tak tak tak nampak lain ah ada apa eh let me see kalau ada league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
namanya D to sports league entah siapa I langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada nine hundred plus members kat dalam
let's see ada tak berapa berapa orang dah sign up tak ni tak nampak pula eh
tapi nampak macam masih buka jer masih boleh sign up jer
a'ah berapa orang
ah belum tahu ah berapa orang ah kat dalam
tapi ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this err whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so semua orang kata like
so there wasn't even any one they say alah just go for the fun of biar jer langsung takde orang say that semua semua kutuk okay I'll I when I say semua eh it's literally there only like three people that response ah that responded
yang lain semua you know buat buat tak kisah saja
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab ah dia orang just buat ni benda just err make a few posters bilang semua okay eh aku ada league ah you know you get thirty percent kalau kamu menang you get thirty percent
tapi fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything benda senang I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
macam gray macam makan makan makan sendiri ah makan all the community
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event semua kan minimum or I think we can do a uh forty a thirty forty players so takde issue langsung ah
itu pun susah juga kan so I'm so I'm thinking at least kalau kita have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just err macam mana kata eh
every week ada content baru that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
actually nak kata possible eh
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once ah actually nak kata registration fee selalunya berapa
because they're by community centre budget no problem untuk dia punya wang actually it's free registration dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa
so it's just my masuk lah kan but that's for the punya lah um ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play juga then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that lah
tapi for all the events um what ah who ah they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just dia orang just bayar bayar bayar jer so takde registration fee takpe juga untuk dia orang ya but for us we add in lah as much as we want to we are we are okay with
uh how do I say ah ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think alamak one day registration fee sepuluh ketul and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way err let's say registration fee let's say lima ketul lah I I can definitely okay
the more people that join your prize pun naik gila babi
uh one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match kau dah menang tiga dollar
ah duit datang balik tau all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
dah eighty percent eh a'ah sia tu dah banyak juga tu
soon lepas tu kalau dapat masuk to the semi final top four ah
err so five percent each lima peratus satu orang lima peratus okay naik top four
ah kau dapat sepuluh percent lah sepuluh peratus ah
correct so you masuk kalau you masuk quarter final sudah dapat five percent you masuk semi final you get ten percent
you masuk final up to fifteen percent
err mana percent yang
kejap eh so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four eh the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright naik four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool dah removed
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within err apa tu
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent pun boleh thirty percent of the total prize pool
matchmaking pun susah ah ah ya so so that's the thing ah then the list uh ya uneven
ya eh kalau tak some people get a buy then they get their money back eh that's not fair juga eh
thirty two fairly I think eh no problem senang
senang ah senang
ah tu ah
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing kan I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off um so that hopefully we can get our own uh third party sponsors ah takde orang akan kacau kita lah
falls the one that is working with SCOGA ah cause dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat community events sendiri juga
my understanding is that he has his own production punya house or something like that
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that kan we telling him that eh looked operations side kita semua dah settled everything kita dah dah fikir masak-masak and kita boleh you know bawa orang-orang confirm register punya
you know tapi the one problem kan that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA duit no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more err jet ideas
that is what N nadesan has been saying ah kalau duit anything with money ke apa kan with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford kita
tapi so that's that's the thing ah we will be working you know like uh together with SCOGA it won't be our event eh technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
semua ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway lah actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like ah people association entah apa community club lah sports club
south west ni semua so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this err apa dia E delta league
I don't know macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu lah eh tapi organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up oh okay so it's gonna be an offline event ah kirakan ah kalau venue partner dah sports up tapi it's um ah you know like um it's again ah
so basically SCOGA eh in my opinion how they've been running all their events kan sama macam zenway sama
dia orang just buat the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
our venture punya logo whatever it is lah eh we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that uh ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife ah technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event dia tak suka the idea of kita um how to say ah handing over the rains to another person
dia nak kita hundred percent seratus peratus ni event kita bukan orang lain punya this is ours have our name over there for and then of this uh
you know orang lain tak boleh kacau ah senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner kita sure but it's not kita joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
then they'll be like mana nama kau aku nampak nama SCOGA jer nama kau mana
I said oh now we work under SCOGA mana bukti
kita tak tahu SCOGA kita tak boleh you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if kalau kita boleh tunjuk on a poster that has our logo on it
dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa ah they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what ah err we are not not just mere partners or whatever kita tak buat apa-apa but
kita yang run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with ah whoever but they have to be partners it's not kita join dia orang we work under their name
satu orang kena start dulu ah senang kata
tu tu yang juga eh that
and then why I also tak nak like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside semua
tapi there there would seem a little bit of a chip ah then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor kata okay so siapa yang sponsor your previous event uh and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I tengok eh ini kau punya company apa
ah ha ha ha tu yang problem juga
but I think I would okay nak kata our community eh okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like um
I macam mana nak kata uh ada orang kata a lot of times at people sponsor benda kan they don't actually get anything much out of it
junior apa junior what
I think ya I think in the end tu nak buat sponsor tag ah in the end
you know macam mana eh I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now dekat facebook eh all the videos kan it will show how many views ada ada ada rather it will show how many views actually
ah what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views lah apa lah itu semua tak ada um ya even okay right now zenway is live right now sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok some mobile legends punya benda
ya but I don't see any total views belum lagi belum lagi total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show berapa eh let me see another video
ah tapi the problem my my midnight punya shows ah
one play sports videos the problem with semua malam-malam betul ah paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang problemnya
ada ada orang but it's not that much ah okay ya I'm looking here
mm asia champions league semalam nine hundred views err asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
one hour juga ni semua one our cast
but that was the the very first punya lah I mean like it was the first
err but they split it into different parts ah macam part one first two hours ten ten K views
quite quite a bit this four lah but then again eh E sports ada berapa berapa followers ni E sports how many followers
aiman will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask iman pun can we stream it on your stream
or even better if we can get we can rope aiman in as a commentator juga lah
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that lah like how sia macam mana aku nak you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
jadi kalau kalau if there's a way eh for us to go meet aiman I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think kalau kita bilang dia look kita ini kita semua eh kita will ini kita punya event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money ah so maybe kalau dia dengar tu eh the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now dia ada banyak banyak event kan
jadi kalau kalau a'ah sia dia banyak events ah so I don't know what he was bitching to us about lah jadi honestly I was like dude ini it like it ah I look I know you're disappointed E piala malaysia of fucking meeting ah err bullshit I just said ah sorry
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity ah you're winning quantity wise those two guys eh other than E piala malaysia apa lain dengan other dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda
ah lepas
tak tak takde benda sia I can't I ah
okay I know that err see siapa ni matthew eh has uh has uh some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing dari bola tau so you know ah oh kalau nak kata streaming bola jer
dia orang takde benda sia decipher lagi takde benda at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa tau
so ya so he said oh I lost out to them honestly ah it's just connections ah you lost tau on connections ah that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E piala malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
because I know he's been doing singapore events juga
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our chapalang event tak ada sponsor takde apa takde benda
us sepuluh ribu views tau
you know err ya I also can tell it you know ah definitely when I when I let know of my community err this this affinity whatsapp group semua that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block kita ada ah aku aku pun tak tak takde ideas ah apa nak buat like to find my own third party sponsor semua takde idea langsung ah
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or err what ah macam macam kau dan aku yang yang my friend hafiz the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that kan
I broached either to him by eh nak sponsor kita tak you know this sort of event then kalau kau betul-betul managed to get them in eh aku bagi kau you know some some credit or whatever lah some kickback lah so dia kata
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage dia orang tak langsung tak support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
officially eh looking at their website eh dia kata ah they are a youth non profit organisation
kalau nak under official words ah
um ya they have err few initiatives lah all this err E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya err and they let see apa lagi dia orang ada eh about us

err my name azmirul I'm from singapore poly sekarang sekolah
you wanna talk about kita punya singapore poly life lah so far
sekarang boleh manage ah tapi like last time when I first entered aku really tak minat the course
so it was kind of susah lah untuk aku
oh pasal dulu my first few choices was uh business business finance abeh aku minat tourism
so I put there only my first six choice ah then my marine engineering was aku nya tujuh ke lapan ah
I not sure but yes ah aku aku tak minat tapi
aku nya points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so aku just kena taruk the aku just kena taruk any course that I can put lah
tapi along the way alhamdulillah
aku minat ah aku minat
aku minat ah aku minat marine engineering nya module
so kau apa sekarang lah like what are you doing in school what are your activities
aku in dikir barat ah as you know
I I always tried to pull you in dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk so
now I really want to know the reason why kau tak nak masuk dikir barat
okay lah boleh boleh
muay thai pun
bukannya muay thai nanti
ada stage fright ke like macam ada spectators tengok
right faham faham I understand
because sekarang pun COVID
then like kita lima hari five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then kadang-kadang
sama juga I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in my apa tu uh younger days ah my sec one sec two menengah satu menengah dua that kind so I
every month bapa kena call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise yang
so that's when aku sedar lah that I have to bulk up kalau tak memang aku takleh survive N or O levels
I did get twelve points ah takleh
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject yang aku ambil
then aku end up in poly now
ya what is the most macam
what is the most naughty thing yang kau pernah buat secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most yang paling
so kira kan self self nominate kau terus masuk
actually talking about yang student student council student leader and
dulu like what you said I was very naughty nakal gila
macam apa aku buat semua aku kena tone down pasal aku chairperson of the class and my school dorang ada selalu macam best chairperson
best leader best apa so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last lah basically macam in the rankings so macam sec three tu memang quite tough lah is like I'm still naughty
but end up nanti cikgu jalan
dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong ah I go angkat
teacher you need help ah then aku angkat aku angkat kan masuk staffroom
so kira like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so aku just suck it up lah
and my teachers in sports leaders suka aku
pasal aku not the quiet type
but students leader punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku naughty sangat so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school lah tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada different opinion about the same person
that's that's being naughty lah dekat sekolah
oh kira tu naughty ah kan
kira tu naughty ah kan
tu bikin kau paling guilty ah kan
guilty tak eh
jadi cikgu tertipu kan
so macam dorang dah bless ah
so lepas O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time ke
aku kerja yang kau tahu volunteer volunteer punya
yang nampak dekat uh fast jobs nanti dia cakap oh you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance ah kira that time too is big money for me know so kadang-kadang kalau ada shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
that was my basically aku nya work for my whole N level till when I go sec five ah
so aku akan kerja all the way
then basically nothing much ah aku just kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
experience aku pernah tau sekali kerja
tiga hari jer off day aku nya gaji at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus
selepas minus
so if anybody interested join staff masuk lah ya so
irony but I do have some problems lah I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama age
the same pemikiran lah basically so aku just
aku just tahan for two months then aku just took adapt aku just try to adapt to the situation lah yang aku aku was in
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly baik gila
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities semua dorang kena beli then they have to keep at home
wah salute ah dorang
I don't dah
oh is not always the sama part lah
like macam
as in aku prefer tau honestly aku would prefer a busy
a busy working environment pasal at least aku ada benda tau nak buat like something to do kalau they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
macam benda ni semua I can see cikgu kita are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be macam very independent because in the future semua benda-benda engineering ni semua
they won't hari-hari tengok kau buat
that's why macam I feel engineering early brush you lah and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop ah
macam betul-betul flop then susah once you know once dah jatuh in poly susah nak naik balik
aku masuk shore which is first first semester so right after this semester aku probably has a month's break then after that aku dah kena masuk intern lah
by dia punya sailing
aku nak belayar basically I just want to go
explore countries negara semua negara england semua whatever lah
uh yang ada ports semua kan saudi arabia ke whatever
so aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak
dapat sailing results must be very strong
so aku legit work very hard
untuk aku year one year two tapi
aku punya type is aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir ah
so at the end of the day aku don't mind shore kalau dapat keppel okay lor
kira very good orh keppel
ya betul
but ya lah you so you are willing lah kau kira willing untuk sail every year six months
time kau balik pun dah penat
so your ultimate goal is to get macam
pasal you are not away from your family too long
surveyor macam benda relax ah
okay ah during during circuit breaker and all we all semua stuck dekat rumah
pelik but yes aku
aku found a love from
karma medic lah nama youtube channel
and aku suka biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class duduk belakang dengar
but ya the love come back and I feel like kalau I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni ke apa
ya so talking about uni kita belum lagi lepas
wayang ah
so ah the frogmen one tu yang paling gerek ah
so aku nak masuk navy tapi aku tahu
aku tahu tak probably tak ada chance lah masuk navy kan
ada chance will be slim
but yes ah so kalau
tak aku nak try my best to go police
kalau police pun
aku kena train banyak so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
kalau tak pun I don't mind
eh pula I don't mind civil defense
tu pun pergi tau sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai
my father never go so aku rasa I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always kena hijau from the trend lah that's what they say lah but no hijau for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring lah my opinion macam gitu-gitu jer ya okay lah tengok macam mana
tapi kalau aku dapat air force who wouldn't take it
chey wah pandai seh tak ah intelligence
what was your score though they never tell you tak bilang
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult ke apa
kalau let's say ke dah dah minat nak sign on
kena berapa bagus wow
ada size dia ah
sekarang berapa years
masih eh masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun jer primary school
bila primary school kan nanti
nanti kita tengok movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there kita semua dah
dah basically know the type of person you want to be like err like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first macam entertainment punya movie show kan was ah
macam I didn't realise tau yang itu semua watak
as in tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua just rekaan tau I didn't know
then I thought macam okay let's say macam dulu undertaker betul-betul lah dia jahat betul-betul lah dia nak nak nak menang jer nak kasi orang sakit
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like macam undertaker
buat mata dia yang roll eyes back
so kira macam last time primary school was one of the best times because
kita explore ah
kita explore banyak benda
satu hari kita undertaker the next day we john cena the next day yuka civi
ya in primary school also dulu kita suka buat banyak parkour
striker yang
bebas like horse kick right
have you ever win the finals pernah menang
who's your bogey team ah macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti
macam you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
for me kalau bab-bab
macam atau activity kan
I was goalkeeper you know you know when kau penjaga gawang in primary school
if the goals you concede so we basically second round kita dah keluar everytime
kita masuk south zone kita keluar kita group stages
then secondary school I was in so kau tahu ada banyak
lah yang joget-joget sambil marching
ah make the police create the league untuk macam orang-orang tak
untuk all the budak melayu not only budak melayu lah budak melayu budak cina there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors semua masuk
tu pun second round kita out
I join dikir barat
I join dikir barat and my first ever performance
so of course after the performance aku nangis siol
aku really my heart was pouring ah
so that that was when my mood for dikir honestly
aku kena aku kena step in to change
for dikir barat
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents ragu-ragu ah
my parents will think eh macam mana aku nya anak nya results
sekolah pelajaran akan jeopardise ke tak
that kind of thing so aku pun macam second guess ah aku second guess but I love dikir barat so much
in dikir barat twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like macam nama engraved dekat dekat kau nya trophy I also never had the recognition of
pemenang dikir barat singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
it's a heavy responsibility tapi we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
macam teaching
your kawan takkan eh coach pasal they coach kau marah dia tapi kau as a kawan kau still tolong that kind of thing
we have our ups and downs juga ah
kau cannot
kalau kau always feel that you are at the bottom
dah kita dah improve at least be happy about it jangan cakap yay tak last
that that that pada aku tu yang paling penting ah dalam
dalam inner change
you can't keep thinking of eh kita dulu last
as in berbual macam single ke attached ke seeing someone
mana lah aku tahu aku dah lama tak jumpa
kau boleh click ah basically
cinta monyet eh dulu
happy ah dapat berbual dengan kau talk to you for an hour get to know you a bit more
and terima kasih ah

tu ah like personal experience right then wah every year confirm hor you open your cabinet raya finish already still confirm got a few more then obviously we go people house we ask them top up we helping them finish what make their money worth
I think ah I don't actually remember seh I think hor wah I think I just go makan man I go makan but sad lor makan only five people per table mah so everyone have to sit far far apart like now also you want go makan see everybody also sit so far apart
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
to be honest ah aku ni boleh consider ah ada obsession sikit singaporean ah typical bubble tea wah when they announce ah that bubble tea closing wah jialat I already like stress eh cause like how I don't know how long they reopening what then I tried to find like other ways that I can like sub to my bubble tea wah nothing beats to it eh legit I then I just wah keep thinking of it pastu bila dia dah buka nak beli tengok queue dia tak apa ah kirim salam you leh do you drink bubble tea
eh tu sedap seh ya actually kan aku nak sub tu untuk aku punya bubble tea tau bila circuit breaker then wah jialat that one also close everything close then I don't know what to drink anymore then I think ah the circuit breaker ah was like diet to me

eh abeh kalau compare kan semua bubble tea kan kau rasa mana satu yang paling mahal
tak eh sedap tak
oh abeh entah eh aku macam nak beli pun macam berat hati seh mahal seh uh abeh kat sekolah kau aku selalu dengar dari sekolah kau orang selalu beli bubble tea sedap ke bubble tea dia
I don't know eh to be honest ah I don't really like my school food cause first day my I I I know your school got like student price right my school standard price leh for public also then it's quite pricey then also ah not a lot of halal food then want find halal food cannot really find anywhere then maybe hmm like can only eat like McDonald's like that one easy ah halal but if you go food court that all ah quite difficult then hari hari makan nasi ayam ah then don't know eh got try my school food before
wah jialat I tell you ah wah if can ah I want buy roller blade sia it's damn far it's like my school is one end to the other end cause last time ah dengar dengar ah dorang kata my sekolah building burn down so dorang nak reclaim dorang letak at a new place ah so dorang letak new place tu dorang letak kat belakang then wah punya lah jauh like katakan eh you thought ah you thought you reach school early but wah you still reach class late but luckily my class got fifteen minutes grace so like okay lah can still use that fifteen minutes to jalan jalan your school leh your school so spaced out seh it's not besar but I think it's quite spaced out not far meh from one class to the other
but your school ah a bit weird leh cause like if see from in front ah quite small padan ah got behind behind some more quite complicated leh don't know how you can like learn how to find your way around
eh but right I know your school ah a lot of people just go there wah say only ah study always tell parents study but actually they don't really study one ah confirm like only merayap here merayap there then walk here walk there only you irritated or not
eh but sekerang tengah COVID ni tak ada orang kick you out ke you still can study at school meh
hmm but okay lah at least not like a lot of student now so so a bit better you all still got a bit more space then some more ah COVID now also you all kena separated must sit far far apart right
eh how your nenek ah like she cannot go out she at home only ah
wah not bad ah your nenek can know how to use this atas atas app
okay okay no wonder I was about to like wah so atas this one nenek modern is it then like your other family member leh they go out they work from home or go out also
hmm so like that nobody at home your nenek find more chance to keluar lah
then do you prefer her lama one or sekarang one
hmm then favourite makanan like masakan dia what for you
hmm then kau often tak tolong dia kat dalam dapur
but tak salah your area semua dekat dekat jer kan
oh abeh usually you all walk or like what
hmm but okay lah at least you with your nenek is it then you got friend then you can talk talk like that
hmm then wah did you miss your nenek cooking when you go school or what
dan hari ni kita akan berbual tentang anything under the sun
school sekolah
super senang apa lagi
like is it fun ada kawan-kawan ke tak
abeh kau punya time table like how is your
is it banyak time untuk relax atau tak
abeh pukul berapa what like what time is your lesson
oh ya I saw like I always see your Instagram like kau macam penat gila because you always like
abeh aku wave at you and you literally didn't you ignored me bro I was so sad
no aku literally waved at you
embarrassed kan ya aku pun I felt so malu because of that
that time aku remember that I told you the story
like that time I was down your block I saw this girl pakai tudung exactly same as you
err I aku aku not mad at you aku mad at the situation because aku was so embarrassed aku malu gila I was down the block
I saw uh cause it was at night malam-malam so aku saw this lady
she was wearing her tudung and she was in the dark
wave paling besar di dalam dunia like literally like this
macam tak kena gitu situation gitu
ya so for me sekolah aku I think it's super senang to go to school because I don't have to take a bus
aku tengah flex right now ya
ya cause now my school kalau kau nak masuk kau nak kena ada dia punya card like the specific card
measures no uh no as in in terms of the zones like for your school kau ada zone like different different zones
yang colour biru merah orange
the only my school has mala at uh food court empat
ya tu pun
oh kita punya junior eh
oh dia makan mala
ya ya tapi kita boleh masuk ke tak
but the thing is mala at causeway point macam mahal gila
I don't know if it's mahal gila eh
no tapi um I told amira then I um err apa jaz
jaz she ate it it was like seven dollar per person cause dia tak makan the daging semua the daging is a mistake
who eats the daging you just go for the
that doesn't count as daging that counts as one of those processed meat macam spam daging is like literally daging yang macam masak tu
of course it's gonna be mahal it's like duck meat err
remember duck meat punya ramen that we ate at the apa
I was asking my bapa cause he was like asking like suggestions to eat and I was like oh can I suggest then I was like oh can we eat at the ramen and then he was like err I'll think about it then we never eat
was it one of those like lemak
oh ya sebab kau punya stomach kan ada problem sekarang
kesian baby
uh sebab you're like a baby you can't like handle the full Samyang experience that sounds like a
macam like the gravy ah
I don't I don't get why you don't like the carbonara one carbonara one is literally like the best punya flavour
man aku baru makan Samyang on is it yesterday or two days ago
is it because you never leave it inside for a longer time because I like my Samyang to be like puffy what's the word macam like
oh I don't know why but semalam aku macam on a
university punya rush so I was like looking at all the
ya because I aku fikir uh I really don't have a choice but to like look through siapa lia punya boyfriend sekarang dekat kan
what was his his course ah or should I ask like lia to ask him about dia punya experience
ada banyak mm
dorang take in like
ya kau tak kau tak research ke
then lepas poly kau nak buat apa
you actually like oh so kau macam like committed ah in that sense okay
uh aku scared yang dorang tengah trying to convince you to spend more money by the way they say it
she ya you should just since kau ada connection might as well just take advantage of it ah
dekat singapore
kerja kat perth ah
jangan world ni dah dah start ni dah start dah start
tadi tadi macam like on a you're still on the ground tapi ni a bit like floating
you I thought your mum ada your mum kasi
or I thought she was the one yang ada attachment punya issues dengan kau
macam like my kawan elisa
dia pun like thinking of
yang half malay half chinese yang whose in my classmate
oh tu tahu okay um elisa dia selalu kata but to her ma yang oh
ma one day I might want to go to like overseas or like migrate and then she's then cause she's like the youngest one and then all her kakak is like big
so dia mak dia selalu like oh then I'll come with you lah macam gitu
cause mak dia is quite to tua lah ya
and she said it okay okay she did lah it wasn't kinda like show off show offy punya manner
so aku then I was like aku macam shocked because I didn't know this also like it makes sense lah because she's also like super smart
my course is so filled with so many smart people aku macam so intimidated
it's uh sometimes no no we're not competitive that's not like the that's just not our culture lah our punya course punya culture like no one is like
we're like so sikit
punya orang if we like make enemies then the ecosystem will like break you get what I mean
kau punya course banyak orang y'all make enemies you won't you can just like
tak tahu err but I think she's still going for the
apa macam plan like have like one whole like plan for like dorang punya rest of their lives
after poly dorang gi university then after that apa kerja sikit then
so like whenever I'm with her aku macam like intimidated sikit ah sebab aku selalu kan aku ada going with the flow punya attitude
but I know what I want to like but at least like luckily I got like what I want to do lah I think it's my intern lah you were right what you were saying apa
kau punya comment lah like huda I'm so proud of you
pergi overseas
tapi dia like pandai enough to go for local uni ah so I'm not too worried about her
uh I think her overseas dream is untuk like
like kerja sana
ya sebab dorang ada minimum wage semua
I mean kau ada
it's better to like have a loan with your parents than a loan with like a bank because banks are always like the interest semua the
ya I think the realisation that kita macam like growing up just like hits
oh sebab ada dina
ah foundation or whatever tak tahu
I want to learn more about like apa
aku nak belajar more about macam like social work gitu
when I went for my intern I really like felt macam like left uh not left out lah I just felt
not in the social work ah kan aku bilang kau social service organisations semua
tu like in the
kalau all fails I I can be like a teacher kau pun nak jadi teacher
cikgu kan
cikgu aliah
I mean like aku aku knew that I had like interest in like
kerja for like the community gitu like I like to give back to the society gitu because like
doing business just like sucks the life out of you like it's so like macam boring and like
I really like at the end of the day aku macam like
macam apa haziq
haziq dia pergi apa kau tahu yang internship yang international
but then sebab
the overseas punya internship it was supposed to be overseas
ah tak tahu pula
ya tapi sebab dia kan like
dia he okay okay so
I know kau kind of like sceptical pasal dia punya like wealth
tapi uh elisa like dia explain to aku like dia punya how
in this like manner maybe kau macam like believe
so dia millionaire sebab
he would like his family would like invest in like oil punya stocks
apa return investment I'm like aku macam like a terrible
hundred thousand which should like deduct to be like sekarang kau believe tak
ni ni on like um oil
dorang kaya dorang like old money
cause sebab uh apa
on last friday tu aku I had to do like a sharing
sharer there who's like an punya student tapi haziq was there also and I'm like ugh
ah nanti aku show kau I was like talking about pe
you know aku pulled out all the I pulled out all the cards macam
and then he also talking about his internship ah tapi really kesian dia lah dia macam kau
apa cause about COVID then he had to like
come back to singapore gitu
kau cancelled immediately sebab was like in a mess
tapi this one was like indonesia was still like okay lah singapore indonesia boleh pergi because it was like in the same like circumference
so they ah pergi lah but then
after that they were like err this is worst than we expected you have to come back then gitu
because your one is apa macam tourist punya management so you you had to like have people there
this one was like business so everything could have been done online lah so it semua makes sense ah I'm
be tapi aku didn't like expect there's like oh
kau nak cakap pasal addison rae
I think that's like her brand lah that's macam apa jojo siwa
oh ya allah
then kau jangan kau jangan tengok video dia lah it's like she's not forcing you to watch her video
like I saw dia buat yang makeup punya video yang dia buat like clown
tak tahu lah
tak tahu lah I just see jer
wait aku Google avani net worth sekarang
oh dia tu takde like takde dia punya it
whoa kau kau memang critical of her eh
she's ni budak kecil
ya allah you're too critical of this show eh
dah kau punya addison rae punya sharing dah habis
would I love to talk to her but if I know like aku someone sikit
like dia he can talk lah
so but james sekarang kan dia ada banyak like years of experience sebab dia kan he was like he was the cover girl
he was the first like male punya cover girl so he went for a lot of apa talk shows dengan ellen semua
you know so kau you need to like be like
baik like kinder to them sikit lah please
tapi dorang famous
kau nampak yang TikTok punya
coffee punya tu manis oi and I was like seeing like four pumps of like mocha you know you saw that one
I aku aku bilang kau kan yang coffee kadang kasi aku macam anxiety so aku macam aku sangat
it's like I think uh cause I think aku ada break from coffee sebab I was like
kat rumah the whole time so I didn't like really was like
then after that uh I think a couple of weeks ago when I texted you was the first macam like
time minum coffee then aku my anxiety was like I had like I was so anxious
and then suddenly aku macam like so like scared
that day aku minum coffee day lah because I thought it was just like a one off thing you know
macam you know experiment we have to do it like a couple of times to make sure you're right
sekarang aku really cannot minum coffee again
which is sedih cause I love the taste of coffee you know how much I love like the taste of coffee
was it because of anxiety or apa
kau bodoh eh that's like the worst
kau macam better lah so
tapi tak pernah pass out
the day you actually pass out then you're like oh huda aku pass out I'll be like
kau nak pass out kan pass out lah
I guess now sebab aku tak boleh minum coffee then it should be easier for both of us ah so whenever Starbucks ada one for one I will never ask you
best punya
because uh aku try the LiHO punya pun
um it just doesn't hit as much as Sharetea punya oo
the matcha doughnut yang aku beli that day
it was so sedap sebab aku popped it in the microwave for like ten seconds it
but I bought also the mochi punya dough the like circle circle tu
uh mochi okay aku Google eh sebab uh kau tahu newt dari TikTok
oo sedap oi
and I was like aku expected it to be sedap ah
yang Dunkin' Donuts tu
aku I was feeling it cause these days I really love like sweets yesterday aku beli apa crepe

halal punya baker
bukan Chateraise um one of those like malay punya J&C ke entah apa

kesian baby
she I think she sebab kan dia memang ada feelings for rafi so I understand where she's coming from lah
I know it's obvious yang kau tak suka dia from the day one kau tak suka dia
to apa
the first so like the first time can you nampak dina
I think sebab it just
kesian sia
okay kau cakap dengar dengar aku tengah dengar ni
breaded tak
impulse like impulse tu
salvage dia punya
dia reply aku
dia tengah salvage
aku relieved ah yang dia tak ada grudge to aku cause I really like
err I feel aku rasa macam like
um maybe sekarang sebab ada pandemic there's a bit too much businesses but
orang yang suka baking then they sell like those
I'm aku kan bilang kau aku aku dah orang manis so I need to consume err manis
but I like apa my favourite treats are like
I like dia punya frosting punya flavour that's all I like I don't like macam like simple like chocolate rice gitu
aku uh aku uh aku a complicated girl
so rishi was like talking about it semalam
I would feel sedih also
of course korang best korang best friend
ya dia date untuk
like she wants them to act way more mature for their age dia ada dia punya expectations
terlalu high
and she's she expect all these guys to have like a stable job when apa dorang kat poly ke serving
you know kita tengah sekolah
is it sebab dia desperate to like
can like also get out of the house or something sebab dia punya environment very like toxic sikit
kau tengah give off love
ya tapi he can't he can't help it pe
and safirah couldn't help but falling for him at least sekarang dia over him lah but now she has this guy
hais kesian dia
belum lah that's why I put it inside the laundry punya basket
uh I would put it inside the washing machine then I would tu ya wash
uh bila aku ada bibik uh when I was bila aku kecil
and that's because sebab dulu like basuh basuh basuh basuh so it's like
but sekarang we do it on our own lah
and then I had the bibik to take care of my moyang
actually sekarang so far
I mean being in army like a lot of things already sudah restricted so
naturally we all sudah tak boleh keluar tak boleh go see our friends and all that so weekdays all aku pun tak free then
you know follow so that you know sekarang tak tak dapat saman kan ya
oh ya now is like the limit is wait is it still five or sekarang sudah buat sepuluh orang is it
actually if I'm not wrong now kalau wedding kan then we can have up to fifty people right
oh so sekarang means ikut shift ah dia punya macam wedding or like
oh cause from what I know is like next week I have a jemputan
cause from what they told me is that now only I think about lima puluh
the table sudah nak kena be err separated
kat your instagram story right pasal err the new system
you get certain score and all that then doesn't make you eligible to masuk like
if you understand then you can explain a bit lah macam
err cause both of us are going off field and all that then kat dalam hutan
sudah lah tak ada signal tak ada handphone pula
tak akan nak check news kan I mean news is legitly the last thing on my mind
just give me the opportunity to jumpa new people to interact more with err
tak wasted lah ya I really get to use it to
kalau if you ask me personally whether I would
give back more to the masyarakat
right I mean aku masih muda lagi
then what are the things like uh kau guys kau buat
what's the activities yang kau suka buat like say on a weekend lah ya
maybe go to the beach pergi jogging ke
okay pergi makan
cause I I I think I agree with you with that cause the moment you masuk camp
I think that's the one oh when my mum masak you know
like what my family suka buat kalau on weekends right is that
we usually try to make sure cause weekends is err bila everyone is
my adik and my mum they're free
err walking or cycling lah just around the area cause I stay err dekat dengan apa tu east coast
so kalau nak pergi beach pun err tak jauh sangat
kalau hujan lebat then okay lah that's when
make it like seimbang you know err just have a balance
kalau weekends you think about it you only have dua puluh empat jam
timing yang kita ada is definitely limited
kalau anything about pun I'm not so afraid to just bilang dia orang ah
eh last time dulu aku papa pun buat ini buat ini like last
ah dulu kalau nak pergi keluar nak kena march and don't know what
wait I I was also enlisted in tekong so jadi
my family also ikut pergi sampai tekong and then they all
mum and dad adik and my eh my adik
and my nenek my err makcik
then we went to the cook house then check the food then of course lah kalau first day kan
they all need to set a good impression for all the parents so dia orang give the best food lah that they have
then ah I remember that day wah boleh nangis seh
ah rindu lah haven't been so
all nyanyi-nyanyi right all bising-bising
no ours was ours dua belas I think
macam total check my financial spending ah and really pen down pen and paper what
think about it err the duit that I
err set aside for macam macam transport kan
then after that kalau transport there and back cause I don't know selalu aku take grab lah
err careful with the where you spend the duit lah
start menjimatkan wang lah uh especially now that
beli mcdonald's beli what all that it's just like
no no no tomorrow lah at the start then can go out beli baju kan
now err sebab all got the macam mana nak cakap the elections kan
cause err kalau you look at it right now
some of them like kasihan juga lah you look at them then they're like if they end up
err just buang all their duit during cause they ya our seniors ah
all buang their duit during then because of that when they they don't have as much then
and really err how to say err jaga your own money
I think for me like what you asked just now right uh tadi you said
cause definitely I really don't want to bebankan my parents financially lah and most of the
kalau extend contract kan jadi sampai cause
the idea is that err kalau we stay longer kat dalam camp
tapi mm tak tak sedap sangat
I mean tak it's not that bad
like uh tak jadi beban to your parents ah
tapi now
okay tapi now I feel like ya let's just talk about makanan ah really that's like my favourite thing to talk about
no I mean it's like sometimes it's like eh you want to go eat it's a it's a it's a it's not I'm not necessarily lapar or anything
tapi it's just a excuse for me to like
err jumpa kawan jumpa family
err eratkan silaturahim lah with people people that
like you say asalkan halal I'm steady lah
a'ah eh kampung food aiya nevermind lah bro
apa kalau kau beli rendang right it's like what one piece it's already like I I also don't know ah I think it's like three dollars at least
then worst is sotong
so you you buy sotong that time
bulan puasa then my family pergi geylang kan nak makan
nak okay not makan sorry nak beli untuk buka lauk ah
standard ah you'll pack away take away lauk right
call that err sotong right the
sotong hitam sotong hitam that was the big squid then it was like what
in my opinion ya sebab kalau lapar kan a quick fix
ya then sebab it's convenient
err stand in one row right then semua beli maggi then tambah telur
then the telur selalu macam tak masak apa the aunty will say eh setengah masak but it's like
obviously not cooked then we just kacau everything then makan terus
encik tan encik tan bro that's like the go to nasi
then after that it naik sampai berapa eh
sampai tujuh puluh lapan bro
there is no way right kau boleh belajar and study at the same time
ya is ya oh sorry makan dan belajar at the same time sorry
so jadi we had to make do with what we had then
usually kita beli what err just nasi campur
or the india punya makanan ah
what we had was what err nasi padang right
nasi padang and the asagani stall
oh do you remember when err dulu
when we used to beli the nasi goreng first right then we just ask eh ada nasi kway
cik ada nasi goreng ada kway teow goreng then she'll be like
eh ada ada okay okay err jangan bilang orang then we
suddenly it's like everyone knew what nasi goreng was
honestly it was I think it was a different type of nasi goreng I I don't haven't tried it outside yet
there's no nasi goreng that I've tried that does like that it's super spicy
hey it was a super spicy nasi goreng
bulan puasa bro
okay bukannya susah sangat
betul betul okay understand
I try to masak lah sometimes cause when I'm at home
especially when I got oh actually I won't say it's masak but I try to bake when I have the time to
ya some things I did was eh that time remember bulan puasa
I made err err suji for everyone
because tak boleh agak how much err ramuan you need right
and all the sukatan-sukatan all that was very obscure to me
and some are online recipe ya first time buat then they say eh
ya ya that's true that's that's very tiny tiny suji right
then sudah sudah sudah habis buat then dia punya what you call that
when I made the err the whole aduan right it was a bit
so when I tried to make kuih for the first time that's what happened ah then the suji came out
I stay in the east area then this amshar pula tinggal kat
apa woodlands kan jauh gila so obviously
nak naik train pun I took like one and the half hours so
wah memang but that day sempat lah
sempat sempat balik bedok by buka seh
cause I left quite late I remember oh then I stopped by ang mo kio I wanted to meet tok mat to pass him the suji then he gave me another whole
um what you call that a whole container of kuih tart in return so
what was it ah it was oh hari raya oh I was I had leave
ya is no bro is the eve of raya bro
eh tak boleh ah I got interview then I was like oh okay lah then I go to your house ah
nasib baik I remember where you stay sia
actually this kind of thing also honestly I a bit kekok but but why did the the baking thing was that
suji for myself it's just dah
tak masuk akal lah for me to eat everything oh what
ya for everything on my own obviously I eat one or two sudah a bit muak sikit kan
let's say kalau I'm outside kan then I see people macam
need help especially older people naik naik bus that kind of thing then angkat the bag all like go inside right
paiseh kan because if you think about it eh ah memandai jer nak tolong
then err obviously she understands that aku pun nak she understands that aku pun nak tolong dia kan
kalau the makanan kan is halal right it will be less
but then err aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang right
ya ambil hati also then they also tak nak
eh actually I feel bad macam I I don't I
ah kari asam pedas bro that that nestle ice cream container got asam pedas
but tapi kalau you
ya but then err the my other halal option is uh mamak lah
mamak stall lah bro supper club
ah infomercials that's why there's kalau kau tengok jamaah kan one suria and all that
so obvious eh like eh ah abang
err susu biasa lah tak payah pakai
ha ha I think I see this most often about my nenek lah
ya they they I mean in general my nenek cooks everyday
for for starters my nenek is quite open to all this also
kan ada tetamu datang obviously you have to prepare something right for them
but because we sudah bawa makan
ya tak payah susah sangat
you know we used to beli ah sweet talk semua kat bawah block kan
ya only if you use like special discount ke
okay kalau sudah ada kahwin okay sudah kahwin pun boleh lah
ya masak tak akan hari-hari nak masak maggi
I saw your posting bro not bad ah kau dengan kau punya baju suit semua very classy eh not bad eh
berapa lama kau kerja sana ah
ye ke tapi aku dengar dorang cakap saudi arabia is a very corrupted country tau
cause ya I saw a lot of news right especially the the prince kan the prince sulaiman he a lot of controversies about him and then you know now his his other neighbouring countries the arab countries ah have a lot of war and then his ties with the america nya
arab countries but anyway I mean I think this is too much of a politic abeh kau bila kau kat saudi arabia selain solat kau buat apa sana
oh so if you were given another chance kau will travel saudi arabia or would you like to try negeri lain
so speaking of football kan abeh orang-orang main bola ni semua dorang masih main ke dorang pun dah stop macam kita orang juga
ah negara luar macam messi ronaldo ni semua kan dorang masih main ke or they have to you know take a pause from this cause of the COVID pandemic
tapi sementara jer bro cause ah
kalau kau tengok betul-betul eh sekarang kau tengok electric punya tariff dah naik nine point three per cent abeh so I think the government will first
for for them lah but I mean we have no choice we have to make do of what we can abeh sekarang ni kau kerja apa ninja van eh
oh savings eh tapi slowly your savings will also
jadi kurang kan abeh kau tak worry ah
tak bro that one was just uh interview that I went to went for
um not bad lah you know I think there's more opportunities in the healthcare industry so why not aku just try to continue so for now aku just uh aku kerja as a clinic assistant ah
which is quite tough ah banyak patients and
you know banyak demands
the protected gear ah eh and then uh quite safe ah kau kau kalau ikut all the safety protocols ah everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved ah I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since aku tak pernah ambil semua seh so aku maybe ah my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
mm kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun there's a lot of a
uh and it's been a growing trend ah I see a lot of uh races actually uh branching into this line cause selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja grab food pun ye lah orang-orang kita kan betul tak
tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja at least gaji aku eh aku at least rasa kena at least two point five and above ah itu pun depends kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja normal is quite risky ah kalau kau kerja macam
err gaji yang one K plus jer unless if you only living with your wife
mm that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays ah you know our generations especially tapi if you were to think about it
know the traditions tu yang susah tu the culture of our our race kan kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves abeh macam mana seh nak sustain kalau ada anak semua kan nak kena bayar bill
bayar susu diapers semua I mean of course definitely they they you know dapat baby bonus ni semua tapi berapa lama seh boleh tahan
tak boleh tahan kan aku rasa
ya but singapore pun
I mean kau kena faham-faham ah singapore dorang akan kasi kau grants for free nya apa
err like sekarang kau tengok dorang dah increase traffic eh electricity nya price nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik so but I mean the government they are doing their best lah I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country kan to remain at the top
abeh no choice ah
government I think government will try their best lah but we we still have to find ways ah no matter what aku rasa
kita kena hustle ah this is a hustling years lah just like macam dulu ah time SARS zaman SARS dulu pun dorang
economy pun jatuh tapi kau tengok slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves ah we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it ah orang cakap
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing dah berapa jer
tapi personally aku tak tahu ah aku rasa
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body ah mentally physically aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak exercise tak you know take their time to you know relax to ease off kalau tak
kau pun boleh terjejas ah kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk ah
macam lagi ramai orang I mean dorang dorang memang susah pe so I think macam aku nak cakap dorang dah get used to it lah abeh tapi I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
uh wealthily macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini kan then dorang macam terus jadi stress sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini kan
dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah so dorang might know what to do or might hustle even like normally ah they do like hustle really hard tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja
high position semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh survive kan gini so that's why dorang stress kan
and then we have to fight through ah and speaking of which kan berbual pasal COVID aku recently baca news trump kena COVID is it true
aku tengok ah siol tapi the thing is kenapa china buat macam gini eh I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions macam I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
apa ni world
organisations eh yang the one with apa united nations is it
dorang pun are against it tau abeh aku tak faham kenapa they are still doing this eh but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care ah aku just buat ni tak ada orang boleh stop aku
so even though aku might say that I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china kan aku might side with trump ah just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims kan
then aku rasa it's it's it's really cruel ah but I don't know why kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini eh
which are aku rasa it's just too much ah to be honest this is just like macam zaman-zaman dulu seh if kalau kau belajar history kat secondary school semua kan kalau kau belajar kau tengok ah hitler kau tengok macam orang macam um stalin of what they have done
so it's aku rasa it's just it's just effed up ah aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak ah aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman serious
sebab setahu aku eh
the black err civil rights activist ni semua they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people macam
aku rasa tak tahu eh macam
that's what I heard also ah macam apa ni dia ada counterfeit nya duit kan
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police dekat america is being
ah so kalau aku rasa kalau kau as an american kan kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu ah macam mana
aku tak aku tak imagine kalau this situation were to happen in singapore
kita sikit jer dah riot dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu country
apa lagi kalau legit kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau witness kita nya own singapore police buat gini confirm kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap
ah aku rasa
I think it memang exist ah aku rasa the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism ah it it will happen in all countries in all places and aku rasa that's why the government
tapi nak buat macam mana kalau government tak tekun dengan dia punya laws semua kan tak tak really ah
be serious about this then aku rasa kita nya country
will be like other countries ah I mean let's just look at our neighbour ah malaysia kau tahu malaysia sendiri kalau
okay aku sendiri melayu kan aku tak nak cakap
tapi aku rasa the malay rights over there it's
it's belittling the other races ah tak tahu ah aku rasa dari malaysia
so kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata kan aku cina eh abeh aku nak beli rumah aku malaysia citizen tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar extra mahal sebab aku cina
eh a'ah betul juga eh
macam dorang tak bersyukur eh macam apa dorang dapat
that's what aku personally see lah or feel bila aku when aku tengok kat news
err videos on the internet what what kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak
and it's sad to see ah tapi aku tak faham ah kenapa najib dia dia dah kena tangkap kan aku dengar dia dapat confirm he's dia dah found guilty kan
it's just so chaotic macam tak ada orang control seh macam those pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah parliament lain
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what aku tak faham ah macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa seh macam
boleh dorang ada orang macam gini to represent eh
mm aku pun nampak ni dekat facebook or youtube ah
but ah I think it's on twitter tapi how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
but aku aku really wonder how
ah recruitment and the position that is of power ah macam ni semua position important important seh abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh just get away with all these things
if you were given a choice eh kau will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
the money money wise I think what I would do aku would probably kerja kat singapore
tapi um
tapi aku would live there so aku can know have a lot of make a lot of more money ah abeh aku boleh spend
ah tu eh that's true eh aku rasa I mean
tapi if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position ah which you have to climb eventually
aku rasa it's all about
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever tapi
ah currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can uh I think it's more important for me to focus on myself ah sia I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend abeh aku tak boleh sustain mata air aku
then teruk ah puas hati aku ada banyak duit then aku boleh ada girlfriend then aku boleh you know
kita dua-dua boleh enjoy
tapi ya lah
then what kau kau ada mata air
know we we may not kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga
people who are happily in the relationship together they dorang macam relax jer tak post apa-apa just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily ah
to tengok orang macam gini semua kan I think ada segelintir ah mungkin dorang macam rasa the same thing tapi
ada juga ah golongan yang you know uh having good relationships ah so aku rasa kau should give a try tapi ye lah likewise you know aku rasa sekarang tengah susah kan so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself ah
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever tapi
for my race but entah aku rasa macam
tak boleh ah kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap
you know tunjuk yang kita boleh lead anak orang betul tak
tapi no choice ah this is how
we uh most parents are dealing with their child cause kita pun nak kena survive pe nak cari duit it's all about money ah singapore is all about being financially stable ah and that sacrifice have to be made ah kalau kau nak
so aku rasa that's why some cultures they
abeh uh
abeh macam uh
dah terpaksa ah aku rasa it's dah macam
dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita ah sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah so
that's why aku rasa financial planning is very important kita kena plan sekarang before having a kid you know not just funfair buat lepas tu at last kita susah then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu
and to have a beautiful family ah tu aku rasa ah um yup
on your end kau rasa apa
kau ambil train ke kau ambil
bro jangan kuat sangat
ya tak aku ingat kau jalan dengan kat sini
aku mimpi aku pregnant babe then the mimpi was so real is like macam kau tahu bila kau tengah give birth
ya I can feel the pain it's sakit gila babe
ya habis baby tu keluar babe I I don't know who is the father also but ya itu jer lah mimpi aku
err nobody ah it's just me and the baby and some other people that aku tak kenal
dia macam baby biasa I guess like anak perempuan habis cute tapi nakal ah habis dia minta susu dengan aku selalu
no leh it's more of like I have to jaga this baby
ya aku memang mimpi pasal baby banyak ah aku tak tahu apa pasal but in real life aku memang macam tak nak anak ah
mm ya lor but then aku suka budak-budak apa and I like to spend time with them but I don't know right ya yes
cause aku dulu suka buat macam that kind of like diary entry like from that year or whatever
very like ya reflective and macam gini
all right lah yang benda-benda bodoh ah macam
aku rasa aku masih dengan azee seh
so aku aku just dengan kawan aku aku remember ya about her and then like
ya lor but then um ya aku rasa
like are you still friends with that girl the kawan aku kan uh but like
but dulu sec four kau ada macam mimpi-mimpi eh impian-impian ke
see lah my english all berterabur already
mm I think very small things like kalau
orang tu macam tak text aku balik or what I think aku fikir yang bukan-bukan but then I aku macam don't act on it lah but sometimes I'll I'll be
even though you think maybe it's something personal but kau try to
a'ah satu hari tu kat bus aku tak tahu kalau kau ingat ke tak aku tweet pasal perempuan ni kat bus habis dia macam
tak nak jalan babe dia macam tak nak give aku way habis
in the end like dia tak nak duduk dia tak nak duduk tak apa tapi banyak seats kat belakang then bila banyak seats kat belakang aku geram lah macam apasal kau tak nak kasi aku jalan eh
and then me being passive aggressive aku macam
okay lah tak apa ah aku just diri habis aku jeling-jeling kat dia
then terus bila orang turun dia duduk dekat depan babe
at last dia duduk so pun tak apa
aku tak tahu maybe around like younger than me
she saw me she saw me and then dia macam nak buat macam you know muka yang macam
mm step tak nampak aku gitu
aku stare dia seh aku dah macam minah red aku dah keluar habis
habis what about you
aku rasa macam you're the least petty person ever
or like me zaman dulu lah because
ya ya bila aku dengan zee I mean like this girl nama apa eh nama dia apa eh aku lupa tapi dia kawan zee
then this girl dia macam tak nak tegur aku tak nak say hi even though I said hi to her so I don't know her personally what right
exactly it's because dia cakap ah apa ni aku date zee that's the reason why she don't like me even though I'm julie's friend
nasib baik buat apa call aku eh
dah lah it's okay lah don't have the red one lah
but then ex kau yang lagi satu
okay but if if I were to choose I think aku nak macam to be able to speak
and also kau boleh baca quran babe
I can play ah but sikit-sikit jer it's not like mastered level tahu ah
oh ya I got the semangat one
but kau tahu berenang
aku tahu float jer
err about james charles dia kan suka nyanyi tapi nyanyi dia macam tak sedap kan so he went to a vocal coach
allowance berapa lama ni
sixteen seconds bodoh bagus
siapa seh aku nak jadi I'm already an actor myself in real life I think normal
apasal seh
aku tahu tapi I didn't like
so it's like okay lah kan nothing wrong with that but I think because we older already so we don't really macam judge too harshly
like you wake up as them but you're still yourself rabak though then suddenly I can speak malay
that will make the news you know wah stray kids can speak malay one tiba-tiba
like tak payah pergi kerja ah
ya I think aku so
aku rasa aku kasi therapy ah
tapi are we allowed to talk about singapore like that
out of the boss gitu lah
itu lah
tapi kita tak tahu what type of zombie
gigi siol putih
tapi kau boleh tak dah hafal channel dah hafal cerita dah hafal script
dry and terkopek and already putih
ya you will lose melanin and then like kau jadi putih ah
hello what's up who can help me kau berbual kuat
imagine the engineer yang kita tak suka dia knock knock kat aku bila tengah tidur

yes I have thought about it if like if it's others others eh if it's other powers I think it's like macam okay lah if it's like creative if it's like gini gini like I I don't need all that ah
so imagine you in a crowd you already rimas
then ghosts lagi-lagi hari-hari tengok kau macam eh and kau boleh nampak sia ke apa ee
I only know one guy dia boleh macam dia memang boleh nampak but dia and you can kind of see dia macam claus dia macam depressed dia macam mm ya
so macam kesian ah
but he's very like I think he has that since young lah so dia macam dah biasa in a way but
ya I know lah some of them macam they everytime will find an opportunity to just say eh kat belakang kau ada benda or whatever but I can tell lah that is fake lah
I think I tak tahu lah maybe dia orang gila ah nak attention but then why would you want attention that way
like I remember that time I met my boyfriend there and then he was like eh kau tahu tak boyfriend kau ada macam lembaga hitam dekat belakang dia then I was like
apasal eh lembaga hitam dia cakap dia ada something lah kat like his aura or something
ya it was like twirling like mario macam bagai
I was twenty twenty three he would be twenty dia nineteen eighty nine so berapa tu
uh he's the same lah tak ada apa-apa lah dia ex yang paling boring untuk aku

tapi I haven't really like used it fully because circuit breaker
bila kita jewel ah
okay lah itu enam kali ah
lepas ni so sekarang tak boleh okay
not all also lah cause dia orang cakap macam terbelit-belit also still
so tak faham pun but
kasih dengar the autotune
err my I think the only like studio that can fit that is neapolis atau infinite eh studios I don't know
and he went to korea without like any money or anything so macam
and he tak even go for like classes to belajar you know he just like
if we go korea but I don't think we will be able to handle dia orang punya
if you ikut macam the business like module
ya the food punya
itu jer
macam you buy one and the second glasses you get fifty percent off
ambil and try
tak bagi like anybody just masuk tahu so you have to like
queue to masuk
sakit everything they keep saying they keep separating
satu is one species another one is another species
if there's fifteen migrant worker yang kena
they are exposed to tak akan migrant workers jer kan
everyday macam add one two people like in the community cases kan
macam some kind of investigative like journalist gitu
and then we all will mati together
I don't know macam as we grow older I guess
what the world is then we get macam
aku lagi penat daripada kau you know I did more things than you yesterday and I'm like
ya pasal lah penat
cause I don't know if I can do this anymore film penat sia
there's this macam
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which mazhab you're looking at also
pasal if you're talking about
like kita punya mazhab memang we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
there's other mazhab that's like
like this idea of mazhab is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
that's like my question because the mazhab thing came about because of
macam concerns lah
then is the mazhab thing going to change or what
a set in stone thing cause the mazhab thing was never like set in stone
people there might adopt our mazhab punya practices
she will be adopting other mazhab practices and when she comes back here
just about sembah this one tuhan
and believing in our prophets our rukun iman and rukun islam
touching a dog is haram so ya that's like my
macam over
to be fair kasihan ah dia dia macam
sec one lepas tu kena COVID terus tak ada friends you know she don't have proper friends in school
this is like there is a goal punya cerita after that
and she had this other boyfriend and the boyfriend she was together for like five years tahu
the whole family was like oh dia dia minum arak dia pergi
apa dia makan drugs semua that kind of thing you know and then when we met him I was like he was crying
ah you tak tak ada choice lain ke apa like
you know I macam
that lady was cantik lah and she was with us for three years
like kau tak ada perempuan lain ke apa that you want to go for this maid who doesn't want you back
I'm like kau dah tua stop it lah
tak tahu asian pun boleh suka asian asian girls
that kind of guys will be like oh nanti kita dah kahwin boleh masakkan I lah

you think I kahwin ni mesti nak masak sambal goreng
kau kelakar ke apa you know
the I'll be like oh ah lah I degree tapi film jer film jer you know that kind of thing

not working um working lah working from home ah err kira work from home
um ya lah basically macam bake cake ah kebanyakan bake cakes
then err lagi macam jual baju ada jual baju juga um
jual baju is on facebook live you've seen that facebook live before right ya so
I do like baking habis baking is like when people want to order from me they can just
contact me ah dekat instagram or carousell they can find me there and then
wait for them I will make lah pasal sometimes because I'm also like working part time as well like juggling three jobs at the same time oh my god
as of now sekarang ah I prefer baju jual baju
sebab um
baking and then macam very penat it's very tiring ah very tiring then I need err actual like
okay lah so I need actual kitchen dia macam tempat pun tak ada then
I love baking I still love baking but inshallah like in the future kalau if I have err a kitchen space then I maybe will continue back my baking is not I stop baking lah I'm still baking lah it just that now only once a month twice a months
will will apa maju english
um for now kan I sell facebook live sahaja kan so in the future I will do mostly like um okay how to I like attract more customer is it
live won't die off but if it does die off kalau dia die off kan um I already dah macam ada my customer base I already have I dah ada so even if the facebook live die off they can come over to my shop they already know my name my name is well known ready
I know which right now currently sekarang tiktok is doing it
tiktok has a live um ya tapi for one thousand followers and above
not in the future during the future I think it will apa banyak orang akan jual barang dekat tiktok
but ya the part ah the part where you said um body body builders pakai instagram is tadi cakap
actually it's true you know because I I don't know why I think it was back I was like really into those yang bikin body bikin body
ya kalau beli phone baru pun is better I feel like beli phone can buy camera apa camera yang good quality
that's why I also like planning to buy new phone juga with a good quality camera on the phone which I do not know tapi I kena find out lah
oh oh it got contract or just the phone itself oh oh I dengan contract I ada contract
no what I want to err what err err a a phone with camera sebab kan I cakap I ada facebook live kan
so I can take pictures of my clothes take good quality I mean sekarang I can use my phone to take good quality ah but it's not good quality it is just a picture which is nice but it's not a good quality picture
okay but my one I have no problem sekarang sebab I have microphone I have microphone
what sekarang my camera quality for me macam tak apa uh not bad okay cuma kena ada good wi-fi
connection if wi-fi connection is not good dia akan
so that's why sometime you see my video will be like macam err a bit not good quality sebab wi-fi connection wi-fi connection is important
like that is apa kena pakai wi-fi connection more daripada mobile data kalau mobile data bila pakai dia lagi rabak dia punya lagging
benda-benda yang I tak tahu I pun tengok youtube juga ya so macam ya because so come back to youtube juga of course tapi macam mana eh you nak jual baju dekat youtube
tapi I nak phone baru mainly sebab I nak ambil gambar of this baju yang I ada okay I'm not concerned about
the live punya video
apa live video quality I'm not concerned about that that much sebab so far all the phone kalau yang rabak pun dia punya quality is very good I'm concerned about pictures that coming out and gonna post it on my facebook
no lighting is a need as well tapi I really have lighting okay I already have lighting I just need to learn more
eye to see which one is nice which one is not ah you sendiri have to tengok sendiri lah mana satu yang cantik mana satu tak for free
you ingat photoshop senang you ingat photoshop senang
tak kenapa you cakap dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
kenapa you berbual dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
you talking to someone yang belajar photoshop so why you saying that guy that way
yang mop canteen mop canteen
you know what reminds me of my sekolah time sunrise sunrise sunrise kan a'ah sunrise
is a kitchen so you have to clean up our clean up is like thorough clean up as well um sapu
lepas tu mop lepas tu cuci all the pan pots all wash
no flour on it make sure there's no dust or flour it just like okay and then jap when you cakap macam gitu teringat macam oh okay macam sama kat sekolah aku pun sama bikin gitu
know the rubbish bin all that right err so kita again ah upper aside those ya not so basically we will most of the time we will ask like
um everyday we have our own leader you know everyday we have you know like if if if apa ni primary school ke secondary school prefect prefect secondary school
eh secondary pun ada eh
so like prefect kan macam everyday kita ada prefect dekat sekolah tu walaupun it's already a a
ikut dia punya register number something like that so it's not loser basically this person do right is like everyday dia akan assign like
okay the four of you will do the pots and pans the four of you will mop the four of you will do this ataupun okay the four of you will collect the ingredients the flour and put on top okay the four of you
there's a term for that we don't call monitor or president other term other term I lupa apa chef entah apa chef I lupa but I hate it when it comes to my turn
no I'm not I'm the most macam no um the most shy because like in the morning I have to be talking to all of them like as if like I'm the leader sia I have to talk like okay I'm the leader you guys have to listen to me I'm not that kind of person what I'm not
so macam bila part I jer macam macam mana ah macam mana ah everytime is my turn I will be like ah shit I'm so scared I'm so scared I will get like anxiety macam
panic uh macam mana macam mana but the hal is everytime dah dapat tau everytime dah dapat because it rotates what
even if I don't want to lead then I'll be like macam on lah very on very kiasu you know
tapi kan macam ini macam tak ada pilihan langsung everyday orang rotate orang yang ada yang lagi pemalu daripada I
yang very shy super timid ada that one also like
but that we as a as the dia punya classmate tak ada macam
wah this one wah rabak sia cannot sia cannot sia we don't kita akan macam
for for example lah nama dia michelle eh michelle we would encourage her would be macam michelle it's okay you tell me what you want me to do you tell me I sitting beside you you tell me
ya time sekolah that's why I really love at sunrise you know at sunrise it's like the most amazing school I mean okay maybe the school is not really amazing tapi I punya classmate is the most amazing classmate ever so I macam happy gila
time secondary school primary school jangan cakap lah paling merepek
huh okay part buli in singapore is not that rabak hmm kalau buli in malaysia is the most rabak eh
okay lah let him be lah okay I don't know what happen to him now it's been years already hopefully okay dah berubah
I still feel so stupid you know I'm like I'm I'm staying at choa chu kang tapi asal I jauh
I apply something at balestier I do not know why got the other one at balestier and then suddenly balestier ni pindah for the second year pergi dekat yang college central
hujung sekali kalau kelas you hujung sekali your canteen is hujung sini
to my defense I didn't know sebab bila I uh apa apply for this sekolah dia orang cakap oh this diploma is recognisable everywhere in singapore outside of singapore is recognisable wah but when apply kerja horrible
no they do not recognise ah apa private diploma singapore don't recognise private diploma even kawan-kawan I yang kerja
eh yang
yang apa yang M yang macam you know is private juga kan ataupun apa
entah lah that one private also kan that one also not recognise tau sebab private
tapi is like quite the amount is so much for a private but then end up you don't use my for you you korang bagi kerja korang tak nak accept
takde lah
takde lah culinary job is I understand
so I understand that part is like macam okay lah but then
so now you are saying like okay you do not know what is happening okay so I bilang
basically alah macam banyak job banyak jer orang yang tak ada kerja but I tak tahu lah maybe I'm looking at the wrong places mungkin my agents are not really good
no ya that's why like most of them macam I wanna leave singapore I don't want to stay at singapore or something but to live at singapore you need job honey
a'ah like dia cepat-cepat sangat dia progress
ah I'm grateful that we jadi ita tak ke belakang tau jadi kita tak ada slow
future kids you know future grandchildren you know dia orang akan dapat macam a lot of privileges lah and then same time makan maju lagi cepat dari kita lagi
pintar pintar eh wow bahasa melayu pintar is pintar is pandai lah ya I don't know tiba-tiba
ya lah nak pakai lah ni pandai okay pandai tapi
ya but I'm seriously like grateful lah sebab singapore macam very multiracial multiracial and then macam we don't we don't really have like racial discrimination amongst the
for me singapore job is ah ya ya a bit difficult for me to get singapore job sebab kena banyak mandarin mandarin kena banyak berbual mandarin then macam
okay so ni lisa ni like how I don't think the the
I I've I seen phone cases where you can um like print macam pictures on the phone case I'm thinking that you are saying like macam a picture sort of thinkers the frame pictures that's what
that's what sarah is saying right and then ah dekat
plaza sing there is um the kedai tingkat dua depan pizza hut where you can make
ya correct kalau macam can
a tote bag with our pictures then they go to like macam supermarket
macam aww I have my tribe with me while I go buy some bawang
photo book you you you are right cause I have friends who give me photo book I look it on memories aww then cry then after that taruk dalam kotak and then like
when you clean up your house baru buka oh ya I remember this rachel give it to me two years ago ah what
I think kita like err we can just do
okay I think got like dua minggu to
the way she's guarded now is like ah whatever ah sembarang ah on ah go jer like she she she ya
eh lighter mana like lighter mana
ya ya ya and then I just she she tried to be the again the the the kakak kakak like trying to make jokes I was just like
ya ya I I nearly had that with sarah with the whole bali thing with the whole tini and the bali thing and all that cause I I macam
meeting tini was just like a coincidence thing cause she dia dia kerja dekat the hostel kat mana ni clarke quay then I was working kat lima pe
so I I know that tini has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like eh babe come ah lepak ah like
ah apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima like we can just like hang out eh no that time habis kerja siang two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like haji lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in bali when me and azmi left so when me and azmi was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us tak ada apa-apa lah no lah nothing dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like macam orh this jas guy is nice memang he he he is a very lepak guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with tini cause we asked tini face to face so all these while when tini like when we when me and her hung out ah like she like oh dekat bali this happened and then he give me all these
tini macam ah macam oh dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking dia dia lupa pe sial kita like in a group ya correct then um like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just diam I just cause she she
ah she was just basically macam member lah eh jas gini gini gini I don't know I have ah macam you know commitment issues tini like of course lah kan dia dengan dia punya commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know ah this happen and then she's like oh jas told me dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah hey cause dia lupa sia correct then I
when I hear all these things from tini I'm like bullshit bullshit sial lah dia ni puki betul budak
so at some point no we hung out kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga
sabar sabar sabar sabar so
at at some point tini said this sentence um jas cakap dengan aku um macam uh I never felt like this for a girl before dia cakap gitu that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then tini just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan sarah babe
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual lah dia cakap gitu then at at some point I told sarah sarah
cause what me and azmi told her was that actually jas and tini tak ada apa-apa but when we were there memang they really like
they they told me to they told to our face eh tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas
ya jas dengan tini and then when we left back when me and azmi left first then they stay in bali apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her lah
ah so dia masih dia dia fikir dia casanova this guy sana like that so um
she just went her minah lah she did became the minah
err dia salahkan jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so ah ya then then that night happened and
ya then I'm like kau nak pergi berbual dengan sarah buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan jas I say like that dia yang buat problem pe like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to tini which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with err sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and dekat rumah dia dekat yang percil tu ah we we lepak we hung out
ah I am what was the word she used um macam berbual belakang dia ah like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole um
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like aku rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask azmi you can ask nisa or whoever was there at your birthday lah that was your birthday right my intention was really eh sarah this this happened to sarah okay sekarang like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and azmi in confident and I go out macam to her aku
ah macam lan jiao wei pasal dia babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation ah what I macam ah what I ah take from it is that ah sarah and sarah is dia always takut err she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel lah this is just my personal
um macam um how to say eh macam um
no no no like macam dia jaga conduct
like like her way her her image is dia nak kena jaga conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one ah ah I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not nangis to azmi but macam I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told azmi that I I I I know this is my niat but sometimes kadang-kadang niat baik but um you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
from then onwards I I macam I ah back off sort a little bit to really
ya ya correct cause correct tini told me ya sorry tini tini told me that um macam I've I don't open up to guys one like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she senyap this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
um like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the laksa thing we were having I was pissed off lah I feel like macam you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you macam nak buat sial kat kau you know but
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still eh jom ah lepak even though for months you been eh come ah we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
kau cakap dengan aku pasal something I don't go to ni
ah no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my macam um my intentions to ah
we and it for us like sometimes oh we talk about tini macam gini
but gossip is kau tahu dia ni
um in our macam friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me macam
ah hati dia like she wants to jaga her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
eh bilang aku bilang aku you know
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to gaduh ya and any relationship will have that macam you know macam ah ah apa err what what's that word ah friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to gaduh in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where apa aku cakap too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
kan pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas ah nak cakap nak kena
like you lah kita nak main game tak nak main ah jangan banyak cakap
kalau azmi lagi whoa
no I think he's macam sial
why why kenapa like why are you so macam anti natural things

actually it's very funny I was cause last weekend we were talking about kalau kita dah tua like duduk mana like you know and we just lepak somewhere where you know there's the sea or something you know um I was I was it's just funny I was just thinking about this if really like money is
sort of macam not a problem sort of right like I would probably macam ah tanam basil tanam
thyme tanam apa err daun bawang lah apa lah you know shit like that and then I will learn it on youtube cause like hello everything is on youtube so it's everywhere exactly ya there's facebook groups you can just join and like eh apa pasal aku punya aku punya daun ni macam senget tepi or something like that you know like
and then I will just I would probably I I picture myself like okay if let's say kat indonesia ke malaysia right
mmhmm just go to like a local school like you know ah ah ajar english ke
riding things like that macam dah sapu rumah
sapu then like err eh jom ah so time to go teach english or you know
lepak ya ya ya I see myself
ya but also it's difficult to jaga ant
he will just macam the kind of macam romeo
jangan bang jangan jangan bang ow jangan bang
main jer
pangkeng pangkeng balik rumah uncle pangkeng
then macam save duit satu minggu sekolah
save lima dollar lima dollar weekend pangkeng ah
ya it's a term that ah like minah
or you naik rumah uncle ah
rumah uncle apa sia rumah uncle
ah rumah uncle balik rumah uncle rumah uncle
or like another matrep err slang ah aku kicap kau eh gua kicap sama lu
muka kau kasih kicap eh
terus macam kau I remembered the first
time someone used that word kampung
but err we we wrote letters to each other right cause dulu tak ada tak ada social media
you know asal kau berbual dengan dia ni ah
then I'm like ah kita tulis surat ah then after that she's like tak ada sekarang kau kau dari mana punya kampung
gua mahu turun sekarang then
apa sia kampung
then she like kau kampung pun tak tahu sial kau ah kampung dia cakap gitu
terus aku then I felt so uncool I put down the phone and then I go ask my kakak angkat what is kampung so apparently ah kampung is like ah
kau budak mana it's like where are you
ah which gang are you from or like which area are you from you from like that lah then I was like oh abeh kira kita ni kampung apa aku tanya kakak angkat aku
and then ah she like kita budak marsiling ah cause last time I stay with my with my auntie ah in in woodlands vista point area then budak kita budak marsiling ah
then in my head in this secondary one two tak nak ah marsiling tapi kita tinggal woodland jauh seh dengan marsiling
I jalan and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that kan dia macam you can see from their face macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down tangga saw me
and then dia macam stop in the middle of tangga then I'm like uh turun jer lah kan
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like macam old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing ah ya so like that
ya marsiling punya
marsiling gua kicap sama lu budak toa payoh
that one cina cina one ah I think
my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me macam cause
their their eyes is like apa kau buat kat sini so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
this group of boys tak ada judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like macam
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like boleh duduk diam like what sepuluh minit lima belas minit
but after that if they want to go down they want to lepak so they bring this boy to the playground main catching babe
main catching dengan budak-budak kat playground main bola main apa then I'm like
they even suss out um not influencers but artist sort of from other schools macam not famous but like one one thousand two thousand followers
and they do hip hop ke beatboxing they gather all these people come to hwa chong and they did a fundraiser all the money that we pay is like five dollars ten dollars goes to real life stories

eh macam like there's everyday there's a lot of different variation because everyday they focus on different things
ya that's why I I like really enjoy because like somemore with the environment everybody macam just doing their own apa ni doing their own workout ya and then the instructor
err just walk around and then dia kata
come on guys let's do it gitu aku macam tak it's it's more of like an australian accent

aku ambil saturday kau ambil sunday ya
err actually it's like multi roles lor macam that time kita dulu kat kerja
no I was just thinking okay because my main rationale kan was I I mean I could have sign a bond with like hospital tapi my main rationale behind not signing a bond because I don't wanna decide on myself too too early because I'm still year one
apa ni work style environment right so I am trying to trying to like keep my options open for now first lah
tak nak like suddenly tiba-tiba
macam sign to a place ah then menyesal

one and a half minutes tapi macam
kita punya recording ah
I want to say tak monday aku ada itu ambil course malam tu
tak boleh tak boleh cause currently is already practical right then they say err practical lesson takleh miss oh but monday onwards they taking live blood
the other time kat mannequin mannequin so taking each other
entah agaknya ah aku takut gila sia
oh tabik salute
tak apa it's okay good things await for those who
time semua orang tak ada kerja lain
ya so he was on my list like eh local uh local account lah like eh this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the dia punya videos was all quite macam angsty ah like
oh you see this vulgar tat tut tat semua basically like macam all the people like being annoying lah time dia tengah nak deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of dia pergi tampines mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and pasal tu time kan so we cannot go out kan and I was like oh my god I've never seen tampines mall look like that
ya serious macam like like some horror story is here
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like malam-malam buta like nine plus I was like eh this guy doing live live what sia
because at that point in time I just thought macam he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like oh wow wow he cause it
yes abang grabfood
and I think the funniest part was that um based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind yang like cause of like his friends dulu kat secondary school semua kan and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like apa ni bro
he actually he has the beng vibes but the most kekek thing is like the way he talks is very macam narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
kelakar lah like
ya it's quite bahan actually
exactly so I think actually by right dia punya target audience is
all following you it's so scary you know oh my god like there was this kid dia macam
I was like I say asal this budak like freaking thirsty you know
macam dia kata come live with me apa apa apa then aku was like
eww then aku press dia punya profile then I was like oh my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya oh it was so scary so and then um so he me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk kan is macam corporate gila
tu lah pasal dekat dia tanya um in which area do you reside I was like reside eh
first off aku dah block dia I was like saying uh don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because uh and then semalam pun like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like ah eh awkward
technically ah I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation yang pakai kan but it's still very disturbing lah but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like tak layan and then he doesn't assume anything oh ya then he was like how do I address you ah aku was like how do I address you macam then
the next for me macam the automatic response is miss farizan takkan lah kan apa seh macam merepek sia
zan ah actually aku was like alamak aku terlupa nak tukar my um name pasal it's still zan A yang ikut my um and aku was like
alamak too late to change to air lah takpe takpe lah zan lah zan jadi lah
yes oh my gosh he was like I'm very tired right now but if I'm not wrong you asked me to call you zan right and I was just like yes senpai noticed me ah terima kasih terima kasih
a'ah I was like opocot aku jadi marauder I there's actually like no real function to it ah cuma macam bragging rights jer
a'ah so I macam ah my dreams
ya I was I was like planning kalau macam ini hari kan kalau aku jumpa dia I will be like grab ge</mandarin
probably dia macam siapa then aku was like confirm tu kena instant block
oh ni dia eh yikes
tampines that's why so dekat
ya actually dekat and I kind of roughly know macam tempat dia lepak
no lah not his but his route yes because like like kat kat tak banyak tempat yang that you can
like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs yang dekat the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king dekat the
so I don't know like actually his account macam supposed to be like educational ke apa at an entertainment but it's so true I think like now I can identify like know the back models and shit in case like aku yikes
ya and then there's the mat minah tiktok
is that is that the meaning of pull like can I pull you I don't know because I keep seeing it on my feed then aku macam what's this eh like
I macam pull apa eh macam pull follow ke apa ke macam but it's like those thirst trap punya videos
ah a'ah kan I tak faham
okay but macam maksud dia tu apa
I I was just thinking of the mat minah call
just macam
macam how did you discover that app do you remember
ya ya because macam at the start that was what it looked like kan it was macam in between musically and vine
macam there's the reputation kan
technically those people must be underage juga
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just macam by proximity like you know the few local
you're talking about macam algorithm dia
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post terus like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I macam okay all right
like then the subsequent macam views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one macam the benda-benda bodoh I don't tag it I just macam
ya so that's the thing right I was like wow I didn't know that tiktok ada live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched
ya so it's um it's really interesting it's like you know how um live eh no not live eh live and live ada like the likes kan but it's just macam free kan you press
jadi boleh spam ke apa entah so apa ni like tiktok ada like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
I don't think it's that much lah because like I said macam dia punya follower base is more like budak-budak kecil so macam he will he will say say like oh thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like oh thanks for the rainbow puke and I pun macam he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk sekarang pun like dah lagi mahal bro
so like everyone is always saying stuff like oh come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel lah kan and aku was like what is this thing he's talking about
you see that's why you should donate to me dia cakap kelakar gila dia macam his humour ya
and then like I think I finished my virtual punya class and macam they just started opening that time face to babad like
like middle of last year or something so I always like holy shit like how I know I I I uh I recognize the dance moves kan then I was like hey insyirah like is this afrobeat standard like ya macam how you know and all that then aku aku was telling her lah that I listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying oh it's that this studio da da da da so uh it took me like damn long like aku just took the information and just like buat bodoh ah until happened
and then phase two then aku was like okay if I were to do a dance class that is not a lindy I'm gonna do this
a super fast one and aku was like aku nak mati eh
after a long break it's just like rombak rombak and I was like ha
like and then like each five ada like segment ah then you cannot mix
then that one uh because you maintain two meters tak payah pakai mask
ya my lindy punya yang solo pun begitu uh our capacity is about twelve
so sama lah two meters and all that tak payah pakai mask tapi tu recently um because of uh partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then tu kena pakai mask ah pasal like contact
but itu pun they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance sikit jer partner ada ya
dah lama I tak joget penat gila sia I was like ugh
stamina dah turun muscle semua dah macam dah layu
that's the one yang I I started with ya so a lot of my songs are yemi alade songs ya
it's like wah I love him macam the dia punya beat dia punya percussion dia is like is like
it's not as tacky as like macam ada like dia punya ah rentak ah dia like kebak kebak means like cool
and macam I feel like dia orang punya bahasa is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like um the class introduced me to all new like new songs lah as in new and macam different artists ah artists that I don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
I don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists ke apa besides beyonce
ya oh my gosh okay so that's the other thing like I feel so macam at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
like that's the only thing kita boleh buat like hello excuse me hello police
ya so and macam the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind yang like having fun is more important
macam you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but macam he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
ya but he very cool lah macam even the not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no no no actually K K jap there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then zul is one of the teachers
then hakim also teaches like um dance fall but I don't like dance fall dance fall macam a bit macam sexy ah I macam oof
ya then okay it's quite kekek like last two days kan I went for the same studio I tried uh homerun choreo
that one like aku nak mati sia
the person kan like mellow she's a good dancer but dia punya ajar dia macam like from the get go is like super detailed
macam my brain cannot
macam badan angle tangan angle
ah kepala angle I macam ugh
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I macam
yes and loncat-loncat
then macam I felt so demoralized ah like it's so susah and like
so for me the thing is that like kalau stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
I think cause I'm not like a fan kan I just do it cause macam it looked interesting
and then the ones next to her friends semua they were like eh today I become chicken ah I was like that's not wrong macam a lot of them their position I'm just like kenapa ayam kenapa ayam
ya macam cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
sorry ah pekak
mmhmm apa-apa pun pekak
eh lupa ah K jap
no lah okay so ceritanya is apa tau this phone the near RAM only three gig
dia punya internal kalau bukan sixteen thirty two eh
and then eh I try to log in from outram sampai past series belum log in you
disconnect lag crash semua the whole cycle
whoa macam no ya so then I could I could I really cannot you like besides gaming macam
apa eh like it's just super laggy ah macam everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal err internal memory dia dah habis kan
so like literally I was running on entah something macam hundred of free space ke apa entah
exactly so that's why macam dia punya performance pun dah macam tahi ah
huh but anyway dah dua dah dua tahun ah
so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for macam work taruh like um prepaid ke apa kat dalam tu
because actually phone ni tak rosak ya it's just and after I bought it over I I can uninstall all the things I'm not using ya so
mm it's okay then now I found a new use for it lah because I was thinking eh macam mana kalau I want to game but I also want to watch his live
I akan dengar I just dengar suara dia jer
ya dah suara dia sedap
suara dia macam macam dia punya voice quality is very good
like macam okay K K uh I once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory M punya guide
macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak ah hmm
but this guy ah macam kau just dengar just like ya macam cool like night setting you know
ya but ini hari I think ini hari dia main muzik so
sekarang you you'll hear him like sing and stuff
macam daripada mana eh tiba-tiba kan
but like why dia need to pakai okay sorry no no no apa dia punya power actually
dia macam apa gravity ke
I was like huh macam-macamnya power dia
kalau kau kalau kau watch three a day
kalau twenty three sikit jer
eh kalau you tengok six a day tau six a day by right empat hari dah habis twenty four
kau rewatch eh
rasa macam escapism which I'm like oh macam I don't like to be too close to reality
it was the most merepek ah okay okay no that's not okay I take that back after seeing things that bandai has released recently that's not the most merepek
but it's the most macam fantasy lah like super idealistic you know macam the guy must must always get the girl and then ada rival ada love triangle
that's rude ya macam
habis orang mati one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
ya macam oh and then um they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere macam
because at that time kan that uh macam the way you pilot is still macam pakai macam like you driving gitu ah you akan pakai um got the apa macam clutch semua and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart macam the later on the animes kan they they used macam uh like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much lah you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it uh I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves ke apa entah like okay sure like that's fine
like macam if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like macam gitu lah they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like oh macam drop drop from the sky gitu like merepek
ya because it's mm it's a bit dia punya plot
there's then gundam got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the gundam sampai like
and then they continue macam star wars gitu ah so it's like wah the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya but that one was okay but it was macam eh a bit too that one a bit too fantasy ah
ya betul
ya it's always senang kalau nak cakap
because you're not in that situation apa
ya I see that a lot on twitter also macam they will like err retweet those those um am I am I am I an asshole punya post
and then dia orang just like throw the whole man away lah apa you know macam like ya like macam
I guess you can write that way but macam think about how that person is like going through right
ya macam kau they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something aku rasa
then macam huh okay itu jer like ya that's what I was thinking oh actually kalau I wanted to catch up session quite easy
and like the singapore people don't even the singapore punya what or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
ya but that's the thing lah macam
but macam it's very like we we call it like what anime typical lah canon typical violence
so macam entah leh
but our censorship selalu macam tu
kau rembat jer
kekek jer sia
ya like ho kita cool
kan kita dah besar
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like and stuff right they will put like macam sixteen then I said they will put the the like triggers kat bawah macam
it sound so weird but macam
like in the science textbook they always show you macam
alah benda tu macam benda biasa jer bagi dia
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about macam like
and is it okay but I think it's really like macam commendable lah that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but macam
wait kejap dia interested ke dia macam intrigued
it's just like macam thinking about it
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar
masa tu like my god is sixteen
so it's like so meluat
when I jumpa that my malaysian friend I was like duh
as in I didn't say it macam explicitly but I was like dia baru keluar dari sandiwara ke apa
macam the perangai and cara dia cakap and cara dia like um carry himself is so reminiscent of that I just I was just nice I was like you sound like um I was just trying to be nice
give the full burn satu
mm a'ah yang mana
oh pasal apa eh
oh wow mesti of course and his father is like
oh wow mesti of course
totally wrong ke it's okay it's okay
kat masjid dia orang ah
dia orang ada Q&A session ke apa
wow habis no one was able macam curious cat version
macam he's trying lah
did they show the questions yang she wrote
it's not like macam lame questions kan like those questioning the fundamentals eh
ya lah pasal hari-hari orang just setakat tanya um
ah is smoking haram
macam dah stop it sia like
okay for her everywhere and jalan
okay so orang ni tanya soalan and then they
so dia dia received the question so ustaz tu received the question lepas tu dia dia just simpan dia tak address on the spot
it's true lah I guess it's macam it's getting better these days like definitely but macam
ya ya like kat rumah ya
sekejap eh dia actress dia pakai tudung
macam macam like if it does not add to the plot right kenapa nak bagi sangat orang tu
so kacau macam kau nak tidur lepas tu dengan pin pin dia semua
oh macam uh yang instant ah
I see like unless dia orang nak cakap orang-orang malaysia semua like sleep with tudung like that lah
step like I was going to say step alim but is that rude
bodoh kan
orh macam
macam tak ada ke tak ada ke model lain eh kata shampoo eh
atau macam at least just maybe like say macam the fragrance is nice or something and then like
aku tak tahu ah actually I feel like
aku tak tahu mana nak makan sia these days I feel like
oh aku nak cakap dengan kau just now okay so like since last week ah
I aku everyday datang balik sekolah to like do do my work
I started off early then at first the all all my paintings look good at first then tiba-tiba aku just macam
aku keep telling myself that aku ada banyak masa
then end up like push push everything until macam friday which is the set up day ya then aku last minute rush abeh like
dia dia macam confident gila lah that then she she was proud of her work
then uh all this while she okay lah I can see her effort ah that she did she did put in a lot of effort tapi dia punya dia punya
then dia berbual pasal hijab
then I I like I genuinely thought she would get good grades lah tapi tadi time assessment dia kena buat rabak gila ya
then err because err my work is painting paste dengan aku add four D element which is projector lah then err mm aku aku end up being the last because
I had to set up my mini projector then it's energy saving what so kirakan aku aku end up from register number five to aku jadi last
ya then aku nervous gila ah because like everybody like already presented then you know how like if you go first you cannot be compared with anybody then your if you are the last they see everyone's one even the good ones the bad ones they see everything already ya
ya then turns out they they they really like my work ya tapi like aku aku like just macam like because I felt like I didn't really do well you know
so dia dia leave lah in the middle of the
the presentation then err mm cause my artwork aku berbual pasal family then I don't know if it's because it's a very sensitive topic that's why dia orang macam tak berbual sangat pasal aku punya but then but then again right I had another classmate who like
err dia berbual pasal family then dia kena rabak script
lagi pun dia tak ada dia tak ada script
ya dia just berbual kan then she fumbled over her words ya ya
tiga because satu dapat err I don't know why but
err from the start dia cakap dia ada dengue
dia kena dengue then
ya then then he obviously had to stay home lah but it's been like since august sampai sekarang
ya I think he was hospitalized for like a while ni sampai ni dari august tau
ya tapi okay ah class lecturers ya satu presentation jer
but module sama oh what
ya tapi dia orang semua baik ah but
tapi sama sem
kita asyik tukar class
ya then last semester we were doing something else like we we experiment with like two D three D four D ya kau punya is kau terus masuk kau punya ya

ya this time round kau ambil berapa eh oh ya aku kena six sia six credits ya then the the the packaging one was actually four credits and
tapi aku tak nak because it's like four hour class lama gila
asal kau tak ambil yang performing tu sia macam interesting jer
oh jadi macam tak match mismatch gitu lah
next semester kau ada professional development uh so like that course so it helps you like helps you like uh macam choose what ya then at the end of the semester tak salah aku we will have an artist speech
ya then artist speech kan you have to like really go all out for that one minute one minute jer tau kau boleh berbual and then they will invite artist to come then like on the spot if they like you they will hire you ya but I don't think I will get it that's the thing because because class aku ada banyak orang yang stand out
what ours because ours kan you can choose wherever you want to work then like one of my seniors also he he he wants to be a tattoo artist sekarang dia kerja kat tattoo studio ah
uh ya year three sem one but by the time by the time next year kau kena dah ada kerja pe

really really like like gila babi sia
entah eh macam banyak gila like like everywhere
rabak rabak dok mahal gila sekarang like dulu eh dulu time kita potong rambut eh
aku rasa seven eight dollars ah or even lesser ah five dollars ah maybe sekarang basic haircut jer dah at least dua puluh like twenty dollars like walao eh jialat heavy
basic lor for me I look at it like very basic orh like entah simple ah potong jer ah biasa jer ah
ya ah I mean if like the normal normal people lah like you know like the neighbourhood people all confirm scared one lah sia like last like you know you go to pakcik-pakcik place last time like very welcome you know pakcik-pakcik like more
lepak then they talk about mat rock mat rock all music all
I cut at home I got shaver right then I alamak how to cut ah ah one time ah one time ah one time ah botak ah botak ah botak simple ah I mean tak keluar pun duduk rumah lepak rumah jer lek-lek ah
um most of the time entah eh lepak makan err
exercise chey step badan badan step abang body ah step ah it's don't know like really exercise ah bo pian leh like
I tell you stay at home you confirm fall sick one ah rabak gila sia
every night I think we we we did like macam apa
covered thirty days thirty days sial wah gila babi sia thirty days
gila thirty days
so you see them from a virtual screen macam everyone dalam kotak-kotak sendiri so pelik ah but
ya ya pity them ah that one rabak ah or people who are you know alone lonely ah nobody to talk to ah wah
stop lah not say stop lah like there's still a lot of restriction ah I know there's a at least we still can now can at least go out meet people or you just be out alone you know just lepak lepak or what but of course keep a safe distance lah
ah then at least people you know it's good to be outside ah like you stuck at home wah mati sia mati mati mati confirm mati one but but but good lah we can go out
ya I heard ah rabak eh rabak sia like that one hour or maybe they have a few few hours only to go out then very strict wah rabak rabak but rabak one is in india ah wah the police rembat sia the police wah that one that one really rabak ah the police rembat the people who go out but then you know it's not supposed to be that way lah but then what to do they have to be very strict right but hopefully it's not going on now lah
entah semua busy semua macam
busy ah biasa lah family people
wan G also work busy he also dia baru cakap sikit hari rabak sia kerja macam recently start rabak ah after public holiday macam err apa kerja daripada pagi dia start pukul sepuluh habis pukul satu pagi that kind
ah kat rumah orh
work from home orh ah rabak gila like rabak gila
but tak tahu ah but dia dapat keluar weekends ah but I think weekends also he go out also spend time with wife orh like what else he can do right
tak tak isyad pun ada cakap juga the part wan G wan G turun sekejap ah but entah I think they got family event ah ke apa entah tak tahu ah but tak kesah ah at least they go out ah
lama gila dok
aku rasa the last kita jam before circuit breaker atau
kita tak jam terus lepas balik yang vietnam punya show lama lama gila lama gila babi
like semua semua put on hold lah okay lah but at least other bands macam ada jam ah like space ya quite active lah like no cause we also we we also
like take some time off just to do the mixing lah but I think cause that time we prioritise on that first lah cause dah lama gila seh like hold back kita punya recording
entah tengok ah tapi dah habis ah dah habis mix dah habis finally habis ah like dah swee ah tinggal hantar mastering then lepas tu
tak tahu we still finding for for people lor um
tak ah err overseas ah
tak tahu dorang boleh dapat sound dia ke tak
kalau haji hussin boleh
err oh tu dia punya mixing mastering suite eh
tak nanti nanti aku berbual dengan dorang ah try to talk to them we also finding ah we will be sitting down
I don't know ah that's the plan ah I follow only cause I think the the whole idea of song by song is like at least you know scared like kita release macam all one shot kan nanti macam people get bored easily ah like ah so kita punya style gitu ah I mean is four songs only apa it's not it's not like a whole album lah if whole album then
what what's the whole concept ah you know what I mean the whole concept of the is macam is all err is is interconnected ah is like err is like err macam a story ah from song number one to song number four
ah yes concept album so semua macam interconnected ah there's a story to it ah
so kita plan macam release song by song right then every song ada different artwork
budget ah see what kind of concept lah then also must pay for mastering err then we use up some money also for for our recording and all so but then we'll see ah we'll see how it goes ah pelan-pelan ah pelan-pelan kayuh ah
tapi dia still macam part of it pe part of us dia tak keluar like know tak keluar in a bad terms dia keluar in a good term
and then you know he he was also part of the whole recording journey in the beginning pe ya so then tak kesah ah then we will we'll see how ah kita nanti duduk berbual we discuss with everyone see if they okay with it
entah tengah rabak juga ah
pasal dia was working dekat mana eh
dia was working dekat
then lepas tu err circuit breaker dia kena laid off just like that
baru masuk orh baru masuk like I think one month plus two months ah
then kena laid off so dia struggle ah but I think he's doing graphic design and also food delivery ah but okay eh the food delivery actually actually cannot help cannot help ah
so not bad ah I mean simple don't want to make it over very overly mix if not like rabak sia like like overly produced
duh rabak rabak rabak rabak rabak that one rabak but okay lah we see lah
tu lah
tapi aku rasa kalau touring kan confirm tak so soon punya confirm lama lagi seh
aku tahu aku tahu aku tahu pasal siti nak kahwin
tu ah abeh macam mana kacau mesti kacau punya abeh macam mana orang nak kahwin
tapi kau dah set seh
aku rasa dia masih cakap the the only girl in the family
tapi depends ah individual pe tapi tak tahu ah tak tahu tak tahu apa pasal lah eh but maybe sekarang memang period dia nak tak tahu aku tak tahu maybe dorang buat grand ke tapi
ya but entah lah eh
I think he doesn't show ah he doesn't show that he needs to struggle lah but but before that dia he was okay what when he he haven't got he was going to get married I I
oh ya lah beli rumah cause rumah expensive but then got pe
ya aku tak tahu tapi
but then again both kerja full-time pe full-time should be able to sustain apa macam kalau you say you like freelancer okay ah of course ah that one jialat but but full-time confirm every month you will get
tapi pun depends ah if how big of a house you want to buy ah I mean if you technically if you one time you want to buy one big house of course it's quite expensive lah but if you start small anyway houses you can sell what you know some people will start small buy three room first ah
if not ah if us ah walao confirm confirm huru-hara one macam apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni
nanti aku depressed dengan duit orang dengan aku sendiri stress seh eh macam mana ni
tapi tu rabak juga sia kalau dia cabut
tapi estee power ah estee pandai manage ah
but entah lah
tapi okay lah band band aku missy shoot pun
missy shoot pun nak record lah so tapi kita take it easy pasal sekarang I mean hakim is busy with work rabak gila aku macam dah beberapa minggu sia tak jumpa dia ajak lepak tak jumpa ajak lepak tak jumpa
dia jam dekat sini tapi dia actually tak reply message
bila dorang book
dia tengah busy
dia so dorang tak ada dia dorang message dia tengah busy dia tak dia tak dia tak dia tak reply pasal tengah busy kan so dia belum cakap dia okay ke tak then suddenly they book
they book already ah dorang dah book huh serious ah dorang dah book semalam aku tak reply sia
then dia turun ah tu pasal aku rasa dia lambat cause dia kena settle family benda punya pe I mean he work also busy already then he needs to spend time with family so bo pian ah
ya tapi okay lah but missy shoot pasal kita selalu jam also on weekdays jadi dia pun tengah busy tapi kita tengok lah but definitely the plan is to record at least by
hujung tahun ni ah
tak tahu ah
I think sial is very influential macam banyak influence err orang-orang probably also cause of
dia female fronted
abeh and then nyanyi malay lagu melayu
then very very strong musical apa
bagus juga rare juga nampak band macam gitu like playing macam
betul aku realise that juga
I mean aku ikut korang yang time europe tour aku realise actually aku get to see many things
but then again I think the twenty four hours pun macam can feel the vibe lah pasal you are still macam dekat another country orh then you see like even though macam say for example eh for example kau main germany ah but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different ah
so at least you get to see that culture know macam berlin really very
power and hipster hipster-ish very ni and then you go to another part of germany is like very more rundown ghetto sucky very kampung like in kampung ah but then
macam save cost ah kau tak payah spend duit on macam err apa lodging dorang will kasi kau crash tempat dorang I mean that's the give and take ah you know
I mean I think dia maybe that his style ah if he don't like that culture or not say culture ah he don't like the vibe of the place I think he don't want to go lah
ah same same as long as I get out of here like singapore for at least that whole stretch two weeks ah two weeks pun dah cukup
cause kalau tak rabak sia kau
cause aku realise siti is is quite an adventurous person looking at her travel photos like when she posts on her social apa instagram
she can travel alone dia boleh travel alone pergi macam
ah tu pasal ah
gila cause aku realise cause bila that time kita dekat london tu then dia willing to go jalan-jalan sorang dia pandai explore seh like like she knows her way ah like to to just explore ah dia tak takut she got she's fearless ah but I think
that something yang holding her back ah
ya but tak tahu ah
aku pun nak tour lah dengan macam urgent matter I mean missy shoot lain sikit lah pasal kalau nak tour
probably lagi susah lah pasal lal pun macam iman's league right and then it's very
it'll be hard lah I mean cause missy shoot broke up for quite a while then I think the focus for him was iman's league ah then he came back so but I think he he still very on lah he wrote songs for missy shoot like even like you know when he do chords then he will ask eh does this ni kena tak
then macam tak ah ni tak kena ah ni very very iman's league ah okay tak apa then dia akan tukar to change to kita punya vibe
selalunya is dol or most of the time is dol lah
he he he did give some ideas err when we take in some ideas some ideas macam tak kena lah pasal it's not our vibes but he tries to control not to go into macam very rubik's vibes
you know ah dia macam
err but he will try to control he he don't want to macam dia tak nak tukar the sounds
ah bad religion I mean influence ah cause we influence with bad religion abeh macam influence with rise against dol punya influence is heavily rise against
heavy lal is very melodic guy lal suka melody so he
japanese punk like cause he grow up with macam he grow up with a lot of ska music and then japanese ska japanese punk rock he he he dia banyak macam on that vibe but aku is more very bad religion penny wise ah
ah propagandhi err that fast and know a lot of yes so that that vibe so at least it's but bagusnya everything is jumble up you see so semua dah jumble up semua dah macam
biasa ah
but entah eh
dia macam very err straight kan
tapi dorang tak tahu ah zul dah tak cakap dengan ni ah dengan bob ah eh practise ah single pedal aku feel playing single pedal
yang buat dia very unique ah dia macam unique gila ah but then ah to each its own ah style ah ya but see ah see ah I don't know ah we still got a
betul dorang dah boring ah
bad religion still stick to that sound but then ada modern element I feel ah that's how I feel
he got a vibe ah a different vibe I still like bad religion ah cause dorang
cause they very abang abang
I don't know ah he some pop punkers like feeling feeling tapi macam
entah very kental ah I cannot this pop punk pop punk thing ah
tapi tengah set ah
then will send us then cakap okay err ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit
err then he will adjust okay okay let's meet then bila time jumpa baru like minor tweaking and tweak as much as possible
then dah lah see how pasal kita record with no clicks then very simple err
miking macam drums only four mikes err so that's why some sound macam really tak boleh dapat and stuff lah but we this is like a trial ah for me lah it's a trial ah but then nanti tengok ah like in future future recording kita do it like better ah
cause hakim macam dah offer eh next recording aku aku will make sure like all the all the miking will be better lah
ya lah that's why dia dia discovered tu pasal that time actually dia offered to macam eh macam kau nak rerecord balik kau punya drum but then
ah but then aku cakap eh tak ada click orh we don't play with click so it's gonna be susah sia like okay lah we try ah I did record like what um we tried half a song ah but it's difficult cause there's no click
tak feel ah like tak feel ah so then I think then I told him next time ah like the next time we we we try to record
cause he discover but good thing that but good ah he's very hardworking dia discover sounds so he he knows more stuff so next time round he can give more input lah but then again it's not a bad recording ah this time
correct but then have to be patient ah but then but then again for example this spacedays punya
spacedays punya vibe is because we we needed to
big one the big one tall one ah bass man fender bass man I think he bought for like what seven hundred plus then he he refurbish balik err for like four hundred plus so he actually spent like thousand plus on that cheap
dia rajin gila ah ya but good lah know he he he he invests on that lah he invests on that then to have like
then apa tu force vomit pun tengah record
ah then recently dia cakap last week eh last week dia cakap dia record dikir barat
don't know I think cause he knows some guys you know he he also got this ranggi ranggi guys ah ranggi is the motorcycle macam
ah so ranggi is actually macam um
ranggi is err some of them ada budak-budak dikir barat ah
so I think dorang
abeh hakim is a buat sounds pe
so dia macam pergi dekat dia lah but then banyak lah then it's like side bazaar bush man dia punya side project
adib I think adib playing bass err then got err um restam bushman main guitar then err rizal rizal dulu main sound of province rizal main sound of province dulu
rizal kecil
he covered ah session I think for sound province but he's a good drummer lah then dia main for this band aku tak tahu siapa lagi a few more guys ah like play for his band
so dorang macam rerecord balik ah ya
um but then financially maybe tak sangat lah
tu lah
tu pasal lah tak aku cakap dengan zad juga zad dia tahu macam dia tak ada benda abeh then tiba-tiba macam korang main semua cakap zad kau nak pakai pakai ah kau nak pakai pakai ah eh tak boleh ah kau mahal sangat macam tak kesah ah pakai jer it's a wear and tear thing
aku tahu dia mahal but then I'm giving you that that green light apa that green light to just go and use instead of
but okay ah understand sometimes people don't want to terhutang budi kau tahu
tak maybe maybe also from experience
like we don't know like maybe dulu dia pernah macam have this friend who like okay just use ah then after that after using already then like eh wah now I want to you never give me back macam you know
jialat ah jialat got friend ah but then tak tahu ah but I'm okay ah kalau zad nak pinjam
dah ah
tapi end of the day also all the stuff macam like it's a wear and tear punya benda pe so
tak boleh cakap kalau kau pakai tak pecah esok aku pakai pecah eh you also broken what it'll also break what like know like so it's okay lah I mean the thing is
ya that's why kesian sia I know he's been macam dia berbual dengan aku ah like cannot wait sia I cannot wait to play drums sia
ah I cannot wait to lepak I cannot wait to record you know I told him lah if you need to record a band say for example band want to record you just record then call some of us lah we can help you set up the mic setting ah
like I know he don't want to terhutang budi that's confirm and maybe his style is different dia takut macam dia
maybe he accidentally say for example we set the mic he scared he accidentally scold eh macam don't like that then he scared people like heart hurt what hurt the feeling hurt what so I don't think he's like that
but kita dah cakap ah I mean I already told him also eh kalau kau need to record you need help you just call us lah ah we will we will not ask for anything we will just help you ah cause you is is is you are the one doing the work
we here just to help lepak
sekarang mesti dia rabak gila seh dekat rumah tapi tengok ah
no but the thing is this type of thing right the walk right you cannot pikiran you know just go regret lepas tu ah regret after that ah but there's no regret ah I mean for me personally when I went err the walk was was rabak ah the starting was fun cause everything but
no but she also was struggling ah cause the last I think there was like four hundred metres we already saw the the entrance for coney island right that last four hundred metres suddenly like eh guys guys sekejap sekejap sekejap stop stop stop aku tak boleh aku tak boleh ah so we actually sat down and azil macam okay no problem no problem duduk
then it was like matahari dekat mata the sun was already like in the eyes ya
ya eight o'clock then kita macam eh kita rest like it was only like still it was also four hundred metres five hundred metres more can see already it's like the bridge was just in front of us then we took out our shoes then we lek sekejap lek sekejap
rabak ah for me ah personally but I told them sorry ah I say paiseh paiseh ah like we have to have a lot of stops
so you you still go but we take it slow never mind don't care about the time but as long as we reach there we settle ah ah so we did manage to finish ah so the moment we touch that thing right kita cakap kita sampai right
macam macam azil we made it ah we just high five sia
eh take photo take photo take photo lepas tu kita pergi tepi pengsan I lie down already sia I lie down already I don't care already take out shoes take out socks azil take out socks take out shoes aisyah also sit down then all termenung already like good twenty minutes
eh hafiz fetching ah jalan to the punggol settlement there is like another one click ah
one point five click ah betul
rabak ah
I I almost got into like hallucination already cause it's tiring already ah like oh dah penat ah dah penat ah dah penat ah mata dah rabak I cannot think properly then like want to smoke also malas you know like want to minum air just drink water ah drink water drink water drink water drink water
they even reach they want to eat also lazy you know so the moment we reach right actually hamimah zafran all they wake already they wanted to go makan
ya lah breakfast but cause aisyah ah hafiz fetching aisyah mah so they wanted to go makan then they ask you and nazril kau dengan nazril plan ah nak pergi makan mana then kita jumpa somewhere tu aku cakap eh tak boleh ah
kita nak balik tidur balik tidur ah nak balik tidur
so hafiz fetch us fetch actually wanted to fetch fetch aisyah then we wanted to grab home then hafiz cakap eh tak apa ah aku hantar korang ah
dia cakap semua orang dia dah rabak aku pergi cari toilet aku jalan balik dorang dah ketawa ketawa pasal aku dah slow gila then aku duduk aku duduk macam eh sia ah to go into the car also macam eh sia ah rabak sia ni
ah apa oh ya ya cause coastal
twenty one eh like like almost twenty clicks ah actually almost twenty clicks ya include east coast one way err hud told me is about twenty five clicks ye
tak but I think this time if we go right we we go that route but we
that sengkang we thought you is after that bridge thought the sengkang is already punggol sekali eh bukan it's another sengkang
but then the coney island right is if you go straight the park connector dia macam sampai dekat red bridge tau but this one is before red bridge kau dah belok kiri
they confirmed busy ah gitu kan kirakan
but wah like that macam
ni oh so ni technically actually not everybody boleh dapat ah
oh damn so apa ni when when did this thing came out again
mana tahu I mean like maybe they could be busy atau you know
tak nak waste time lah
penat ah stress gila
it's like different league ah kirakan different league
three metres cause tahu lah heavy breathing
for real for real dia macam if
yes true but you must still keep your safe distancing measure especially kalau if kau heavy breathing three metre jer
lagi jauh sia might as well tak yah main sports
okay ah takpe maybe kau pergi dulu ah then you give me a rough idea ah
ah ya takpe ah
macam standard ah cakap english ah okay okay not bad
tukar question eh sempat sia tukar okay takpe
my dreams okay tak yah let it go into specifics ah but like my dreams would require to sacrifice most of my leisure time yes that's a brief description
aha that one is uh takpe lah
aku would want to be invisible
eh bocui sia nah tak payah tak payah we don't snitch
but what about kau
eh by the way kau watch uh umbrella academy
aku rasa they talking about like
kau tahu like
but it's like a natural thing ah for kau kan and some it's honestly called talent ah to be that smart at that young age
yes correct ah betul
so in a way pun kau like grateful lah for what has happened because it made you too because
a'ah overrated pun
aku still wouldn't hear it lah to be honest cause
but also don't need say ah cause kitanya radio our campus radio pun overplayed their songs ah
if kau realise
eh I wanted to join eh come on lah aku nak join sia
aku feel like okay this will definitely make sense but
then they will need to be make more and make more then the space especially kat Singapore kan kitanya country small
oh mak yes
low-key kalau ada ah eh
but kau imagine though
confirm yes correct betul betul aku agree
work is a an activity apa
ah we can call it a food lah that I know you won't be jelak of is sweets lah
because normal lah everytime aku nampak kau selalu makan gula selalu makan gula ada benda ah kat dalam mulut kau selalu
K kau rindu sekolah sangat ke huh
standard confirm oh yang that sebelah drink store that western the burger
betul lah betul lah cause before you eat with your mouth you eat with your eyes ah they say
but here's another thing though aku nak kena tanya kau
takde no such thing
dia kau dah check up
awal pe
ya I know aku dari tadi nampak ah so that's why but it's okay understandable
so kau boleh cakap dengan diri kau macam
takde I cannot
just a little bit just a little bit eh perang ah just a little bit jer
head ah kirakan head of department
but I mean actually not that bad especially yang that time ah
aku dengan cyprus kena caught kena kat toilet
err suruh jumpa miss tan mister adrian and that time mister adrian was a ah
then dia cakap dengan aku pasal all these actions
then dia cakap dengan aku oh your punishment is going to be you have to go to
no thank god he he just he just then I'm like eh serious ah aku stress sia twenty twenty class what the fuck
mmhmm eh macam tahu jer not bad macam tahu jer
ah a'ah sia lagi lagi NITEC let's be honest ah NITEC has more girls that higher NITEC that's a fact
ah sorry ada orang ada girlfriend takpe takpe takpe
I mean in a way kau boleh train kan that shit too
oh like macam straight away not bad
not only macam pasal discount price and shit cause
ah apa lagi soalan kau tengah tengok ni
dia ada berapa soalan sia
yeah that few is berapa lah
aku definitely heard of the word
apa ah
macam detective ah aku ingat aku ingat
but honestly ah aku like just like that ah the aircon on the bus
sekarang most to most yang buat joke is
aku lah
ah susah sia
okay ah but I understand uh pun kau have your own things going and you know I wish you well and shit lah
no the best time was when we were year one kat J seven
uh kau setakat kat belakang I don't know why you looking at fish hooks and okay lah that guy interested
ah ah aku masih ingat
but if I had known earlier that kau akan like you know quit soon
I mean aku understand lah aku understand
oh merepek
ah yes oh my god kau
that's why aku agree ah with kau on that
you are better off now kau tengah buat what kau love honestly we still keep in contact so that's also good lah
kau wait ah kau tunggu aku I think I got told you this before bila aku ada motor aku datang situ kalau tak kita lek lek jap
uh tak aku kalau lagi four more
tapi takpe kau tunggu jer
ah boleh boleh enjoy that's that's my main goal lah to be honest lah eh
ah fifteen minutes twenty fifteen minutes boleh ah fifteen minutes
if aku
aku not sure sia
do kau have something in mind I'm really not sure sia
especially kau dengar Converse seven to ten august that time
tak tahu tadi terhang sikit ah eh
I'd say looks ah cause honestly body you can do anytime but if your looks rabak kan and your face ah that's it got nothing to do already just give up unless
body can do anytime makan makan makan
how about kau
wah bagus bagus abeh honest eh
it's just aku rasa mainly cause of apa body type is it that kind of thing
ah yes I mean at that point of time pun kan so like kau just need more experience a little bit more experience that's all
kau tengah cakap pasal which food court ada
yes is it that one yang kau tengah cakap that food court
dorang taruk those uh what do they call that
like feed properly the chicken that kind of thing kan bukan macam give them some
air and
kau punya melayu hancur sia apa yang oksigen apa sia
I aku tak pernah sia cakap like oksigen like
ever in malay maybe that's why aku tak tahu ah this is my honestly my first time hearing it
exactly and the fact that macam mana eh all those dormitory workers
but it's just sad that they have to live inside there until aku tak tahu bila
actually that's what they should do sia after like phase two pasal kita semua quarantine kat rumah kan and shit
then you slowly move to phase two which is yang kau cakap implement tu and then slowly gradually macam sekarang ah
tapi sekarang tak lepas phase two jer semua orang keluar
but you know the problem now is also pasal
older generations them and their phone tak payah cakap ah
aku pernah experience like customers old auntie lah
kau pun heard ah the reason they
pun is just cause the economy is dropping that's all
oh ya ya aku nampak
at least also like go out with a purpose are ada orang just keluar setakat untuk lepak
ah yes okay ya betul betul betul
kau nampak national day
as in like tak yah cakap ah
like a lot of people then aku nampak like a tweet on Twitter that says like
because nobody is following the safety measure rules whatsoever one metre apart takde jer semua lama just one big ass
ah takpe lah president
eh but area kau ada fireworks
but like you know romantics sikit who knows bring you to bali
I would like settle down if one country if one country aku boleh settle down kan aku would settle down at
have you seen the mountains there just online aku macam
but if kau nak peace you know do your work alone enjoy retirement shit
that place untuk aku is perfect ah
K the other side aku dengar it's like something about
aku nak quit sia aduh
but ni macam last minute ah aku didn't know that err our school provided a bursary
cause aku didn't know until miss tan text aku like
ya I think so but then aku fikir balik eh bukan aku dah nak graduate april oh sekarang jer baru dia nak bagi
oh nenek eh kau tinggal sorang kan dalam
asal room kau gelap sia kau tak
oh takde apa
subuh so technically kau should
aku nya time eh
so my school starts actually for now it's like um tengah holiday semester one holiday then semester two starts like
october nineteen tu pun now is just only like semester one jer belum semester two then like it's still like year one so
macam I feel like year one ni lama gila
ya my friends also like nak ajak hang out also my friend you know sarah
she ada club so she sarah and nasrul ni uh both of them is club is school of applied science punya
ah is more like your own course habis is more of like leadership punya kind of
then um tak salah
sarah have like err apa ni event ah for their um for their so she's the one that like macam like overall in charge
so ada ada um ada ada groups yang kena buat event tu one is her group kena pilih another one is another group tapi nashrul punya group like um tak kena chosen and after like she's very busy with her club
until I don't know I think until next two week then after that next two week baru like we
I also have my own tapi tak apa lagi pasal malas
ya pasal malas
honestly I respect those people yang macam dia orang sudah like for two years
and then doing the same thing that budak poly buat then having to go through the same thing like for another three years kat poly it's just so tiring and exhausting ah that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people yang
selepas they choose to just work
apa ni uh studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
poly kan macam also is like poly so like I feel like macam ni poly example I take it as eh having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
it's not like macam easy you know like for those people who really like um
buat the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
salute those people who macam have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to um poly ya
phase is just um submitting your diploma ranking course lah kalau your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah kan dia dapat interview so dia pass interview and then she already get her what ah her results that like she can go in like like her place for
um pharmaceutical science memang sudah chop chop for her so macam okay lah she sudah selamat she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because dia memang can already it's like
so macam kalau interview sudah pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all lah
but for me because my interview tak dapat
now focus solely on which is uh kita orang pasal kita orang tak ada exam also so they look
over um they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day macam for us kan ada orang like
um sekolah dia orang satu hari is like is combination of subjects but for me is like kalau math is
then after that kalau there's a mixture of A and B is banyak and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like um three to four
gitu then kalau macam C banyak gitu then maybe around two point five to three point five gitu then um
like baru berapa compared to my other two friend I think they did more better lah in a sense
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech memang nak try dapat biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan dia like
dia like mati-mati nak biomedical science jer like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
but the thing he tak put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense lah cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
biology also tak pernah dapat A
A susah nak dapat then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard lah cause it's the um they focus um on biology the most
so like this semester tak ada exam so I next semester ada exam
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay pasal assignment dia pun is
tak banyak like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day kan like through read virtually like other then after that um
habis ada quiz juga that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
then the practice question is like biasa macam homework gitu
mostly banyak presentation but it's good lah
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm um when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages pasal like I think you will feel like
kalau I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu kan is just like my weakness like
then pasal presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then macam
senang lah but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates yang
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation punya tu
sometimes I'm like wow kita dah eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near um uniforms so macam eh how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old lah then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage kan aku macam actually it's normal macam biasa like wow it's just normal lah honestly
and it's okay cause macam tak ada boyfriend kan it's okay lah macam we don't really take that into my mind macam oh like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like keluar dates with you know I think
I don't really mind lah kalau I have a boyfriend or not as long as macam that is like um kawan dekat you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me pasal later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
NAFA is like lah kirakan
like different people also like different lah honestly like um the things that they're prioritising and it's all like semua ada masing-masing lah hanya
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to macam have a lot of worries like oh pasal duit and all that of course you want your family to be macam stable lah like in every um ya in everything you know
it's very hard lah like I feel like kalau family tak cannot like tak tak ada like stability and all that kan I feel like ah one day confirm will fall apart punya
and some more I also like the type of person yang tak message orang
like wow kalau dah malas dia punya malas is malas tak aku boleh like
for one week straight tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa cause like I'm that type of person ah
so macam ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up kan macam wah like heartbreak this heartbreak gila babi you know like that kind
but then like wah like sekarang I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
but even though like there are times macam eh macam nak ada orang like to be by your side like a boyfriend lah okay kirakan like cakap good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
kita boleh get over it lah there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
so like sometimes kalau oh ada family gathering kan it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something ah even my sister like
like uh video call her friends during ah apa ni I'm having a dinner so I I feel like macam like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay lah kalau ada kawan tu okay but then like kalau it's time to like for your family you focus on your family jer tak mahu get mixed lah like video call with friends like
other time you can do what like kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang like jumpa kawan habis kat rumah also like kawan then like when are you going to like you know um
mm spend time with your family not really ya tak ada
wow I'm lucky to be in such a family kind punya vibes cause different family different ah ada family like focus um
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future kalau nak ada family I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then kalau like my anak-anak macam ada boyfriend ke girlfriend ke aku macam nak bagi advice sikit
I got here lah so I mean initially we plan to meet pukul dua belas gitu but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay lah I want to naik basikal then now I'm regretting it lah
hot pun it's not tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah like the past few days it's not really that got lah but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place tak tak jauh sangat it's eleven kilometers
and the weather cuaca pun okay juga lah so I mean it's okay you got lah so I mean it's
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law tapi dia cakap difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling tak payah pakai mask pe
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask yang kena and the one the government kasih atau the one that they government suruh lah
I just use the kain like the one the the they call it the kain untuk muka
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent ah barang-barang kena muka like some debris you just go to uh face what's that at least apa dia ada protection because if not like
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is tempat kosong so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre lah maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to cepat juga lah but then
then some more ada construction tempat construction so
so the tempat construction is just debris ah then the habuk-habuk masuk hidung then I was like my nose a bit itchy lah then I mean
okay ah then ya so that that was the time yang cause that one tempat dekat dengan forest forest sana because it's the ulu ulu tempat ulu sana so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya lah err lalat masuk lah hidung
eh lalat masuk mulut
I mean literally it's not at house anymore lah dia dah dekat luar lah
eh ya dia masuk lah I mean
you are cycling penat-penat jauh it's like you are jauh then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna pakai mulut eh pakai your hidung ya it's kena use your pakai mulut lah you
then by chance the thing masuk and nasib tak masuk my the the air pipes it masuk my esophagus straightaway so I just telan
dia makan betul ah I also tak berak-berak so okay ah
sakit no ah it just
I think it's just extra protein ah I don't know apa dia makan kat that ulu area and I mean forest I mean housefly they flies are basically came from maggots what then then they evolve
so I don't know maybe there's something they rotten there then I'm just extra protein lah abeh some people confirm makan maggot what good
you want nak makan bat
currently I'm taking kat the the ubi sana lah I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing ah like naik basikal if you exercise you go distance and if you work pakai kerja deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also lah like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license lah bike license boleh tolong apa like like two in one so just settle everything
aku pun tak tahu but I I think depends lah I think now the the rate dia dah really drop dah jatuh so
cause I think now there's a influx dah banyak I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now kerja ah apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a ada grabfood dengan foodpanda eh apa deliveroo account ah I don't really need dapat masuk joined foodpanda lah so I think
I those two is enough ah and then now also masih because I'm now masih like recently kena diagnosed dengan hyperthyroidism so my saya I just sakit sangat lah I just susah nak nak exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down ah just do less
I don't remember calling it docket uh I think the maybe dia orang it's a foodpanda punya benda ah pasal for apa grabfood dengan deliveroo they call it ah incentive so dapat incentive like you deliver ten ah
thirty forty dollars that was itu pun only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one kerja lah the orang lain semua kerja kerja so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
competing competing orang-orang lain semua ah so
that is grabfood lah for for deliveroo incentive punya ada every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
like you in a in a pickle you just call jer nanti they just will assist you ah tolong just tolong you like just like that grabfood you call sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat
oh ya ya depends lah kalau dia orang nak kasih tip dia orang nak kasih tip ah I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself tak ada tip culture what it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip nanti dia orang fikir eh ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
ya they give ten dollar I tip just kasih ah
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app atau the cash so they will just give you cash ah like from singapore's tipping
food their tipping like their the the person the company they ambil duit the the that it was supposed to tip but to you so it's like
rabak ah but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip ah so that's what the company the company
well I mean because tak ada duit selalu no pocket no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment pakai dia punya that account lah so ya so my biggest is paling banyak is ten dollar ah lah but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar lah itu dapat terus sepuluh dollar just just the just deliver and it was a tempat pun like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically tempat dia is like depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan then he just like maybe
fifty meter and lima puluh meter jer I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar dia orang kasih then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter pergi angkat itu jer
been a long time ago lah like dah lama juga ah I've gained back the empat ratus tu so
like four empat about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories ah barang like
it's err I mean you want to do something you on the road ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun it's you what
the thing is sometime pun orang like you rider you will sometimes take naik basikal you I mean then you anything happen like then eh guai lan padahal sometimes you forget eh your your means your safety first lah you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you lupa about yourself lah so it's quite stupid ah sometimes like you
we are paid by duit apa by by by time so the time you cepat you get more money so kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu green green light belum green light tu showing but you want nak to go you want to go
ya lah so safety also have to come first ah because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk lah but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian jalan jalan lah so like senang
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I since I can go two in one go to the road and pergi the pedestrian pathway tapi
kadang-kadang pun singapore drivers
memang semacam ah
err talking about check back blind spot tadi on the way here already I was I was really know I was
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on um from the main road going straight so dia dari the the the other side nak masuk the main road from the zebra crossing ah the junction so the
the driver dia tak nampak ah I like I was really prepared to break from jauh but I was already dah macam dah nak
I was really like to be beside her in that main road dia just jam break ah then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like dia not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her ah
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour boleh nampak apa dari jauh then like there was a car like
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't tak ternampak tak nampak so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break ah
so she just she jam break herself ah then just I hear dia cakap sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her lah
oh ya err so sekarang I'm taking my bike license lah like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
I mean it's a good thing for a license lah you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are dari the cyclists ah you are like basically the food chain ah kat bawah sekali
ah tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh
ya like I think then I think the instructor pun cakap you because some people dah dia dah ada three A license of the three class three three license
then they dia orang nak ambil class two B then they then I think they instructor pun cakap ah you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but sekarang nak nak naik motor then now you know orang motor apa yang jadi so just now I was doing practical lah I did revision but then I think what reason siang sangat because
like cepat sangat ah because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
uh prac five is the revision dah I mean it's the internal cost lah but I already cleared that just that I did revision because dah lama tak naik motor
six kat luar
oh you mean keluar from the to the main road ah yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also naik basikal so I can see apa yang or like what's happening ah kata orang too happening sia I also macam takut ah nak nak nak nak keluar that main road just to naik basikal
I because I choose ubi pasal pun like dekat dengan basikal so I think I I mean naik basikal sana okay lah I don't want to naik basikal every time go pevery time go
I mean aku pun don't mind lah kena ride on some something ride on me but
depends lah so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay lah once in a while occasion so like how aku naik naik basikal sini to to here then also I need to go back naik basikal so depends lah but then nak every time nak take lessons no thanks ah
I will just take public but then now pasal nak dekat so I naik basikal to jer lah
dua puluh enam dua puluh enam the practical like depends lah kadang-kadang in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
I mean basikal pun okay for exercise like I mean comes to dapat motor pun okay lah you
like for transportation because now also tengah like belajar pun like easy lah like boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik public abeh public tempat penuh sangat then you cannot sit down terus macam
I don't know lah I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always macam
I I I don't know lah macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik
singapore I rasa lah I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the I mean the buses everything is err I mean reliable just that I don't know why ah
I was I rasa kubur-kubur dan kena you dug up the kubur then underground then hantu dah semua datang
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike kat sana is one sixty
I don't know ah I want to jimat duit pun okay lah but then I want to nak like I mean nak nampak handsome sikit ah so
tak handsome sangat lah
ya like ah muka aku pun buruk sangat so kalau pun tak tak boleh tolong tapi at least kalau at least I from a seven maybe masuk naik atas ke nine ke eight ke all over there ah
you pandai juga eh motor kau
I think when I think kalau nak beli motor pun I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe uh as a second second owner ah not gonna buy until dah nak habis maybe maybe
kalau ada duit of course obviously I will buy ah like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out ah like
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing ah macam like that's because I would be macam jauh away from singapore ya like for enam bulan so I think see how first lah
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing lah ada ada datang balik terus the tyre hilang tinggal handlebar jer kat sana but park kat carpark tinggal handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing lah but
ah I so that's why I need to see first most probably tengok lah most probably I just comeback
then uh I think most probably I will still nak ambil class three three license lah I mean
I mean we err like uh nak buat family cannot be bringing your child kalau ada child naik naik naik motor pe I means still can lah but then like cannot lah like but singapore I mean were asking if want to naik naik bus pe public but then
like when it comes to reliability macam barang-barang selalu breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
aiya I think that one too vague lah like everything can be improve lah semua benda boleh boleh improve pe ada benda merepek pun boleh improve
so tengok lah like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much ah nanti benda problem nanti then you are relying that thing benda rosak then you are
so pandai-pandai ah so that one also cannot rely too much lah
oh ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn ah berbual for I mean this conversation we are having so
which um the surprise yang paling besar yang orang like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
oh so like ah okay okay so duduk lama-lama then suddenly you just don't know either dia orang datang so they put your car then what happen next
so we basically dah kereta you just waiting waiting then dia orang dah sampai tempat pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park lah so then after that dia orang nak bawa to the place to eat lah so and so tempat makan dia at where exactly
okay now let's understand so siapa like you who siapa who was there like siapa kat sana semua like is it your all your soccer mates ah is it just them or ada orang lain celebrating
okay lah I mean ya I mean the also quite gerek lah but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday ah orang like you are with lah people you love orang kalau kawan help your family depends like everyone like ada orang macam nak celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves tak nak orang involved
everybody orang celebrate differently ah so I think it's good lah like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want ah ada some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite dia padahal dia tak nak celebrate they are just nak lepak kat rumah
nak tidur tu jer so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want ah
just kasih duit jer I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff ah I think like ah you give me duit I I can spend myself you give me a voucher kat also I happy dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah
so I think that will be is enough untuk like for me lah tapi
I mean it's good lah you like your friends chip in everything for barang-barang for you
right your your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting lah like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are eh apa like what is happening and like
tengah buat apa ni what they doing sia you are dalam dalam hati is just takut tapi it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say ah duit vouchers are a good thing ah like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just orang just acquaintances you just tanya the mutual friend like eh apa dia suka ah like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to apa
pergi shopping rather you maybe buy a like get err voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also tak shopping banyak sangat
and ya I think the typical barang for guy is orang kasih apa eh kasih those perfume I guess the the they demo apa lagi uh they don't call it perfume dia orang panggil apa eh oh cologne ah cologne but I mean
I don't know lah jangan nak nak step atas cakap perfume sudah lah for me lah okay but
err tapi ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch lah like senang ah unless orang dia macam those uh yang benda benda the all the watches dia dah dah dah ada rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course lah tak payah fikir pasal tu
even grand but then orang orang orang siapa seh ni aku tak berbual then terus it's like
it's like err it's like eh ah like awkward lah you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand lah so so orang kalau fikir okay invite orang lebih lebih padahal you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself tak payah tak payah no need to hide your personality gitu
okay that is I mean birthdays lah but then it's like I mean to me you fikir fikir birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like apa that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person lah dah dah dah tua dah lama or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
okay whatever you said that one orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat like you I mean like birthday birthday ah
tak payah nak mm susah sangat like what you said kalau orang nak book tempat pun as a as an example kalau the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december orang orang confirm like it's gonna be fully book lah so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya lah there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday nak barang-barang semua yang bagus ah like I mean for a celebration lah it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays ah once in a lifetime ah you can you are gonna be that age for once only uh unless err I don't know percaya reincarnation that one different topic lah
okay uh uh ya I guess that's susah ah tapi I think dah nak they by their by their age
jauh lah like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december ah then you have to book very early but then
banyak banyak hotel pun nak book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard lah pasal you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating ah
okay lah ya I mean ya lah I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya lah COVID sekarang buat everything susah even
not even just nak keluar holiday like nak keluar untuk kerja overseas is like the deployment kat overseas is orang semua susah susah is like now everybody kena in singapore like thinking
like they're like whether this apa apa this career dia orang tengah buat is on hold pasal of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point lah not just birthdays ah so like all other like holidays or even like work ah kerja kerja critical this is a it's like a
a good err thing that is I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened lah so like orang can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect ah like in the future is this ah like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead jauh jauh lain ah
I mean the furthest I went paling jauh is U like the I went to that was bila kecil-kecil ah los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember apa yang I did
I mean it helps lah you you got you like you already plan lah nak pergi okay okay I want aku nak pergi jepun so I want to like at least belajar a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
taberu makan like like all those ah keyword like taberu makan and ah coco desuka like ni nak pergi err like go where nak pergi mana go where some something like that lah so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard lah nak cari makan makanan halal but then
I mean yang the big staple food there is you can just I mean minta so I guess ikan sushi nasi and one
I mean hokkaido no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only yokohama that eh no oh no tokyo is lagi tinggi dari yokohama so no that's the highest I've been is to tokyo so but
I think hokkaido tempat tempatnya ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff ah benda-benda cream is usually benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk I mean that that that latitude tinggi-tinggi pun memang understandable lah so ya I mean hokkaido is when it comes to makanan tempat benda sejuk lah dessert
I think it's not also just that lah I mean you also tempat
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also dia orang pun cantik juga I mean their complexion is there tempat pasal there tempat sejuk if it's cold then you don't really sweat much tempat so it depends ah
I mean that's understandable lah you see orang-orang yang mat salleh orang those memang the further north
but the percentage point tak tinggi sangat lah so it's ya lah I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends ah
honestly I think it's a waste of money orang like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just takut eh orang also pergi then I never pergi it's like I cannot talk about it sial berbual abeh then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that dia orang dah pergi so that can talk
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot untuk nak anuh dah just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite merepek ah orang nak belanja then up to them
the other day was just the other day was first time first time aku turun rumah dia then after that aku try kan ah baju dia I mean dia tak pernah nampak cause COVID pe
she was satisfied with it lah which I'm I'm relief lah cause I scared macam
for baju nikah right
apa tu what is what did they call that ah
takde glow that's what I meant takde glow
baju dia right is baju lama

that baju already on the rack since
material the bajunya material is bridal setting right
yang baju dalam baju dalam dia is a dress

kat mana seh
dia macam boot

but dia nya location for the gym is only one place ah area
mid september I so I go home naik taxi right
and then some more my our pay is seventh of the month right so aku submit
aku submit like
and then she say it will be in ah for november pay eh ah october pay lah but I will receive in november apa
so dia pun
peng ah because dia tanya macam how much you got paid ah then after that ah he said oh
dia she just with what just graduated from poly
cause she did events management so in term of macam layan customer and all she's quite good lah like when she draft email actually not bad like no problem in terms of grammar
kesian kan entah macam bila dia datang kerja right sekarang dia datang kerja dia tak dia tak ada semangat ya demoralised I mean
wasted the cert macam tak ada guna
ah suruh dia berbual ah dengan manager cause confirm ada macam review apa dia dah habis dia nya tiga bulan
so macam sometime manager aku tanya macam okay everything okay everything okay
so kalau aku cakap dengan dia ah kalau it bothers her so much
that one point nine is just kau punya
kan aku actually kasi dia scenarios sia like some ya you try lah you try talk like that
kita kalau nak berbual kita tak boleh macam ah cakap pasal macam asal kita tak happy
yes cannot macam involve other people and knowing that they what what's their pay like because surely there is already breach of contract pe and the agreement
dia setakat hire jer
and then she said macam
dia takut ah kalau dia berbual gini
dengan manager aku ke dengan atau dia berbual dengan ke apa or maybe the boss confirm after this dia kena macam pulau
confirm kena pulau kan yes macam eh dia ni budak yang minta minta higher pay
so it's kesian ah
is not conducive at all lah I I I when I see them doing email macam annoying
yes so can you imagine you are doing email abeh you you see customer coming right
but this is not the case that's why when I see her macam one point nine is not enough sia
macam it's like a chain effect

that's why I aku macam shock huh I get express shipping thank you lah
yes and is like cost you a bomb but I did my research what so I actually read up review whoever who bought the same brand uh of roller skates then I see macam okay most of them actually it said that is fit to your true size so you don't have to worry about sizing up or sizing down

like they didn't invite a lot lah but then it's kat Zoom
then they like she invite kawan pun like secondary school just me and another person

kalau aku pun aku memang nak lah sebab macam dia kata kalau during exams kalau lah masa O level aku boleh baca minda orang eh yang duduk depan aku itu budak pandai itu kalau aku boleh baca minda dia mana tahu aku punya results lagi bagus daripada sekarang ke
ya betul-betul boleh baca minda kawan lah kalau dia tengah tipu ke kalau dia tengah jujur ke tak tahu lah kalau orang ini berbual merepek ke you know I mean I guess mind reading is I'd say is pretty powerful to be honest but who knows maybe someday
yang pertama if kalau boleh aku nak
dapat cepat-cepat belajar apa-apa bahasa dalam dunia lah sebab pertama sekali um daripada kecil dulu pergi kelas madrasah selalu dapat dan sudah dapat belajar bahasa arab tapi sampai sekarang pun masih tak boleh err nak cakap satu ayat pun dalam bahasa arab sebab berapa susah nak belajar
so kalau ada peluang bahasa arab
bahasa german dengan italian
aku kalau boleh lah kalau dapat lah nak cuba
um master lah dengan beberapa cepat lah yang kedua kalau boleh saya nak
um belajar masak dengan betul-betul baik
macam faidil kata tadi dia boleh look up to orang macam gordon ramsay yang memang hebat sekali bila masak tapi kalau saya saya tak
ikut lah gordon ramsay kalau boleh pun saya nak ikut emak saya sahaja sebab dia memang satu inspirasi bagi saya dan
kalau saya dah ada berumahtangga kalau ada bini ke saya tak nak bini saya tanggung semua tanggungjawab untuk masak untuk kita dan anak-anak kita so
mana tahu dua tiga minggu sekali saya boleh nak memasak untuk anak kita dan iya lah dapat senangkan untuk semua orang
movie romantic ini memang aku suka lah sebab aku ini suka nangis abeh tengok cerita-cerita macam gini I mean iya lah kalau kalau aku nangis kan memang dapat rasa emosi dia lah bila tengok orang berlakon
tapi macam drama-drama melayu pun banyak dekat tiga ke malaysia astro ke dapat tengok
kebanyakkan cerita romantis kelakar lah tapi
memang aku suka lah
dengan um iya lah I mean other than romance I'd say I mean comedy would be my go to ah
kalau aku ada time capsule being the very nostalgic person I am
jadi aku boleh iya lah kalau sekarang buka aku boleh tengok lah gambar-gambar tersebut kan
and iya lah fikir lah masa sebab dulu masa kita sepuluh sembilan sepuluh tahun tak banyak stress kan dalam hidup
kalau nak bandingkan dengan sekarang tak banyak risau tak tahu apa-apa about the world we don't know how bad the world is nowadays you know just think of yourself a more carefree time
whoa memang menarik itu jawapan dia
I mean duit itu memang penting lah kalau aku aku pun nak duit lah seratus billion dollars itu memang
tak tahu lah nak buat apa eh dah terlalu banyak sangat dah duit dia
um dalam keadaan dunia ini sekarang
aku akan wish untuk semua orang
dengan stable ah sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah
dunia ini pun semakin um semakin mahal untuk tinggal dalam susah untuk keluarga untuk survive kan
so yang pertama I would wish for poverty to end cause
I mean ya um liverpool is a good club I I would like to argue with that but aku rasa chelsea itu memang aku dah lama lah sokong so aku aku tak akan tukar minda aku
aku memang aku memang jealous lah yang liverpool menang title tahun lepas
tapi aku aku rasa kalau aku control chelsea sendiri aku janji tiap-tiap tahun kita akan menang itu aku pastikan so iya lah kalau aku dah sokong itu memang aku tak akan tukar lah eh
kegemaran lah yang
eh nasi pula lauk lemak
and aku and I really like it and I do not know how to make it so
kalau kalau boleh I want to become a journalist cause
iya lah betul lah memang
betul betul betul betul judgemental kan sekarang
so kalau aku boleh pilih
kalau jujur cakap aku nak pilih badan yang sihat lah
daripada muka yang handsome lah
aku akan pilih badan yang lebih sihat lah sebab lebih susah untuk nak turunkan berat badan daripada
lebih baik lah untuk orang lain kan
kalau orang itu badan dia memang bagus ke muka dia betul-betul handsome ke
apa that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
um I just why aku rasa hidup dekat singapura ini sebagai seorang remaja memang
memang laju lah untuk senang kata lah memang laju memang banyak stress banyak yang nak buat
dan ini baru sebelum orang masuk kerja ini belum lagi masuk kerja akan dapat lebih stress
culture di pada negara-negara di asia lah sebab iya lah benda macam um kesihatan mental ini memang
bagi keluarga melayu ke dekat asia ini memang tak diambil berat lah
untuk ibu bapa kan sebab cara mereka dengan cara kita kan tak sama mereka datang daripada zaman yang mungkin lebih susah lah jadi mungkin mereka tak anggapkan kesihatan mental sebagai sesuatu yang penting lah
you wish you could have helped to avoid it but tak boleh so
yang one way or another has been at fault
um when I think about the past twenty years living in singapore I'm very I'm very thankful and memang bersyukurlah dapat pergi sekolah belajar daripada kindergarten sampai sekarang dekat sekolah poly ambil diploma
um dapat buat dengan senang tak ada tak ada bill yang mahal-mahal yang kita kena bayar macam orang yang datang dari luar negara um dekat sini pun um healthcare macam dekat polyclinic ke dekat hospital pun
kita punya apa dia kita punya government kita dapat tolong dapat cover kan dapat bantu and ada um as someone who has two siblings with special needs
and um with that both of us would like to say thank you and have a nice day thank you terima kasih bye bye

aku pun dah lama pun tak pergi batam
terpingin ah
dah lama sia tak pergi batam betul
COVID dah datang apa dah datang semua tak boleh pergi travel pun tak boleh itu pun tak boleh but a lot of people affected right
our friend there all err yang dekat batam semua some of the guides tour guide and then those
pakcik-pakcik yang bawa van ni semua amacam dia orang ah you still keep in touch with err all of them
you mean parking parking as in what macam jaga parking ke apa
kat barelang kan jauh but farming barelang I don't know but can do farming in indonesia what what what
dia tanam apa ah
ah err tanam papaya
and then those err macam seasonal like jagung now I think most of them is planting jagung lah or corn
uh jual pasar
massage mall shop is quiet very quiet takde orang
err because I think dulu dia orang harapkan apa
parlour over there err dah tutup
takde business
then dekat mana shopping mall err I would say
mall the mall is empty tak ramai orang
err like even on the street dekat dekat tengah jalan kat jalan tu kat nagoya tu is very quiet
I left on twenty nine october turun turun jakarta
jumpa kat jakarta then sama-sama balik err
balik balik batam
ah because nak jumpa
so they came from from from dia orang datang dari kampung
ah so jumpa dulu one or two ah one night then proceed lah
then before that you fill up so when you beli when you beli when you buy the ticket at the counter they would want to see this email
sampai kat singapore
I see is bila you dah after in front of the immigration tu there will be cisco officers lah so ah the the immigration will just go signal to them that say okay this one is like that lah
then from there I don't know macam you just wait dekat waiting area then all the all of you all of us will leave in one bus lah
but probably communicate they mention about communication wise is through err macam for me also I don't tak tahu pun where I'm going to
err they did inform ikut jer
I think but I think I think kalau kita tanya they will answer lah but then they didn't I think they are busy sorting out all the all the going here going there kan so that time communication wise I think ya
err nazi semua when you think of nazi is
not not until like that apa is all systematic what singapore
uh uh melebih melebih ah cara-cara the way they discuss sampai ah tu melebih lah kan jadi sama jer macam kita bantu tak tahu kita ikut jer pe
for me is fine but I got I got I don't know the the hotel that I'm in is a whole window so macam
I think they it helps lah dengan apa tu dengan kalau cermin is a small window cermin apa window kecil gitu I will akan rasa stress lah but but because it's a big window
so you know dapat tengok luar
tak stressful lah tu you got a lot of pass time kira kereta berapa ah that is what I do lah in the morning during err peak hours
err randomly kira-kira kereta jalan berapa banyak
macam you know alah you you you you you you are you are when you leave the country you should be prepared that you will be getting through this which is good enough that you get a good hotel a decent hotel apa
ah berpada ah you know some country another negeri dapat tempat is really really bad
for me is just alhamdulillah lah you know dapat makan you get a good hotel then after that a good bed for two weeks
I mean it's your it's choice lah how macam mana kita nak nak tu kan how how you nak nak how you want to make use of
what you have apa yang kita ada tu ah ya lah like I have for me iya lah tu lah kita duduk duduk tu kira appreciate but for me is that I got that room I I got that whole window I appreciate that very much lah
ah tak tak tak terasa terkongkong tu jer
ah sekarang jadi malas ah dah dua minggu makan tidur makan tidur sleep err
do my deliveroo lah but to do work lah so during weekend weekend nak kena kerja weekend we have to work
I work I work eh dua shift dua shift err either start at eight
err eleven so macam eight they cover breakfast kalau err
cover lunch lunch err eleven have to start all the way already lah all the way until petang ah until evening
alhamdulillah lah really really for me is that alhamdulillah macam you know you control for me is that you control how much you want to earn
you you you you know how much are you you know how much you can earn macam berapa banyak kita boleh apa kita boleh earn ah so if you you need that money if you need more you work have to work a bit hard lah
nanti nak kena fikir thinking macam mana
how is it gonna be a new year tahun ni eh
pukul satu pagi semua kat block agaknya
I believe uh macam neighbourhood ada dia punya apa tu bunga api sikit eh sikit-sikit sikit-sikit okay lah like that
singapore yang the officially close the border
macam the hundred dollars you can only take a bit a bit a bit sikit-sikit kan
tu lah that's why I'm thinking mana nak pergi
macam aduh
next year boleh after new year
apa sea aquarium uh belum pergi uh
adventure cove tak buka kan ah ah belum buka lagi ah aku tunggu juga
jap pergi supper dok just but
I think macam eh kita ni macam singaporean kan lucky lah macam beruntung
appreciate macam you should appreciate apa kita apa ni
apa yang kita dapat apa-apa what our government give us ah yes yes yes
macam how to say ah macam
dulu macam kita for last time when we are here abeh kita tengok macam tengok this year how come you know  mak dia orang ni everyday dia punya cases naik macam tak jaga kan ah but when when you are there then you realise lah err that sometimes you know it's not that they don't macam dia orang tak nak
tapi looking at their economy
and with azan lain macam dia orang kan kebanyakkannya
gaji hari then kalau kena quarantine empat belas hari
ah betul itu lah itu dia orang tu nak quarantine susah macam kalau dia orang empat belas hari siapa nak kasih makan keluarga
ah tu macam tu lah kadang-kadang bukan dua orang tak nak kan but then
negara tu kan
nak nak quarantine lah that kind of stuff
oh macam sometimes the government ada kasih until when the amount to reach them it's it's not the original amount lah
ah along along along along the way itu
ada potong potong potong itu lah situasi sebetulnya
kurang uh uh
then also masa err some of them
no they don't dia orang tak nak pergi hospital sebab
kita too negative
apparently for every untuk setiap orang yang mereka hantar to pergi refer the hospital get money
not under table is government government bayar so hospital tu hospital tu will just say you're positive
ah ah satu
I just don't know that's why for untuk orang local ini nak pergi hospital
ah and if you speak to most of them semua semua gitu ah because initially I thought this is full macam tak this is bullshit right sekali but then berbual dengan orang sana berbual lepas tu orang-orang A orang B orang C kan
they give semua jawapan semua sama dia orang takut nak pergi hospital hospital dapat duit
no they no no they they check they check lah no they check they they pergi swab test tapi came back is positive lah
but bila bila kat sana ambil dah negative
for them janji aku dapat duit sudah
uh uh takut semua orang takut
tu lah kan
kesian but kesian orang-orang yang malaysia kan
ah tu macam you saw pasal saiful punya video tu
yang sebelah causeway ah just the causeway tu
setulang dekat ah tu ah R&F dia dekat woodland woodland checkpoint tepi tu
I I think I think dia nikah kat johor
huh I think singapore I mean kat johor yang dia married
officially tu dekat johor tak johor johor mm mm
sorry dia balik
under spouse kat johor malaysia
leave dengan no pay leave lah everything for two months in malaysia ah
eh duit balik tu lagi mahal tau
uh empat ribu enam ratus I was talking to him I was I was talking to him I say
even for malaysian malaysian pun dia orang nak kena bayar I think two thousand plus eh
ya malaysia ni dia orang dia orang how to say eh kalau step step step apa macam like they are strict lah ah tempatnya I don't know ah but I think if talking about strictness lah I think malaysia lebih strict than singapore for in terms of their immigration tinggi
tapi tu lah dia orang
kat yang dalam locally tu lah
that's why told him lah you know it depends have to bayar but then

eh dah lama tak jumpa
yeah I'm just my friend is just to find a jobs lah flexible part time jobs you know to suit my schedule especially like my intern is not paid right  abih kena cari kerja sendiri lah
 asal boring what you doing at home
yes it almost three years already and we are gonna graduate next year  tak sabar rasanya
stress kan  kena buat ni semua but I'm glad  macam its all over already lah now dah holiday  boleh enjoy
 apa was the assignment about duh
 apa itu I tak faham
err so far only  satu je lah like one module err we learn about airport management it's quite interesting lah cause you get to learn about the operations behind a airports right like how the run or what what other things involved yeah
oh my dream job is to be stewardess lah like cause  macam you know that time the first time I took a flight to penang then the stewardess served me right then from there I was like inspired I want to be like them
so from there  macam I work hard lah to you know I do research about aviation about stewardess all these
yeah that was one of my dreams  tapi macam susah lah  nak jadi pilot you need a lot of qualification yeah so now I just want to be a stewardess first lah I see lah if
I want to work at singapore airlines lah but  banyak orang cakap susah nak masuk ah because high standard  semua so now I looking for maybe other travel budget airlines like the Scoot or Jetstar asia
oh sekarang ni I I tengah tengok drama korea ah korea ah cerita lama lah cerita legend of the blue sea
just now I eat ah  nasi with  kari daging
wah  sedap nya
 boleh jugak your mom  masak semua
 macam hari raya pulak
yeah but then like my other friends they  banyak kena campak dekat err company  yang tak related to aviation  macam logistics then like some of them will be like under administration or marketing that kind of job
 belum susah cause  aku tengah cari flexible or adhoc kind of job kan  tapi mostly like they want you know minimum commitment three to four days a week that kind and like you know office hours yeah so hard lah I need to find a flexible one because I scared if they ask me to come to the changi airport then if I working the part time job then I cannot go there how you know so I need to prioritize my intern first
yeah because because like I said lah like the participation never all actually I do participate but I just don't unmute my mic because I don't dare and like ya lah a bit  takut ah when if you talk then you will talk alone
good lah was it a  macam manageable or stressful
 abih kau macam mana macam ada plans  nak buat business eh
tak they see eh I see like they sell those gadgets you know like speakers lah
just like the other cafes  semua those that sell the mains all yeah
 sikit sikit lama lama jadi bukit
yeah this one also actually I I don't want it to be at somewhere ulu somewhere err a place people cannot find
you know like some cafes like in the ulu places right then people want to
and cannot be ulu lah like I said
 sekarang
you mean like malay food  ke
 tauhu bergedil lah I I love that  tauhu bergedil then what else ah bubble tea the what ah oh that time I saw err dalgona bubble tea or something
yeah mostly all at bugis east area like you said lah in the west also not much  halal options cause very boring lah east is the best lah because they have a lot of good food there
a'ah  kalau kereta senang boleh pergi mana mana jer  jauh jauh pon takpe because very convenient
 selalu pergi lah  kadang kadang malam malam ikut err  abah aku pergi isi minyak isi minyak kereta err  pastu kita orang gi makan burger or we go McDonald's right then eat their burger is so nice duh I like their McDonald's menu
yeah but Ramly  dari sana but then I don't like because err  banyak sayur
oh I I've eaten before um  apa tu
it it is okay leh not is like it is a bit like err  ayam and  daging ah
I mean  daging beef a bit a bit like that it just a bit  keras
there's also err burger  arnab
I don't know why I was daring to try that deer meat lah you know cause like I'm there already so  mak I say just try something new because I like to explore what I like to try new food
then that stall also they got sell the  ais kacang
 senang ah  nak cari makanan halal untuk kita
ah I miss also I want to go the  tapak food truck
yeah like the food range for maybe seven  ringgit onwards
that time I bought the buttermilk chicken rice it's ten  ringgit
talking about  nasi lemak I remember that time I went
 abih err  kita orang makan  nasi lemak  dengan lauk lauk lauk pauk you know  nasi lemak then I I  taruk err  ayam of course  ayam ah  ayam goreng
then  taruk like some other  lauk ah like the  sambal telur you know  sambal kerang wah it's really nice
 halal food options so it's so easy for us to find  halal food so like at our hotel right err just across the street there's already like two to three  halal restaurants then as you go down the street there is more option for you lah
 tak I  pergi jogjakarta
 mertabak manis
 sedap gila seh I  suka gila
I've been getting a lot of comments  macam bapak aku dengan pak cik aku cakap eh dah dah dah  apa eh
uh huh dah  tembam
confirm boring lah your house  takde pape nak buat kan  takde three lah  takde
but then we just ignore it then we set up our picnic mat and all lah then  sekali like a few minute after that we can see like on the right side the clouds are very dark and
 sedap it just fruits lah for nothing less berries blueberries that kind of berries
no this is five dah lama
 tapi cause we are too small and mostly is
macam main bawah blok sia tu bro
eh anyway sekarang david moyes kat mana siol
oh dia sekarang manage west ham oh west ham eh ah how did west ham do in their oh they lost against new castle
and you know we we've got these we've got these dia macam kau macam you just look at this guy
and you're like okay dah settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
so that's why mourinho selalunya dia nya team err their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
klopp and mourinho ni macam dorang macam opposite sides of the spectrum ah in a way ah
apa swan eh swan swan and harry kane
sun sun ke swan
okay ya lah I mean it's like it's like championship manager ah right oh no no best is the best is like FIFA what am I saying okay okay sorry sorry aku dah lupa defence ni apa
how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone aku
okay lah takpe lah anyway ah I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing ah cause you know I've just uh
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so pada aku macam
I I like what Netflix does these days eh dorang ada macam ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
sial lah bro that one macam for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
kau zuleika zulkifli actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
tell all documentary ah an anelka and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything macam basically
aku rasa nama dia macam gitu ah I mean he's muslim name is supposedly bilal but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
like one was the the france punya
and macam pada anelka it was not fair ah like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
okay so so so basically macam I've watched cobra kai I've watched err I mean I don't tend to watch the series ah I would watch like documentaries or macam movies ah so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting ah
err social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now uh it's about how macam Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants kan dorang basically
dorang tahu like what attracts you what what you're interested in uh
so dorang buat macam uh and if not an avatar they like what do you call it lah
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like macam they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why macam Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
sia ah why do they think this way sia asal dorang fikir macam gitu like dia
kau how can people just support sia macam tak masuk akal but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya lah usually it's either very insidious thingy ah
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like macam lost his faith a bit lah cause one of the themes of the movie
after he has a son of his own he starts to macam go back to
like worshipping god ah no macam macam it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like macam ya lah orang beragama pun macam
kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu that sort of thing so macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang for like five years lepas tu dia macam eh astgahfirullah aku kena qadak balik solat aku
ya so so so that's a tragedy macam something happens and then after that he he has this macam love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like macam ah
you know that twilight fella lah huh ya the glittery vampire so dia yang sekarang
okay shouldn't stereotype err pastor dorang
okay lah so it's an lah it's not the Android box yang Android box yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada kan tu benda kan
no he was in house of cards and and err house of cards the final season just macam tergantung macam gitu apa
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang cause of all the
religious upbringing to say like eh ni benda salah sia what am I doing you know that sort of thing so macam I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no lah no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like macam it won't have been like once every few months ah which is the situation you find it you find now ah
dia panggil kau sir but asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau seh
check it out I I was wrong okay lah I mean I think I can tell this to the camera eh to the camera pula to the recorder okay I was from serangoon right
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like ini aizat adam ni semua like eh ya eh eh you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school dulu
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude lah but but macam
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many uh malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese lah macam you won't find a malay chap in the in that class ah
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times nanti aku google aku check kan lepas tu aku aku aku forward dekat kau lah
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that uh inhibits our society ah but basically ya lah back to what we were saying macam aku rasa that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference apa betul tak like
ya macam one thing about us mungkin err compared to kita punya parents eh macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita tend to macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita you know like our parents aku rasa dorangnya generations is like kau kenal ni satu perempuan
within a few months tunang another few months kahwin you know that sort of thing
what was that so so so you see eh macam what ondre said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different ah you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case ah macam like oh it was a norm ah like oh your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants ah you know so macam like
orang pakistan kat sini will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now ah so maybe kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa then talk talk talk eh I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing ah macam it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to ah but of course I mean
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that macam err syed ahmad was interested in your mother
um okay so what was that okay so basically macam ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing ah so macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir sia eh anak aku
I think girls these days they are like lagi beza dari kita macam in the sense that they are really pressured to
susceptible to this ah macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa in a way lah but aku rasa untuk wanita ni
dorang lebih senang dipengaruh ah pada aku ah ah like compared to guys ah macam I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife macam
ah kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah you know that sort of thinking you know
where they provide a place for you to do the walimah kan
a still somewhat rare for the whole majlis from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like masjid mawaddah
no but bartley is like macam bartley is is is so called not really
I'm trying to say is that macam nowadays you have instances where people do say like eh should we have our majlis in a mosque cause then like orang nak sembahyang and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like macam it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding what you know in a way lah but of course
pada aku pun aku rasa macam if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a walimah a small walimah outside the mosque ah
okay ah not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam that was
something that that was on her mind like macam eh why are we doing it in the mosque abeh macam like oh I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but pada aku macam like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
eh why you buying a three room flat sia it's so macam aku rasa macam I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure ah I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning ah
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way macam at the end of the day you just have to be
ya huh ya ya aku dah end of this month eh end of this month eh end of this year dah enam tahun
aku fikir aku nak upgrade to macam five room ke ah
sengkang juga
bro bro tampines mahal bro tampines mahal gila no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so tak ah tu abbas nya parents aku sengkang apa
basically basically okay basically basically sengkang right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale lah so for those people who don't know sengkang you know is divided into this so called macam four districts gitu lah so err anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this sungai lah
it's called the sungai punggol I think ah so like if you look out my window here you can see the sungai ah
so that sungai punggol err is the boundary between sengkang which is held by the workers' party and ang mo kio which is held by pinky work
you should talk to my cousin abbas ah who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me eh kalau kau suka breaking bad kau kena watch this better call saul lah
so aku macam aku ada tengok ah like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while aku macam how many seasons are there oh my god breaking bad only has five seasons
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where abang dia yang very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
okay I I think roughly around at that point aku dah macam
kan there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle dia macam terus didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya lah but he kept on macam like downplaying si jimmy nya achievement ah dia macam cakap you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing kan
and the witcher ke apa witcher witcher pun aku tak tengok sangat
eh prison break si dia tu dah mati kan the actual dah mati kan the guy who plays michael scofield lah
okay let me google this michael scofield mati
so is season five good or not dorang ada tulis prison break season six lagi tak ah
the movie was not on the ni ni kan the movie was on siapa eh only the final break
shucks ah ikram stop getting me hooked back on all this crap lah malas sial nak pergi tengok ni semua
oh my god stop sia kau
aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh once I see macam satu benda ni ada four five seasons kan
aku terus lemah ah aku macam no lah I cannot watch this sia
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass punya app
mine is after iPhone eight lah basically boleh ah so so so it's one of those things that I don't know ah Apple fan boys are talking about these days ah
double double tap then the code keluar
the scanner the scanner the scanner keluar not the code the camera thingy ya
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code ah macam ni kau tengok ayatul kursi
no no no that's that's if you can lah kat bawah tu kan
then it goes ayatul kursi
there kat bawah kat bawah sini
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this dia macam go
so uh inshallah with ah I also reciting ayatul kursi we will get our twenty dollars and err we can spend it on a steak later at jalan kayu
shall we talk about our favourite makan places since it's almost lunch
tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana ah
tapi I've never heard of it being described as a good place lah
babe aku pun aku pun I know I know err anchorvale
dorang ada the vending machine cafe ah if that's what you are referring to
the yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung
yes so yassin kampung they have this off shoot called lepak one corner
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot lepak one corner it it doesn't feel like the lepak place ah it feels like you just go in kau beli makan dekat no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
okay ya good joke but ah so then macam apa tau dia macam tempat makan dia eh dia macam okay kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam queue up dekat the stall ah so it's like a hawker stall ah it's like a hawker centre
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like abeh kau kena pergi sana order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that makanan dia okay lah not bad lah but pada aku macam so so juga but it doesn't have the lepak feeling lah
because like pada aku lepak feeling macam kau kau duduk then like eh bhai teh tarik lagi satu ah eh if you want to go place you should go to mahamoodiya
yes the one next to the Shell eh dorang dah up market sia
then aku realise
mahal sia it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the apa last week of the year what
kan then aku tak tahu macam mana like we need to have more options I guess
but unless we go for the apa ah smaller rooms ah
that one untuk yang the suite room so aku rasa macam besar sangat I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
aku rasa boleh ah but I think it's about dalam empat ratus gitu
aku rasa ah
ya I think aku rasa for now empat orang but
the price confirm makin mahal
botanic gardens theme ah the boy bunga theme
oh ya dia belum decide right
prime is hard to find you know there's only like berapa jer dalam singapore ni tau nak cari
kipas oh it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know sebelah-sebelah leh like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
ya bodoh so big sia
ya so what is just the four of us ah xing jing oh no with the others right because we doing dinner dengan yang lain-lain kan malam so
kau plan lah then kau bilang kita then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
ya they bodoh
this is christmas so tak payah lohei
I think dinenr can go all out lah I guess not all out as in macam terus
apa sakan ah but more like a
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve lah I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the makanan will dia ada server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
he kena bullied
what what do you mean location kena change you mean the buffet town run away or what
for the dinner dia orang boleh eh
um terrence I haven't check with him yet tapi aku rasa maybe dia tak boleh because that week he's going back to school already
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least macam tujuh puluh percent untuk
dia orang go to phase three lah so
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members lah yang tinggal dalam serumah right
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas punya dinner kan
so aku tak tahu ah macam mana like
bo pian lah kan macam tak boleh apa
I mean technically it's not even a macam public holiday on that day right
I think he never go there before so you should be safe dia tak ada benchmark untuk tempat tu
then the next morning he will aku rasa go to the work straight
so the tuesday morning aku rasa he has to go back to work lor
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday punya time slot I mean err rates ya
masih ah kau taiwan
ya it was that one I go on march it was macam sejuk ah tapi macam just like aircon kind yes
the he say macam apa like
he's not going they are not going to macam vaccinate everybody kat singapore
tak tahu save duit agaknya
apa purpose kan I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat they can just spread to each other lah
oh cactus cactus yang kecil-kecil gitu eh then
dua cactus
no the normal cactus yang besar dia ada thorns then macam bulat-bulat gitu and dia punya shape
straight then bulat-bulat eh right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
kau siak ah hey mahal pokok tu
kau tanam pokok durian jer lah
the experts say lah the lockdown causes more macam apa problems than benefits ya
macam dulu dia tak pakai grab but sekali now oh I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it lah rather than kau tahu macam kalau tak ada COVID like everybody is still
macam oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay lah aku rasa
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money untuk
aku rasa okay lah
bagus lah kan macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef kat rumah kan semua buat dalgona coffee macam kau
you will just stuck at home with your family lah you got no choice but just to interact dengan dia orang like
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like kalau kau baca that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
then aku rasa like I think they dia orang tak concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
I mean during the even like dia punya apa
so they don't really care about that part aku tak tahu but
it just go without the track what sia bodoh
iya lah confirm ada lah
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then macam suddenly kau dalam hutan tu kau introduce monyet kau introduce pangolin kau introduce lemur pelanduk I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya ni bukan library tau kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil tau
so they have to kill or macam that one lah like what chicken flu like that eh bird flu chicken flu
sekali coronavirus from plants leh
kau masih tau
I only need to buy one plant untuk taruh dalam office aku
but actually mati a very terrible death to do
ya sia kau teruk sia
then we got scraping benda tu

ya usually events that kind of pokok lah you know like those

then in the end we go there then because we got no bento no jala no what so in the end we use rod stand
rod stand the metal rod stand then we we just asar the tip make sure it's slightly sharper lah we go inside the water
we see we see we see one crab we whack so all the crabs right the twenty plus ah all got one lubang

err the behind the crab island lah ah pulau ubin he was there at pulau ubin then after that so I I told err hakim eh err nak nak tukar tu ah umpan because he's
then I ask him eh you don't want to open your rod campak umpan then he was like nanti ah tengok then I was like okay lah tak apa ah I go I go change my umpan
the the rest of them was doing their umpan on the left side so I went to their right side
then ambil ah udang hidup pegang lah benda tu goyang-goyang then tengah tengah dah dah dah
dah poke ah dah poke the udang
then dah campak dah campak dah rilek ah then I was like ya tengok it was it's a nice scenery lah then then I realised I I heard something on the right side then I was like itu apa tu then I I listen closely lah
then it was actually azan ah ah three
three azan I don't know azan buat lah terkejut I also don't know lah
ya three ah azan then I was like azan eh then because I look to the I look inside I look inside the forest then it was pitch dark
then I was like the only the only way this can be like real ah if there is a kampung beside lah
so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask nos eh nos beside yang tempat we pancing got kampung ah then tak ada lah then I was like
oh tak ada ah pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan
I heard ada macam ada orang tengah azan and I I stood there for quite some time lah just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly lah eh kau tak bilang ah
oh kau tak kejut aku then I was like apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ
so he was like um tertidur
then he tried to sleep you know ah he always try to sleep when he pancing one then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then dia pusing pusing pusing then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree lah kat tengah-tengah in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree lah then he saw one nenek one nenek
walk pass then he was like ah the nenek told him like cu cu dah tahu sini tempat keras kan asal malap jer di tempat you eh macam tempat you pula eh no no no not that
why why um malap jer tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight lah but that day he just never on it lah then
apa tu err macam this one is mystics lah like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
keep quiet then rilek-rilek then the nenek um turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that lah
then the driver say got one time he was passing by ah at night ah then he actually saw at the pokok there ada err pocong ah tengah
so it it means that like that nenek come to actually warn them that that place very malap then got other stuff also lah then that that nenek just go there to warn them lah like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice lah but it's just malam ya malam kena jaga-jaga ya
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this one is where the driver will drive eh drive then this is an open area di sini ada satu pokok in the middle
path ah actually the right path also can you will see pulut ketam in front of you that stretch like that ah towards the tip lah you can see the whole tip of pulau ketam
then your past few days macam mana your past few months ah ah the time the last
time I met you then you say you just berhenti kerja pe you just stop work
so apa you you apply mostly what type of apa industry
what phone call eh kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau english all the way eh have you never notice beginning
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the cerita so kau dah apply kerja habis semua tak dapat ah all all rejected you
sakit hati ah
surrounding have a few other masjid in the east
no lah I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background juga kan
you will need to come in and explain to them oh tak lah this the way the reason why I letak the moderator first then followed by the asatizah then followed by err fandi ahmad is because
um according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever uh I know that first kau kena letak the moderator first
why why why the moderator first pasal dia yang akan moderate everything then followed by the asatizah who are
no lah to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of macam situasi lah
ya that's why lah that's not like you said lah is tak professional lah
of course is the comic lah because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group akan dibawa naikkan to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that dalam kamu punya age group lah so it's better for you in that sense ah
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera dah berapa mahal then err the time you took to edit I actually
pernah I pernah help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge ah tentang video ah the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship lah then after that then apa tu the thing is
kenapa tak ada any background in Photoshop ke apa ke so nak edit tak tahu macam mana nak edit so I ask you for help that time
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was tak susah because tak banyak animation tak banyak at that time lah it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence itu pun dah boleh jadi gila
then ya I understand because as a programmer nanti I do some programs ke apa and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti eh hakim um actually the client tak suka uh this part of the game ah can change it then dalam hati aku macam what it took me hours to get that part working
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research tengok whether apa tu apa yang client tu nak is feasible tak can it be included
into the program itself macam the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so oh sakit
true story actually sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap
no lah is is just pelik lah
dah start merepek
you know the back to the story sikit right just now I talk about my intern so my intern kan I was being paid err one thousand dollars
eh rilek ah rilek ah dengar dulu but but the thing is the time err I'm from
so bila kita um want to sign up for apa tu for internship you need to go through this website ah I forgot what's the website oh my apa website dia ah
ada lah website tu ada ada lah masih situ ah
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to gaji so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over ah fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through gaji like which one is higher pay lah
then I went in then I went in rilek-rilek talk with my colleagues then got other interns juga situ they are leaving already
then I was like eh your gaji berapa ah how much kau dapat every month one thousand huh eh one thousand sikitnya
wah sikitnya one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like oh according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know lah but
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like apa hal ni
malas you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay ah once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay lah rezeki di mana-mana
no you will say can boleh macam mana oh you need to sign up this you need to do that ah tak apa
Grab lah last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see macam dia punya timeline ah like what do you
kau cakap kau nak kerja Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo oh betul eh jauh
if you if you hustle even more macam hustle demi hustle jer is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
if you really can't get anything because apa tu okay lah I got learn some finance also lah kan you should know lah so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in lah rather than just duit terkeluar duit terkeluar then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the rezeki belum masuk lagi in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering dulu lah then while delivering then you can because when you do part time
take off like okay ah pukul sebelas sebelas sampai pukul empat ah I want to do delivery I got nothing much to do so it's it's quite a good
from your house sini jalan kaki punggol sengkang further eh macritchie further
mana seh
kenapa tu kenapa ada kick tu how long
dulu twenty four click take so long
macam might as well lah I park my motor somewhere
you got listen to misteri jam dua belas or not
huh tak ah aku tak berani I mean aku takut kena kacau sekali tu aku dah takut ya eh I think I told you right that time then ya I was studying at home I think I was twelve ah I was studying at home right then the the
eh you let's listen together no no I add sound effects what the hell I mean you know my place my areas sana banyak keras kan shit lah
dulu eh kau tinggal situ
wait your house is dekat fuchun fuchun primary baru ke fuchun primary lama is it near marsiling primary
ya ya ya ya I know mm you know what is keras right one look you know that is keras
I I only went to the old fuchun for apa tu for uh orientation I was like my first year in my primary school because but my first my first uh my first year in primary school was at the new one it's just that when I orientation it was at the old one
I don't know but I remember I think I think your parents apply for primary school then they give you like macam mana I think you bid when I think it's bidding right is it by bidding or something no I think for uh apa tu pun sama kan uh the kindergarten I think because my sister she did the same thing I think she bid for placement
so it's not enough place they'll put you another place ya they said fuchun was uh one of the best primary schools there a lot produces a lot of uh apa they say a lot of high scorpions and which is true ah
old uh old fuchun was haunted new fuchun was okay lah I mean it was not as keras
like apa evergreen they didn't have like brownies it was red cross or then there was then I was like mm okay lah red cross sounds like similar sekali I join aku join
I mean it wasn't hard I mean I join I enjoyed it it was just different because brownies was like uh buy my cookies you know like uh uh was an elf or like a pixie you know then you will learn how to cook learn how to sew but brownie was like was really like you know footdrills ya they really make sure you do so like you're you know you like ya because you had to do evacuation and things like that first aid my specialty was red cross knowledge history basically like the history we learn we had to learn about apa tu the founder lah things like that apa tu
I only had apa eh
kesian got try got try
masak we we learnt how to not really it's like nutrition is a bit like like like nutrition ah like our current nutrition class it's just that was more they they need more hands on cooking
had to cook ya I had to put during fasting month batal sia legit terbatal puasa aku I was like unconsciously I was like hmm rasa masin tak shit ya I was like ya oh my god oh no then I was like am I supposed to spit it out my friends was like ah batal jer lah then I was like alahai shit lah tak sengaja then ya you can okay lah I mean I felt guilty for like I was like okay lah batal batal lah it's fine I ganti anyways
err like basically musical theory then they taught us to play recorder pianica entah
I was in charge of the gong but it's like apa tu
but I was late once and they had to switch me over or something then I change it's like ya the drum is like I forgot what's the name of the instrument but it's like one side is smaller one side is bigger then ya I wanted to use the kompang kompang you know or the or the small one no not rebana it's the it's the long one then it's like it's the you know you know apa tu
err pontianak harum sundal malam you know the long one the metal with the round thing at the top ya then ya I wanted to play that that's a part of gamelan gamelan is the name of the whole thing what orchestra bukan xylophone panjang-panjang wait ya it's something like xylophone lah ah bulat-bulat
ya lah I had to uh I had to masuk gamelan play guitar piano had to learn piano apa tu ha they made us dance they made us fusion dance then uh contempt I was like oh my god do I look like I can dance hmm
I'm more of a musician ha me is not uh apa tu dancer you know saya bukan penari ya I was like okay ah apa tu then for sports we had to learn floorball in primary school floorball
then apa tu
played a lot lah we played a lot I was good at sports but when you know you had to run around like run around the field you know to warm up I'm like orh tak nak tak nak tak nak then it's like
qiam jer
ya it was rumah orang kan
buat bodoh jer
primary five then secondary school sec two you know always they had the night walks right it was at the you know those really old camps did you watch okay you watched incredible tales right you saw yang you know about the the the the
kena like kena jalan lah macam dia orang tarukkan glow stick kan lepas tu
dia orang apa tu dia orang bagi kau jalan dengan the first person kena pegang dia punya torchlight then yang belakang tu you know then macam kena taruk tangan atas bahu
caterpillar gitu ha I was usually either the first or the last one because I wasn't scared you know I'm not scared lah so but the weirdest thing you at what for some reason once kan what happened was aku tengah like everything was okay like it it started out fine
when we went to the camps when we tried to come back to the campsite lah so basically after the uh night the first mission night walk right then they had a briefing then tepuk ah something like that we walked back to the campsite that I somehow tripped tripped but I didn't really trip because it was
but the what weird like apa tu
benda yang pelik yang terjadi kan actually selepas tu
like so basically kan like okay so I was injured so I I fell so I I sprained my ankle kan so yang dia punya faci dia kan the eh no a teacher wanted to take a shorter cut lah because I was injured right so they uh they brought three of us took the shorter cut by the time we sampai dia punya campsite kan
I don't know they they they were getting ready to eat apa tu supper eh ya then they showered already then one of my friends like err apa tu where where did you go lah right why you said I thought you take shortcut oh why you take so long ah I'm uh then aku macam
aku tak tahu sia
I don't know I don't know it didn't feel very long it felt like it was short but the problem is when we reach everyone was either showered or the last few are showering you know that kan so you can you think do you like people shower you you get the girls and all lama juga lah kan ha lama juga so I was oh my god until now I can't figure out what happened but ya
it's near a madrasah also right
why would you put your kubur there tanah ah
kampung sia what I'm weird is one thing that is that in the hustle and bustle of the city
macam kampung pula kan
no I think they know because I went to search up on you know where to visit you know we we always do those visits right and I was searching where to visit ah then I saw this one place they said kubur melayu tengah-tengahnya apa tu kat bugis juga I think
like beside that's why when the moment you said oh kat bugis right then I was like is it near the near the madrasah and when you said yes I know about this story it's quite famous lah I mean who would think
kan I mean the only time I experienced that was that time kampung lah
aku nak pergi surau because I used to I used to stay over at my pakcik's house right and
my pakcik and makcik orang malaysia right orang malaysia kau tau lah rumah dia orang kat kampung-kampung kan so one one of the kampung is kalau nak daripada surau dah habis solat nak kena jalan balik tu kena lalu kubur
okay lah okay it was fine it was fine it was because you know you pergi surau you won't go alone what especially because I budak singapore kan mana orang nak bagi anak pergi sana especially because malaysia you know ah there's a lot of those cases right so
banyak ah bukan culik jer habis
so it's like I mean seram is seram but yang paling seram is one of my uncle's house dekat ni jalan tan kee it's kat eh but I think they move ah already it was damn dilapidated
it's like the area was macam it was how to say ah they want to
pecahkan they want to pecahkan and nak buat rumah baru but it's like dia orang tak nak move because they were miskin kan so it's like apa tu
like as a kid I was like entah I don't know but it smelt really bad so as a kid you know biasa lah you know very particular right so tak nak tak nak masuk tunggu dalam van but we me and my cousin got stuck in the van the lock rosak ya they had to send it to a kedai to get it fixed but anyways lah so basically it's like you know it's the really old kampung type like you want shower right must go out ya it's under the pokok then my mum was like when I was showering with my mum my mum was like jangan tengok atas
pokok kekabu weh
no it's open air it's zinc oak lah it's just a zinc panels sebelah kiri kanan habis you know it's the dia punya tempat air dia orang simpan air kat tempayan you know those
ya it's like you know those kimchi kimchi jars yes they put water in it dah rupa baldi tau habis dah lah air sejuk
aku nangis sumpah aku tak berani aku tak berani pergi toilet sorang-sorang tau aku kalau pergi toilet masa kat kampung ibu ibu pergi ibu pergi lah sorang ibu no I'm not going to go alone toilet dah lah kat luar tengah-tengah malam masa tu nak shower sorang-sorang you know you imagine my family from singapore all the way to all the way to malaysia kan then you take bath all the way then melekit kalau tak tak nak solat lagi
ya but I mean I shower because it was with my mum but imagine if I was I was alone I will not shower I don't know how my sister went to shower alone oh my god dah lah masa tu tengah ada case apa tu you know they masa that one is early two thousand still got case of apa tu orang minyak ke apa kan something like that
pengamal pengamal they they they practise like magic no they amal it like
you you know how some you know how some people buang dia orang punya pad darah dia orang kan dia orang nak lawa kan dia orang nanti ambil dia orang baca-baca dia orang ambil dia orang punya darah uzur tu dia orang taruk kat muka dia orang baca-baca that's how lah dia orang amal lah macam orang ya because like you know how they simpan jin simpannya hantu raya simpannya simpannya cik kak kan apa
balik kampung no
no I don't know I don't know eh I think I don't know eh is it I also don't know but I I still don't know the difference I only recently found out all the difference between langsuir and pontianak
oh yang nenek tu eh
bomoh eh
is it the makcik bomoh that one that episode
ya the one that the guy potong kuku malam-malam then the guy the other guy bukanya payung dalam rumah kan ya ya why what's your question
apa apa no penanggal penanggal lain do you realise it's the same thing because nananggal is the philippines term for penanggal penanggal is melayu
you will realise that okay you realise that a lot of the folklore right it's similar because we live in the same region you know if you check our genealogy kan philippines indonesia melayu orang orang singapore yes correct we are all basically the same ethnicities just that because of the you know the like they they split up and things like that aiya anyways but ya it's actually the same folklore lah
that's why you said lady in white right for us it's pontianak you were saying
oh one of the one of the oh it wasn't in the it wasn't in the oh ya ya ya ya ya the penanggal yang takde so basically the apa tu the organs that one right ya it's not a joke my dad used to oh ya you know I I did the interview right so basically uh for our interview for the coding in school right for class so my dad actually used to work for telcom
you know zaman dulu is yang apa tu tali dia hanging kan kat atas it wasn't underground like now kan ya so basically singapore ha kat kat malaysia tak lah kat singapore lah so basically like apa tu they had to change dia punya lines kadang-kadang kalau kadang-kadang dia uh telephone lama dia orang kan rosak then he was one of the people who go and repair
ya it was ah it's technician ah electric punya technician so basically what happened was that you know if you tukar senja-senja you'll see sometimes the penanggal head will get stuck at the at the hanging lines
no how to say eh penanggal is not really macam it's not like hantu raya it's not like pontianak it's not dead oh it's practice they say eh they pengamal they like orang minyak kan amal black magic so it's like apa tu
ha they practise ah but I don't remember what was the reason I know I know err orang minyak is to be good looking or something
I don't remember I think he was ugly or something then he say that he wants to like he was sick of people making fun of him or something aku tak ingat right no no no he made a made a perjanjian dengan syaitan then to like to make himself look handsome LOL then that's called something called plastic surgery sia plastic surgery
but like I kind of understand because when you work with not bomoh lah but you work with syaitan right it's natural I guess I mean the fact that you don't have
entah lah suka hati kau lah nak
oh dia nak makan anak dia I think
oh awet muda
you know the story about the there are like people I remember one of the incredible tales and actually it happened if you I don't know if you notice but when people get uh malay people pregnant right they will put things under their what was it pillow put things at their tingkap
I guess it's kind of make sense but I mean if it was a follow ah they say that err they put because they are this one jin or ghost kan hantu kan that will actually steal the baby ya it's the same jin that you were telling me that day we were talking about that day I think
scared the heck out of me they eat the ya the rahim they they eat the janin right they that's why they say what zaman dulu maghrib jer tutup tingkap then they then they will hang like paku-paku atau punya apa tu
garam kind of I don't know this I don't know for some reason garam is apparently quite useful in like islamic practices right they use it as border ya I don't know is that I don't know is that how my dad pagar rumah or not but ya
ya they say what is it ah what what daun apa also not ketumbar but they say LOL ketumbar untuk makan there's one daun they use to like apa tu
I don't know what's the name of the daun but it's like
ya I I they say that it cleanses something no I don't remember but if I remember I'll tell you but it's like ya they say it clean like apa tu uh
anasir-anasir sihir or something like that
they said they use it for kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke they use the daun or something I don't remember this one daun they even sell sabun or like sabun because who want to buy daun and go and clean yourself
use it's the same idea as tanah liat you know so you touch pig or dog you can just wipe what ya technology ya
but ya actually a lot of the jins are quite chicken sia I heard a lot of people right need to be careful like you know people give birth right you don't know who the one who sambut the baby
I mean like I said lah the the the jin we were talking about this it eats uh it steals babies and things like that that's why they say what actually the the reason behind oh need to go back inside the house uh uh sebelum maghrib right
but ya you can you imagine the doctor when got nurse then sekali got extra nurse the one that sambut your baby oh no oh my god hell no because my mum says that it's very keras lah that's why I was so scared when I was hospitalised early this year I was like but then again new places also got things what everywhere got things what even talking about them right now confirm they'll be like oh they talking about me
ugh two bad you don't you don't go to camp sia but that time when I was like red cross in brownies I always had camps right sometimes like when you too tired I don't know whether it's a hallucination or not but I'm pretty sure I'm not because what I'm the kind right once I sleep I like if world war three happens also I wouldn't wake up I will sleep even when a bomb drops ya tidur mati ah ya then like so basically what happened was that I was awake I woke up I was groggy but I was awake I mean I'm blind lah I wear specs lah but I was awake but I saw like something at the end of my bed like standing
I was looking at it okay baca apa kau aku baca pun kena kacau that's why
baca ke tak baca it won't stop me from getting disturbed
is it but then again when you hear about like I see like all the syarahan-syarahan they say actually jin can apa tu manipulate your dreams things like that even when they actually disturb you they can't touch you they can only manipulate your mind right
I think rather than hasutan right if they can insert images in your brain when you're sleep right they can do the same when you are awake what ya so basically it's not exactly hasutan but it's more of because hasutan are words right they play with your mind ya definitely even when you see err like english like like american horror movies or things like that if you realise that most of it is just ya they play with your mind
like because sometimes I don't know some people they say what apa eh iman kuat or semangat kuat or something right then they said that apa tu
oh so since like this person semangat kuat akan disturb so I'm like ya like how my my sister lemah semangat kan so dia kena kacau instead of my father
because my kakak penakut I think no wonder anak dia pun ikut lah pergi toilet pun bushu can you open the light for me mother never open the door please lah how old already you put switch on the light lah your house also it's not like house haunted okay actually ya maybe I don't know also her house maybe haunted because I kena tap before
I was rushing it was her birthday soon so I was like I was like sewing then I was like trying on the feet lah whether it fits well the shoulders are okay I was looking in the mirror then suddenly I felt like a huge like a solid tap on my shoulder you know you can feel the tap you know and I was like I switch I turn the I turn the mirror like around then I was like I never disturb you you don't disturb me ha I want to sleep you don't disturb me and then I I just I I didn't switch off the light I went to my bed I just play the phone the whole night I don't dare the next day I went to sleep with my mum I was so scared I was like oh my god the heck tap me is different you know if it's like just khayal like if it's like uh you mean if it's your imagination right you will feel someone walk behind you or something but this one is not I felt sold tap like someone tapping my shoulder sounds like
ustaz say they cannot show themselves doesn't mean they can't touch you
oh my god have you seen the the penampakan like and the videos and like got one video right I think malaysia or something
I honestly feel that K lah the one that I I I I'm a sceptic lah like you if you post on macam kan dia orang buka dia orang macam tunjuk kan
dia orang nak views kot
I feel like I I believe more those yang macam amateur amateur ones that macam a that one scares me for real like I saw one kan and he was like
waiting for her boyfriend then they were talking talking then her boyfriend go out she go out with her boyfriend then then there's ada show that she was talking talking talking then she U-turn back go back in the room use her phone
then because singapore I feel like singaporeans by that time singapore was modernise malaysia still kampung kot
maybe dia orang tak no it's not that practice no if you realise a lot like like I said my
can I even say this though it's like like my nenek ada saka kan
but then again for malaysia even now there's people who still have saka
I I like it's hard to find people with susuk in singapore LOL they might just as well put fillers kan it's easier to find a doctor than a bloody bomoh ya that's why might as well just put on lip fillers and nose fillers then you go and find bomoh bomoh pun uh wah golden golden apa tu
uh apa tu susuk emas dalam muka saya biar biar awet muda LOL what
so leceh
for susuk or like if you jaga like if you ada saka ke apa kan kena jaga lama seh ha kain kuning lah pulut kuning ayam ayam seekor so apa tu tangga galah tangga tak boleh
I don't know I don't know I don't have susuk I don't have saka buluh kot buluh
eh tak lah payung
I don't know I think buluh has some
I don't know like how you know certain like I said daun or air garam maybe like buluh has some
dia docker ke apa metal
I don't know I mean okay but I mean if it's galah galah galah galah metal kat dalam rumah apa kalau metal kat dalam rumah apa you need to walk under the galah
but why would you walk under the galah when there's clothes dirty water will drip on you anyway
would you walk under the galah if there's like dirty clothes above your head no why would I want underwear water on my hair
I guess but then again if you do susuk probably you won't you will be more aware lah I mean zaman sekarang I wouldn't know lah tengah main handphone alamak jalan bawah galah bodoh apa the heck but ya
kau ingat kau ingat burger ke apa dah terkeluar masuk balik I mean I don't think it's so easy to remove
but I want one thing I'm I'm thinking is that what did they say once it comes out terkeluar right you because ah you become uglier
that's what they say if your your susuk keluar you become buruk
cerita hantu eh
macam botox ah it's just that botox is err it stays inside your skin
I guess so can you imagine your bomoh dies then you're you're you are no lah eh but then
nazak right I think that's I think that's common ah
so you suffer more when you die ah macam saka ah
you cannot die tenteram
they say when they leave you to put inside your kubur apa tu tujuh kaki dalam tujuh kaki wide thing
you still can feel them lowering you down and things like that they can they can feel you kafan you they they can feel them showering you things like that
it's like pakai baju biasa ah eh please lah you haven't die your clothes so thick already you wear so many layers kafan won't kill you it's just one layer you probably
probably you be shivering like alah asal dia orang tak taruk banyak cloth bodoh sejuk siol bajet ke satu layer jer tu lah pasal tapi eh dia orang kafan sampai tu apa
kain kafan all the way apa guess you have stockings
kain batik just to cover your atas jer but your kafan is all white ah
it's just to cover the face so people don't macam stare at you or something it's just macam you okay if like you eat nasi lemak will you eat the wrapper
no you will eat the rice and the chicken and the sayur all what
mayat jijik ah no but there are cases if you know right when allah tak nak terima your death kan then you apa ada the maggots or like ular atau apa tu nanah
it will push you back out or like your kubur will be filled with water things like that then I don't think the family members wanna keep either they just I think they just probably throw it away or like keep it
dia duduk balik is it
they just I I the one that I know is jangan when they say terima tak or whatever ambil beban ke apa don't just just don't say yes there's no respond
biar allah ambil beban
or may allah take your syaitan
during nazak a lot of people pass cause I heard one time
they had to open the bumbung you know zinc kampung right so they use zinc punya bumbung kan so for like when the person tengah nazak kan dia orang buka dia punya bumbung tu biar
kau ingat kau kau ingat convertible ke apa they had to climb and open it lah kau ni bodoh but ya lah they have to open the zinc bumbung then it's like let the
ya if the thing leaves ah because I think I I don't know if you saw yang jangan pandang belakang they they the thing couldn't get out so it's just sticking at the walls climbing and all until the guy terima nenek dia punya benda tu I'm so glad when my grandma never pass to my mum no it's more like the thing doesn't want my mum
because my my my mum cakap the thing
he's recording sia the thing apa tu
I don't know I don't have a I don't have a saka
I don't have a saka I'm a sucker but I don't have a saka you get me but ya it's like um
don't have worldly desires tak tamak tak apa tu tak jahat tak tamak tak jahat uh apa tu
basic willing to help people gitu ah sincere lah so maybe like
it pick my grandma because of that but none of my pakcik makcik and my mum because my mum was definitely money money money my mum wow she went out to work work work work she said she had no life she that she did nothing but just work I ask her what's her hobby it's work
ya because zaman tu right zaman tu perempuan kena cuci rumah and masak
ah cerita cerita apa ah yang the worst witch
it's about this uh kid lah abeh dia ada power but then dia dia macam harry potter tapi it's about females it's witches
quite fun lah to pass time pasal sekarang aku dah tak kerja apa abeh tengah tunggu cari kerja kan so I just watch like whatever I can find lah on netflix then that popped out so I watch it it's not bad got four seasons and each episode macam empat puluh minit gitu
tapi dia orang pun baru pe so that kind of standard pe
abeh sekarang kau masih bayar untuk netflix
berbulan-bulan ya berapa ah dia orang naik harga kan
banyak benda sia naik harga my google drive also naik harga
I haven't seen any updates on it but I know google dah ada
assignment apa sia
I mean it will get better lah I mean yang COVID ni semua bukan like forever what they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better tak tahu ah
tengok ah
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on cari kerja ke start business ke
kau nak buat business apa sia
but ada juga ah macam sikit
abeh kau masih beli benda kat habbo
mm masih spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like jual your benda and quit or
banyak sangat benda kan
not like what if it gets worst macam like dia orang remove banyak benda from the game then orang semua macam tak nak main
I think dia orang macam tak fikir they gonna cause
macam like to them at the end of the day kita like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
macam like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then orang masih beli pe it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
habis smite apa jadi
oh really cause I know that day uh siapa naim asked uh ilyas to join but then ilyas said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
mm four days ago three days ago ya macam
the file got too big for ilyas so like dia tak boleh download then sampai dia have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why ah ilyas dia cakap dengan aku like oh I cannot play with you cause sekarang dia main among us jer
I think baru ah like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but dia cakap dia delete semua benda tinggal yang programme files
like dia basically formatted his ya
dia cakap dulu file dia macam fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu
cause that time dia cakap dia punya app ada issue lah he couldn't log in so dia delete then bila dia nak redownload balik tak boleh
so dia format like remove everything from dia punya lepas tu semua benda like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
that'll be cool though can you imagine yang character character dia semua jadi spongebob punya character macam mister crab sandy
probably go with good looks but I mean pasal kalau
badan sapau pun I mean you can just go to the gym boleh pergi gym boleh pergi like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that tapi kalau nak muka baru I mean you can't really do that also what so probably good looks
ya I guess banyak banyak duit at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like kalau nak like make yourself fitter and stuff boleh pergi lari and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
I mean to a certain extent semua orang pun macam at least a bit ah
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff lah kalau tak then there's really like no point
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but kalau
kalau ni hari not much lah I'm just going to go home and like rest but like kalau esok maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang haven't dah lama belum potong rambut so maybe I shall do that
rasa macam free kan
sekarang muka macam maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short macam medium length gitu lah tak nak panjang sangat pun
kalau kat rumah hmm
netflix lepas tu
main and playing a bit of
apa lagi ah
uh no I haven't played cause like I don't know macam
main dengan naim and muhammad they very competitive and then like if ilyas is not there like can't really
so I usually kalau dia orang dua jer then I I avoid
but like kalau the rest main then aku main ah cause I
I mean the same thing happened bila that time I tried to download kat my macbook apa
cause I don't think they have a punya file
oh ya kalau satu benda dapat rumah ah
I mean kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah then at most kau kerja untuk
maybe your savings and then like sikit untuk makan minum bills
we move to an island yang tak ada orang
uh pergi ah
so what the cow is the hantu or like
maybe orang maybe like someone like dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa
the latest the one I think just got removed what the kampung
I don't know buangkok some some no as in like an actual kampung macam
uh orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu ya
yang that time I went there untuk yang satu filming for this
cerita hantu ah
ya went there and then dia orang cakap uh tempat tu memang ada benda ah like there's there's actual hantu living there ya
and then like there's this one makcik ah like this chinese auntie
abeh dia orang cakap macam um like kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam have like
good intentions like you can't be there to macam
she said like kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur lah just let it be
we film from I think like we arrived there at six ah so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the hantu was late
and then we had to delay and then wait then um when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her punya costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the hantu it was quite quite interesting to see her change ah cause
dia ah she's like I think some
abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu and then it's kind of fun lah but macam
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal yang kecil punya contact lenses it's a full eye one
we were kind of worried lah that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god lah like nasib ah
benda tu jadi so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary ah to see her in the dark
ya lah but then it's the only kampung I know that exists in singapore lah
that kampung
they are very nice and then the when we were there kita nampak macam uh tiga caucasian people ang moh like white people
they were like dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok ah then dia orang nampak then kita punya filming punya benda then dia macam oh what you're doing
they like oh okay cool cool and jalan
quite a few like um there's a lot of kampung houses lah but macam maybe ada lima ke enam orang jer tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang ah
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that kampung
so macam she does the upkeeping and stuff ah and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
like ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
ya it's very close it's like macam kalau
dia like here and then it's just kat bawah
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the kampung area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
besar juga ah like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks gitu
it's all kayu and then like very old school lah semua macam
stay in the kampung
ya it's quite gelap I mean there there is a few street lights ah like around the area but it's quite dark and then um
tempat dia memang besar like really quite big ya
like explore like one small corner of it cause bila kita masuk kita naik lorry kena bawa semua equipment kan so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
aku datang just tengok-tengok abeh like macam tolong sini tolong sana
ya dah pukul lapan gitu then she came over
then she was like kau orang nampak apa-apa tak and I'm like um no and then she said like kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut nothing one
dia hantu baik then I'm like okay
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will tunggu malam baru keluar cause panas sangat like everyday it's so humid and hot
tiga tahun eh it's quite recent sia
but like kesian juga ah like you when you tengok the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
I want go yang tempat apa tu yang dekat gardens by the bay ah
pergi satu kali ah when in maybe secondary school
tiga wish
oo okay lah kalau dia orang nak kasih free ambil jer lah kalau kalau bayar then okay ah aku bingit but then kalau free
then collect dekat dekat rumah aku okay lah and
I mean ya memang ah like buang masa juga cause
they tell you like oh you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing abeh it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
but I don't think macam
kat bawah block
huh sini takde banyak kucing
only got lembu
have you seen your cat luar
seram sia
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad lah macam
hmm bila like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
abeh batuk rabak sia it's like cannot breathe and stuff
sekarang if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy ah like if he comes too close like my face
and then kalau when I mandi him like
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to macam pursue technology
the president speaks in malay kau orang semua stop it eh
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi I just I just want to give you a warning eh kau stop jer eh jangan buat lagi tau
then okay kau balik like

err eh is it ah ah ke dalam pukul dua gitu gitu check-in
eh tak lah wah we play mm wah that was the first time my layang-layang flied so high eh it was like wow
think we checked-in then we what did we have ah I cannot remember apa kita makan kat sana I think oh you know before that right kita pergi Arab Street makan dekat this place near Masjid Sultan
I think it's called err ape minang kah ape I can't remember the name
like um the minang err the cuisine name
no eh it was cheap like it was considered macam atas street food
but wah the food was so good until now I'm thinking about dia punya tahu telur wah sedap oof
yeah then we wah we nasib baik ah kita dapat err swimming slot for both for all three days
oh tu tak tau but I know they have like satu jam punya slot habis tu thirty minutes for cleaning
oh no no like we boleh masuk untuk satu jam habis tu before the next slot they will clean for thirty minutes then there is a next slot
yeah we lucky lah cause some people tak dapat so yeah
err oh the last day kita pergi right we went at err I think lapan setengah pagi habis tu hujan
tak ah mandi aja lah
sejuk ah
no err hari kedua we went to ape tu Garden By The Bay
yeah masuk dalam
okay lah I will lagi
tak eh cause they limit the occupancy
and I'm like wah tak banyak orang
uh tu pun pergi boring seh pergi banyak kali
err cause is like if not for this situation kita pun tak pergi nya cause mahal seh on normal days
I think around there kat sana tu
wanted to have like graduation staycay also tak dapat seh
uh tak dapat reply nak buat ape
wah actually dia punya shift panjang seh
belum the result only coming out err bulan depan there yeah
yeah my siblings say I'm a bum a home bum so I'm like okay tu pun jadi lah
yeah I mean some of the requirements also I don't meet lah macam what ada kan diploma lah atau experience lah then I'm like I don't have any
uh I'm like it require three months aku tiga bulan dah start sekolah ape kalau gitu
eh I play with me I will download it and then boleh main sama-sama
I don't I I err boleh boleh tanya orang lain
oh err ada lah or
ya because they tengok a lot of TikTok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny I like I want to try nak cuba
oh my god it's like okay so I watched his TikTok of the like they play Among Us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's David he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press dia punya butang after that he hide the body behind him
mm betul wah I miss playing night games with people
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small UNO atau Among Us then I'm like
err all meat but I can still eat daging lembu yes
yeah because daging lembu selalu macam they have this smell
yeah yeah and then tak boleh tahan it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then I always make a big fuss right I hate the smell
I mean tak boleh predict pe so
yeah especially since err nanti the fish will macam bau ja hanyir so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
nak but then
bila nak pergi what's the plan
twenty eight agak near lah kena check again
okay yeah my poly friends also dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke they all already start uni
tak sekolah lain-lain seh
entah lah dia orang nak jumpa makan lah nak jumpa belajar then I'm like kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama
yeah then macam guys move on
that's why then I macam aiya whatever lah it's up to them then next week ah minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa then they were like oh kita tunggu untuk Carea to like give when she free to meet then I'm like
yeah then eh I just open the chat habis tu I kan I just say mm err you guys go ahead I'm not free
then the makanan they all want to eat also selalu dia orang nak minta makanan I tak boleh makan
yeah cause dengan our secondary school friends kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu pe selalu it's very easy for us to settle food what
yeah then is don't know lah is that time like I think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like oh let's eat Umisushi then okay aku tak boleh makan
yeah it's like oh let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama
yeah I understand it's it's like when you meet dengan dia orang it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like penat seh why did I go out I regret going out of the house
boleh experiment then you see mana satu lagi murah
uh yeah aigoo dah lah tak ada kerja habis tu bus fare pun mahal hais
oh I was so confused by it I I didn't do the survey dia punya yeah
yeah I mean it's very different perspective of problems lah like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible punya bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
cause even for like macam orang yang tak boleh nampak like visual disability they have new apps macam the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
cause even for my school cause Ngee An kan ada that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability pun I there was this period of time I had like macam class right then every time if I reach school dekat this certain timing I will see that makcik that cannot see then I will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
oh forest no tak dengar eh
wah was the forest fire macam bad
oh my gosh why apa gunanya gender reveal seriously
it's macam
pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
I guess maybe we have different values like untuk kita if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
wah ah speaking of Kelly and her mum the cake that she mm baked untuk your birthday wah I still think of it sometimes
yeah cause I mean I think the cake macam dry because dah simpan satu hari pe dah potong then you give it to them the next day but wah the whipped cream I was so amazed cause selalu whipped cream kan diorang buat cake is either macam banyak sangat then too sweet or like the whipping cream macam how to say ya macam berminyak is that the word like
yeah don't cause you messaged me habis tu you messaged dengan orang lain kan and we were like err dia tak kan beli cake kan like err err err
that's why when you asked me kalau nak cake then I like I like cake but kalau aku bilang aku nak cake nanti kau beli macam mana
no she panic cause yang when you were working together yang ada satu hari ni then after that kita send message then you pakai dia punya handphone kan then dia eh guys Nisha pakai aku punya handphone then we were like oh did she see the chat
yeah then we ni we panic right then kita tukar dia punya group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
yeah eh I can pinjam you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one kena bayar
it's it's super hilarious macam you you boleh nampak their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
err sekarang dah ada empat if you want to include macam behind the scenes ada lapan in total
no no I was talking about the merchandise yeah right the cawan was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got cawan I was like
is is like your cup nya design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
right it's ugh and it's not very like macam merchandise is you
wah you know the only time yang diorang letak diorang punya muka right the I think is the merchandise I was like nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas
mm I see so many Youtube videos of people like they are not fans but their room is covered in punya bantal</malay lah dia punya soft toy then I like
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the chibi the tiny Tan oh my god oh I wanted to get their things and then after that aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya shipping fee then I'm like
dia punya shipping macam boleh beli tiga dia punya product tau I was like ugh
yeah that's why when I renew my membership right the membership kit is like twenty then after that I checked out right dia punya shipping the whole price went up to seventy then I like
oh no no no that one change already cause that one is diorang punya old style
you want to level up untuk dapat lebih banyak benda you must do the quiz and fill up the test
tak dia this one is more like accessible I guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
tapi bodoh lah just tak you spend like ape thirty dollars just to kacau orang on the website
well nak beli this macam sweater it's a knitted sweater lah then I also looking at this skirt
yeah err I think the skirt dalam dua belas dollar gitu
tak it's just I want to save up the money first
because the shipping is only macam dalam dua tiga dollar gitu aje not much
yeah cause macam it's not really like ethical I don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse punya factory lah so yeah
dah boleh off
okay ah jadi in january
I aku tanya untuk early check in
aku kena jumpa kau pukul tiga kat bugis
mail confirmed datang ke tak
kita jumpa dia orang somewhere
then bila kita dah jumpa dia orang then baru kita macam
cari tempat makan ah I mean
I don't know aku tak tahu macam kau orang nak buat whether kau orang nak order from app sendiri sendiri atau kau orang nak beli then bring back
betul juga ah
boleh ah
tapi tu lah aku pun macam
untuk confirm
err actually semua belum confirm
it's err dayah actually dah confirm tapi pasal anak dia
kalau pasal anak dia jadi dia macam to be confirmed
kita macam so far so good lah kan
for dayah confirmed pasal man fetch dia then man datang ambil hantar
kira K the thing is dayah man akan ambil anak-anak dayah then ambil dia then hantar dia supposedly that was what I had in my head but dia cakap
oh anak aku pun datang abeh dia cakap aku tak biasa orang lain jaga anak aku so aku macam
macam you know that feeling ah macam
boleh lah tapi also mai mai pun pasal dia
tak sekolah apa I mean dia kerja kat sekolah
but part time but then at the same time pasal on the four baru buka we are going on the eight
ah eight nine apa we go on the eight so aku tak tahu macam mana how she will juggle it
like kerja
dengan kita ah but
I know that all of them nak join definitely like siapa yang tak nak budak primary school
problem tak I mean also at the same time beacause I did personally ask them
whether okay ke tak
macam abeh dia orang semua macam excited okay
then the anak thing
the anak thing came up then after everything is like
okay semua orang macam
tengok lah macam mana
I mean aku don't mind I I mean really
betul betul eh aku really don't mind tau kalau dia bawa anak dia
but it's attitude anak dia yang buat aku macam
tu yang buat aku marah gila tau bila the first time aku nampak that kind of attitude and she even say um dah dah ada rumah dah pindah semua perangai tak nak dengar kata aku
dia macam cakap out loud tau macam you know how mothers are like ah aku seorang kat rumah ni
ah aku seorang jer kemas orang lain ah macam gitu dia macam rant
why suddenly the change then dia macam aku pun tak tahu ah semua orang macam perangai
you know you are expecting guests you you already have guests yesterday abeh ini hari aku dengan cousin man datang
to your child and ask macam
kau okay tak
why are you behaving like this abeh macam dia
aku tak tahu ah like really aku aku tak nak malukan dia
aku tak nak dia kita malukan dia like
so aku macam you know
as fake as it is ah aku macam nak try everything to go smoothly tau aku tak nak nanti macam
I mean this will happen ah orang macam
why I come here oi kau eh kau duduk eh alamak standard mothers I I expect that even wati is like
aku tak tahu whether aku bawa anak aku pasal nanti aku tarzan and anak dia perempuan
kau tak tutup pintu eh tadi
okay I take the fault so mojo boleh keluar tak
takde dia nak tengok muka aku juga macam gitu gasak lah kau
okay but apa
so I was thinking aku fikir kan nak macam if we're getting together aku nak order mango tart
dari kawan aku lah but she say she can for weekday she can only do delivery seven thirty onwards
then aku macam okay ah I don't mind
then but at the same time bugis banyak dessert though
dia banyak dessert
so aku macam is it worth it ordering from my friend
err siapa
dia kahwin dia kahwin dah pregnant dah ada anak then she was like posting about anak dia then after that stopped
like anak dia
kan macam out of the blue stopped so aku pun macam oh okay lah
sebab tu lah
dia okay ke tak
that's that's why bila aku tanya dia kan aku macam mm should I ask should I ask
pasal aku tak tahu whether
she is into getting together with us meeting up with us ke tak
aku nak tutup aku tutup pintu jap just in case mister mojo masuk
eh busy kau
kau dah bilang dia lah
oh nanti lah aku tengok aku check kan kalau ada lagi ni pun aku nampak kat facebook lah sia
aku nampak tapi aku macam okay I sent in my interest then dia get back to aku then dia cakap but actually boleh send anytime
actually boleh send anytime
then aku macam tengok lah macam mana pasal err dia cakap slots are filling up fast
so aku cakap dengan dia aku boleh buat on friday which is dengan kau lah there is no way I'm doing with someone else
cause abeh dia cakap pun dia boleh dapatkan orang
tak nak aku I'm not I'm not in school to do that
aku pun aku zoom sekali jer
sekali jer
kau insurance apa ah
ada rider
no ride rider means it's an extra premium jadi kau boleh dapat macam
um that is a um macam
macam mana eh nak cakap kau boleh
kira kan
private hospital macam hospital aku
ya but it's still macam subject to approval ah
but insurance kau kau dapat bila
so shouldn't be a but it's not a pre existing condition apa
two thousand fourteen kira lepas kau kahwin baru ada insurance
oh before asal kau tak ambil rider sekali
recently aku check untuk siapa si
ah dia ada rider anak dia ada rider just anak bongsu dia takde
but maybe it might be some aku can check lah what is your
ya I know it's shield something aku tak ingat ah nama dia
the words juga
kan macam ah is healthshield gold max A then there is also gold max B
ah A paling tinggi B macam down ah
kalau kau boleh check
I mean you can always ask lah bcause sometimes a lot of banyak orang kan kat kerja aku bila aku buat dia orang punya how to say ah
banyak anak seh tak tahu mak bapa dia orang punya insurance apa
macam ah I'll ask your parents got insurance
oh I don't know I don't know semua kau tak tahu apa yang kau tahu
macam these kind of things especially mak bapa kau dah tua
then aku macam
apa yang kau bayar untuk insurance macam kalau let's say ah the basic ah is medishield then kalau kau upgrade and then it will be depend on which company you take ah your prushield
then kalau tak upgrade baru kau tahu but then bila kau upgrade poly kau nak kena tahu whether kau punya is
atas atau somewhere in between macam parents aku punya is just one step below which is B plus is the
rider plan A plus is like not basic ah but it's there so macam
like dia orang kalau pergi private eh so kira macam emergency dia orang kena pergi private they have to pay upfront first
then reimbursement ah so that's why aku selalu cakap dengan members members eh
kau orang muda kau orang boleh afford it why not
memang betul lah kau macam kau tengok macam payah kau nak bayar
yearly kau bayar berapa when you count
macam kau even it out for twelve months
it's sikit seh it's like forty dollars fifty dollars unless you pay like over thousand over dollars ah then
TAQWA apa seh
itu apa islamic punya apa
tapi kan
asal hospital aku takde
pasal I mean
prudential aviva so ni empat jer tau most probably kalau ah qing were to come right she will have to pay first then reimburse
ya so that's how it is lah macam dia dapat refund balik ah kalau
kita boleh try to get electronic letter of guarantee which mean that without deposit so means kau tak payah bayar upfront
ah ah because that's why unless you don't I mean that's why I asked you whether kau private ke
private atau government for your future baby
oh okay lah government you don't have to worry macam kawan aku zahirah
three K dia keluar cash money
aku rasa they have a very big subsidiary for future mums
ah because they menggalakkan untuk kau mengadakan baby dan breastfeed
ya they they are really big on that seh they will get dia sampai dapat apa tu nursing
like if the baby doesn't latch on then dia cakap okay you try this you try that
but tapi bayar lah
oh that time kakak ipar aku punya tak seh
eva tak seh
tak tau pasal dia nak compete dengan private banyak orang pergi private because of that but at the same time people go to private because it's much more efficient much more faster
because of lesser clientele macam zahirah punya kakak ipar
she was like oh aku tak datang period
that time dia pergi hospital dia macam okay this is my err
macam oh I already have two kids I should be okay pergi then dia cakap oh you have a mass
macam a cyst a cyst a tumour or whatever need to remove so dia macam hati tak sedap dia pergi doctor aziz
dia orang ultrasound ah that's why tu pasal dia macam okay whatever I just spend a bit more money just for private
and anak dia semua doctor aziz
this doctor aziz apparently ada berapa sebelas anak
that's what I heard dari makcik aku pasal makcik aku ni ah pun doctor aziz juga
for bidan punya type ah for a gynaecologist tapi aku macam
sebelas sia ramai sia tu anak
tu pasal but dia orang cakap anak dia paling kecil is quite young
I don't know maybe dia masih nak kena tanggung for sekolah
oh pasal oh pasal kau
but takkan lah dia orang takde macam one certain doctor with your condition like this
but aku macam aku pun nak tengok gynae actually aku I I only have one month left sia for me to check for pap smear under my
uh kerjanya insurance
but aku nak kena pergi A&E nak kena dia orang check then after that you need to give some
bedek bedek then in order for you to see a gynae then after that tell them to give me pap smear
ah terus aku macam huh because if kalau aku pergi straight aku kena bayar out of pocket aku tak boleh pakai kerja punya insurance so aku macam mm
is it worth the ten the fifteen dollars pasal five dollars A&E ten dollars specialist
eh abeh nanti the baby macam mana ni
aku kena tolak tepi alah tak kisah pun
macam tak biasa you tahu kan semua alah aku pregnant
dua pregnant semua dah jadi mak
tak aku pun tanya no like aku pun macam
because it's been quite a while apa
ah kau dah ada eh
oh baru juga lah
wow kau punya
tu pasal lah because I know that they said when people go for radiation and this
a that's why banyak cancer male ah they freeze their sperm
ah just for future ah just in case dia orang nak anak then
then aku macam
mahal eh recently there was this guy I don't know what he did sperm extraction
tapi dia punya procedure dah dia dah
kerek procedure dia punya lah panjang mahal nak mampus sia
ah ah patient patient patientnya dia um
abeh macam angmoh
uh dia dia punya wife cina ah ah seh
kerek kerek gila terus aku macam aku tengok then I googled what was because whenever they give us
it's scientific apa
so aku google scientific word ni
rupanya it's sperm extraction for freezing eh hello umur dah berapa tak payah nak ada anak-anak ni semua macam abeh and also because dia orang dia cakap kat situ diagnosis low sperm count
low sperm count apa maknanya makna kau tak sepatutnya ada anak setan
I would I just want to know how much is the price that's all you don't have to you don't have to explain to me anything else diam ah sia
tapi kalau no the thing is kalau kita tak explain
macam dia tak cakap apa-apa aku tak tahu dia tak cakap ah abeh last last kena kat aku ah kepala otak dia
ya I'm there's a lot of times ah orang datang kat kita why is the doctor's charges so high
aiya I don't want to pay kau punya pasal ah kau tak nak bayar sudah
entah ah dah aku kena call sana call sini abeh last last clinic macam
ah abeh aku macam okay then you speak to the you speak to the patient ah
haiya this one okay okay okay okay eh kau tak happy aku tak happy semua tak happy siapa yang happy
bodoh abeh mana aku nak dapat duit aku kalau patient ni kalau patient ni tak bayar

abeh bila member dia cakap macam gitu dia macam okay pergi kat bomoh
abeh bomoh tu cakap kau nak anak kau hidup balik boleh tapi aku nak kena sacrifice lagi satu anak bodoh kan so aku macam abeh bila aku tengah tengok kau nak tahu apa dalam otak aku
agaknya anak dia kena sacrifice untuk orang lain punya anak so aku macam

pasal err
dia orang try to ikat
aku tak tahu police ni datang dari mana pasal tak ada orang call police entah entah police ada
kan macam
police ni datang dari mana ni
takde orang call kau seh pasal it's mak bapa dia jer dengan budak tu abeh budak tu bunuh bapak dia pasal dah
a'ah dia bapa dia abeh bini dia the mama pukul dah dia cakap muka dia dah berubah semua mak dia pukul sekali mak dia

then afterwards sekali dah dah nak ikat
mati ah
abeh mak dia kena masuk jail kena duduk kat jail sia
kesian siol
ah aku tak faham asal orang macam gini like there's some people who really like macam so obsessed over
anak dia to a point that dia sanggup buat macam gini kau faham tak budak tu pun kena culik
aku tak pernah tengok sia tu
and it's lepas tu second rider pergi kat sana balik dah orang lain kan
tapi kan bila dia cakap macam gitu ada darah semua teringat aku pasal steven lim
ah adrian lim kesian seh
tak ah
tapi bila aku baca aku macam confused
pasal dia ambil budak tu dari clementi seh
aku tak tahu budak tu tinggal mana tapi dia pergi clementi untuk dengan makcik dia macam main-main kat bawah block
then entah entah dia kena bunuh kat toa payoh jauh tu
tapi yang ada lagi satu victim tu yang dia dapat lari eh oh tak it's a budak melayu tu kan yang dapat lari eh
ni aku sikit hari apa ah few years back ah abang aku tanya aku
ah googlekan adrian lim terus macam
kau ada smartphone apa
tapi internet dulu kan berapa ah
so aku macam oh okay I google for you abeh dia cakap block apa ah block ni ni ni aku tak ingat aku tak ingat block apa ah terus aku macam
why you want to know no why you find hantu ah
then macam tak ah okay lor okay lor
but nowadays macam banyak cerita hantu hantu
but tu dia sacrifice ah
tapi kau tengok ah muka dia macam babi sia
tapi kau dah tengok kau dah baca a son of peach punya yang
aku that time aku baca then tak tahu macam mana mona fandey boleh masuk
mona fandey punya stories pun boleh masuk juga terus aku macam
dia orang cakap mona fandey ni apa uh
err oh lately dia punya kawan perempuan err did something for drugs ah dekat malaysia abeh dia kena gantung tapi sebelum dia kena gantung dia duduk dekat mona fandey punya cell lama
every night dia kena kacau
abeh ada orang macam come to defense ah cakap oh dia macam dia kena fitnah seh
dia kena fitnah pasal dia sembahyang lima waktu then son of peach cakap kau fikir kau jaga barang ni semua tak senang ke of course kau nak kena sembahyang lima waktu seh kalau tak benda ni makan kau
ah so that's why you want like keep your iman
strong at the same time you want to practise all these terus aku macam
ah jadi dia
tak macam selama ni dia tahu macam black magic ni kau pun nak kena sembahyang lima waktu jadi benda-benda ni semua tak kacau kau
tapi at the same time kan aku tak rasa dia ada black magic
that ilmu kebal
aku tak tahu lah macam dia punya intention to just pakai duit sidek ni
pakai duit yang siapa ni yang mati ni then bila dia bunuh then dia just pakai jer pasal she had no intention of covering it up apa
so aku rasa macam maybe the intention is just to buat pakai duit ni bunuh
then on the disguise of ada ilmu kebal
mm but at the same time dia ada practice dia macam small time small time jer lah tapi
macam orang yang kat quaters dekat
malaysia punya
aku macam oh my god oh my god
abeh bila aku kerja kat kan aku punya colleague cakap apa tau eh kau tahu mona fandey oh tahu tahu asal asal kau nampak dia aku nampak satu makcik ni macam dia pakai kebaya semua
ah kau tahu bila dia pergi court kan dia pakai kebaya dia cakap ah makcik ni macam dia dekat harbourfront terus aku cakap mona fandey dah sampai singapore
apa ni mona fandey sampai singapore
imagine sekali satu hari kau pass by kau nampak mona fandey
oh atau orang macam mona fandey aku pekik lah sial
tu lah tapi
kan ah dia orang cakap yang kat quarters ni dia orang cakap ah dia macam selalu asal cepat sangat asal cepat sangat macam from three to six dia orang akan nampak
pasal dia nak kena gantung lepas subuh apa so dia macam alamak asal cepat sangat ni dia cakap jangan cepat sangat lah tu macam ee seramnya aku
tapi siapa yang duduk cell dia akan kena gantung
ah pasal aku rasa cell dia it's just for those yang akan kena gantung nanti aku macam mm and recently kakak ipar aku pun macam dia kakak ipar aku sekolah kan
so dia tanya
sometimes people who banyak orang kena gantung
macam pasal singapore punya amount for hanging is quite high
eh it's quite low kalau macam kau five gram jer kau dah boleh kena gantung padahal tu five gram is cukup untuk kau pakai sendiri then aku macam
banyak melayu kena gantung seh yang kena gantung melayu
mostly malays yang si cina ni semua dapat
so aku macam it's it's already like lah where
apa heavy
tapi kakak kakak ipar aku pun berbual pasal dia kerja kat dalam kan dia pun ada cakap kau tengok ah yang si cina-cina ni semua blue collar sia eh cina-cina semua white collar crime crimes sia and duit dia orang banyak-banyak kau orang punya duit sikit-sikit duduk berapa lama
kakak ipar aku cakap think of it ah look at it
and also dia pun tak tahu ah macam how she feels about the death penalty I mean kalau betul-betul pada aku macam orang yang patut kena bunuh is rapist kena hang ni yang rapists child molesters they should be hanged but apparently dia orang kena serve time then after that they come out mana boleh
pada aku rotan tak cukup sia bro
ah rotan dua empat kali pun tak cukup
atau jadikan subject of experiments
but there's human rights lah so aku macam whatever lah this people are not humans
entah because I think dulu kan dia orang fikir macam the drugs can ruin our children our future
that was their thinking lah so aku macam
ni semua sia dia orang patut they should actually look into it seh
drugs but I'm like pada aku macam
kau sedar macam it's like
a human life memang betul lah both of them play with human lives but then
kau kentut eh
these rape victims may not be macam

then aku macam
about the human life who have ruined another human like a lot of these drug not drug traffickers I'm not saying about drug traffickers lah banyak dia orang makan sendiri like they use it for their own consumption they are not selling

semua orang sia aku tak tahu bila abang aku masuk pun kita semua macam kita adik-beradik macam tahu lah
but that one point of time bila dia gaduh dengan fizah tu part yang dia kena angkat terus
whatever tu pasal aku cakap maybe right maybe he's a drug user that's why you cannot

tapi a'ah seh aku jumpa dia macam aww dia still putih tinggi the same shit he looks better now
he's six years older than me terus aku dia macam oh you want to exchange no
aku tak nak contact dengan dia
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
I'm going to be wearing this nonya kebaya lah it's pink and it's gold
tapi bawah dia actually is kain daripada indonesia dia javanese punya batik ah
tak lah kawan aku cakap dia beli murah jer kat indonesia she said you can get like cheaper things in indonesia macam kalau kau nak buat kebaya-kebaya semua just buat kat sana
no kita just
kita just kena pretend ah macam this conversation ah kita boleh tukar-tukar background kau nak pergi paris kita boleh tukar pergi paris
boleh lah kita just tukar nama dia orang as A dengan B
habis begitu jer ah
kau kan gemini moon
bila aku single
sekarang aku tak boleh tak boleh gila-gila sangat doh
oh my god did I tell you ex aku tulis surat kat aku lagi
aku delete ah lepas tu aku deleted the the surat
I got the notification ah so out of curiosity I went to go and read it then when I read it I'm like eh aku seriously just eh
aku tak sabar nak makan nasi pengantin on sunday
a'ah because kawan aku ni like she she nikah already in september
not very practical so she decided to do her sanding on sunday but that is her side then her husband side is going to do the sanding next month

aku just malas like what is the point of you telling me this ah like
kau just boleh ah like pretend that nothing happened like
bila kau beli rokok dia orang tak minta ke
bodoh nak jer cuci mata dia ni
that's all and then the next the next message he sent me was I think like two days ago and he said like hey I know this is weird but can I ask you for a favour then aku macam seram sejuk tau aku macam what favour sia this fellow want to ask
ya like now apa they don't even play music there
only now because now all the social distancing people like go there and like check like if you want to lepak at the beach also
so like when he tell me he want to like ask me for this favour like a part of me was like a a little bit like macam
vindicative so I was like sure even if you get the place kat dalam otak aku ah aku fikir you want to get the place tutup mm it not gonna be fun ya
makan cake

like a kid like he hold out the hand habis badan aku kat atas tangan dia and even then I was freaking out I was like no cannot then he was like babe why are you scared my hands are right here how are we going to travel ha and then go swimming and all these nice places I'm like um I'll I'll swim in the shallow waters
bodoh kau hiccups
we are going to entah
I also cannot like panas sial only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile I will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because I know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but I will wake up to him cuddling
it is only when I'm very tired like most of the time right I wake up but then then I see okay lah he already wake up he cause I know he always wake up very early then I say okay katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun kan but I cannot like the bed very comfortable lah then I just go back to sleep
so sometimes I wake up then I turun bawah already cause he's doing work right then I see breakfast dah ada
the drunk we know like our kind of men do it like the my the way my ex used to get drunk not like that like he can still function you can still talk he can still like get dressed mandi take out his clothes and stuff and all that lah so
then he was okay he he still can layan okay ten thirty aku tak bangun kadang-kadang I will wake up early I'll wake up at eight but then ah because I wake up too early right then I tell myself okay lah my alarm ten thirty uh no my alarm at nine thirty so I can still sleep I still got one hour of sleep right that one hour of sleep become two hours sleep lah bloody hell then when I wake up it will be always like after ten thirty then I see my message he already
ya see so so it's not that there is nothing to do it's because kau orang pemalas
I wake up to him waking me up because he buy back lunch he walked back from his office and he got lunch for the both of us then he makan lunch already he go back to office
with andre I'm thinking whether I should get him a batik shirt ah to match me but kedai mana ada jual sekarang
pukul berapa dia orang buka dia orang buka tak saturday

cause afternoon we're going to town to go robinsons or tangs I think and then I was thinking okay by the time kita habis we will probably be eating dinner
and then we will go to town so I won't have time to go and bring him there then I was thinking kalau dia orang buka pagi then I can go and buy first
and then harap-harap ah dia boleh muat
because I don't think he got I don't think he got I don't think he got baju that will match that colour dia ada baju yang boleh match ni
he will eat lah he will eat he he he likes food in general babe dia tak picky when it comes to makan dia tak picky like even when you spicy like deepavali aku bawa bawa balik apa lauk-pauk

ah no ya but from from the way the question they ask she ask like macam ni ah they're kind of expected right
and some more it's like a prime macam
because the second level is the turun barang punya kan then tangga naik atas then I think they have posted they posted some photos also of their office I think their office macam
I don't know because I saw just now you saw or not dia punya story

aku tengok lah kalau aku bawa motosikal ke tidak okay kalau bawa aku ambil kau
I know little should be near little india punya station
what else I was thinking like bring like um sportswear macam I want to go to the gym
feeling jer aku eh I think so like usually
oh okay I will Google aku dah macam wah ni kalau nak maximise apa lagi aku boleh ni eh buat kat hotel ni selain swimming
weh carpet buat apa
kita kena fikir tau tiga orang nak tidur kita kena tidur macam gini melintang
aku rasa ah
aku rasa ah tak nak lah extra bedding tak payah lah untuk satu malam jer
kau takde kau benda-benda gini kan ada
abang kau lagi lah
aku rasa macam abang aku ada nanti aku tengok eh kalau ada
tapi sleeping bag eh tapi kita tiga orang aku rasa aku minta
tak okay katil
that was you you are being told to sleep there kita takkan suruh kau tidur situ the three of us sleep on the bed but if let's say the bed is a king besar right then we
we tidur macam
macam mana uh kita tidur melintang
means kita tak kita tak tak ikut cara
boleh eh aku pernah buat aku nenek aku dan kakak aku pergi holiday kita
kau jangan aku tak suruh kau tidur dekat bench aiyo
a'ah betul tak payah fikir banyak-banyak eh
actually aku tak tahu kau cakap apa tadi aku cakap jer
tapi tapi tu kau kena bawa as in the hassle is we have to be
okay I I think you can get at nanti aku tag but I don't know when I'm going
maybe Daiso punya is for
oh because I know that it the trend is macam you know like like baru-baru ni ah orang baru nak cycling
ni pasal ah
okay lah ini semua pasal COVID lah orang semua
cari cari apa kegiatan eh
kegiatan eh
ah riadah seh
eh uh apa tu ah next year ah we do something
actually I'm supposed to go out just now to collect something then I tell the person can I come tomorrow instead cause like I saw the it's scorching hot then I was like ah apa aku boleh buat productive hari ni okay kemas bilik
tak sweater lah this is this is not sweater this is
no it's tak tebal it is tak tebal
like that thing anak luar nikah jer
no like okay maybe they got married at eighteen pasal ada anak
wow there's a lot of way way sia macam
okay dalam segi agama I would say okay like really just wise like follow your religious maybe it's a good thing lah like just to settle down like err apa to prevent like any sins or any like um what does it call
no no mm haram and thing and like macam um uh what is it macam the bad like people won't talk bad about you what does that thing call
so macam apa ya
honestly no ah because like nanti macam ingat kau macam main main
like you think what this one main main is it like you what your girlfriend you break up patch back patch back merepek what
ya so like I think okay maybe eighteen is a legal age but no I think that's like marriage like maybe that's too young but unless like how to say like ah I've heard lah stories macam aku nampak yang they got married at seventeen or sixteen ya islam
that's the thing I don't know is it in singapore or malaysia ah malaysia ku entah leh maybe it's normal maybe is not lah but like they say like you know then I see and the thing is the best part is that both parents like err what is restu
ah ah they give restu ah they give I the blessing ah dorang kasih blessing dorang
then it's like wow like that's I think that's takes a lot of courage ah for parents nak kasih restu like to cover him at the young age but then we don't know what the reason the actual reason behind lah kan
now the only thing I can think of when you say young marriage is like maybe they did something or maybe they just like tak sabar
they just want to like so macam like oh
if I get married oh you know everything will be like halal you know macam ni ni ni ni like actually ah he's the one or like you know what I don't know how to explain but like macam
so if later macam if it's just reflects to the people and there's like oh kau tengah stereotype just because I'm young
for me ah okay ah kalau kau tanya aku persendirian aku tak tahu ah because like I think I I really believe yang macam apa ya love does not apa ya time does not define love ke love does not define time ada kat that thing ah
like kalau kau jatuh cinta kalau kau like you and then you feel like he's the one he's the one ah because like I heard stories like my apa apanya cikgu
she was in a relationship ever since like in secondary school sampai ke tua like twenty six like that she was schooling my school like she was ready she was asking to marriage but then guy still wanted to play around
like macam he he wasn't serious he still don't want to get married
no no not not the other chicks lah like macam he's just not ready for marriage dia tak dia tak belum fikir kan lah okay for my cikgu kan she's like okay let's say lepak ah ya
okay the guy likes to lepak jam beberapa jam ke dua tiga pagi tau just lepak bawa blok berbual-bual rokok tu semua right my teacher is like by eleven is like eh aku tak penat jah like I want to go home I want to sleep like so like that ya so macam they they I think it's like eight years' relationship
ya ya they call it off they dia orang tak tunang pun ya they broke up she broke up with him and then after that err kak got to know
find new people think she dated one I think like less than a year and I saw she tunang and then after that a year after that she got married ya ya
ya that's the thing like actually I was shocked that she she like she was okay lah maybe dia ada rasa sedih lah I mean siapa tak rasa sedih kan kalau break up
but she's like you know what this is not what I want like like she knows what she wants tu aku yang jawab aku respect kau ah
you really follow me ah eh kalau ikutkan hati aku
I mean like I've been single for the longest time for so macam like
you know you just gonna get any guy then kalau like kau okay aku okay kita go ah sia
but then it's like okay let's say kau
kau dengan my dear kau berapa lama
boleh but then you think your parents will agree
oh tak boleh sambung uh huh
ya I think I've heard stories like they they they just like marry by paper but they still macam go on lah macam I think they are like schooling or something macam let's say kes kalau ni ah
from there ah then masuk like okay lah slowly perlahan perlahan kayuh ah
society nya sekarang now is like I think apa ever since okay let's say our generation ah eh like okay let's say my after our parents' generation like maybe the like early nineties or like the late eighties all of them run dusted the career minded path semua yang tak nak kahwin pun
mm like angkat kaki hurry I already late for work
and then lepas tu macam like complain bila jam
eh amboi
oh I thought like actually yang aku akan like will go itu I thought like people would really go to because like we like
okay aku dengar macam actually dorang nya price for okay pharmaceutical wise lah ya pharmaceutical wise dorang cakap mahal it's very mahal some
some medications dorang cakap is mahal gila some I think it's like affordable
apa tu suburbs
oh kampung
apa singapore because like singapore I see like if any land any
padang aku nampak ah padang bola semua dah jadi dah jadi apa kondo ke sia
kirakan kirakan macam like bohong lah dia bohong lah aku
ya because mat salleh semua ingat kita china apa we are part of china

like they they interview the the was it director or something then it's like oh err apa oh actually rumah ni kat like I forget which part of malaysia ah like kat malaysia
siala all the background semua edit sia
why serious asal
I mean okay lah but then macam let's say it's a nice story ah and okay you know how I like hmm how kenapa aku nak cakap pasal black panther tapi aku sedih pasal chad mati but ya you know like how they say black panther it's like very refreshing to see like an all black cast so this one is also similar lah it's like all asian cast

ya something like the guy I don't know why the guy would like got hype like to me he's okay jer lah like okay lah handsome handsome tapi macam
kenapa kurang jahat sangat sia just because like okay his asian looking and he has a like apa american-ish accent he has an accent like so actually he's from malaysia like
tak handsome tak hebat
they say have is it at sequel or I mean like a trilogy ke apa ah aku tak tahu ah tapi ada lah itu it's like
the crazy rich asian also is actually trilogy ke sequel but it's a different title something like that but I don't know ah this one rumours ah aku tak tahu ah aku tak search
so kau tengok lah
oh kau kau tak pay full attention there ah
eh oh oh apa jadi apa jadi eh juga
mm aku tengok no lah
okay so kan ada rumour dorang cakap err don't don't support because the place that they they filmed is near the camp site then like the more
the more dorang cakap tak boleh the more aku tengok sia obviously and then
lepas tu like because of that apparently china ban the movie that's what I heard from my friend that's what I heard from my friend they say like err ban in china that's why like it's very accessible on the website lah so I watch it on website lah
and the quality is not that bad honestly it's not that bad tengoklah then like okay I know mulan is not going to be the the the macam typical Disney tau like there won't be any musical
the bila aku dengar that part right I like eh aku dah boring lor because I I really love mulan the the cartoon one eh aku suka sangat lagu reflection
ya lepas tu apabila dari life general tua sahaja donnie yen ketua ip man
lepas tu aku disappointed sia
so we like her to fall in love with the general like shang but she fall in love macam another fellow err apa soldier
that's the thing okay so according to my mum mak ku cakap like pe you need pe you know something different daripada like typical Disney ya exactly if Disney like
I expected like some entahlah I was disappointed lah with but jalan cerita was okay like is like normal lah and then lepas tu okay what my friend say that before like err I watch the movie my friend said the the the mulan lead actress
the apa tak muka dia tak expression eh no expression like when she act macam just very boring lah aku tengok
okay lah sikit jer expression dia because like dalam movie kan K she dia nak act macam lelaki kan so macam like so she act macam laki macam tak senyum there's no expression there's not much expressions tapi like the real guy is like ketawa ketawa buat buat muka
eh tepat
apa ya the woman yang
ya lagu tu yang pasal apa ya yang pasal nak cari perempuan ah dorang tengah apa imagine orang ada mata air ada perempuan
aku lupa juga aku lupa but ya that that song like obviously takde lagu dia kat dalam movie tu but they were like a a line a line ya a line from

untuk aku merepek ah
just give me better wage why would eh eh penat tau
okay let's go back to first thing that we kita berbual tadi we are always rushing for time kau nak aku kerja dua job family mana
ah kau nak complain pasal ah apa apa apa err birth rate uh decreasing of birth rate because kau nak suruh aku kerja dua kerja eh
eh dia ingat dia senang ah dia minister ah
oh my gosh woo lawak wah kejap kejap kejap
part time boleh seven dollars sikit saja
up just up the pay by what nine dollars I think I think nine dollars honestly like this time okay lah fine this time because of COVID mungkin susahlah let's say non COVID period just up the the part time to like nine dollars at least ah at least
ya exactly the only thing that were that one is just time ah minyak okay lah let's say we don't we don't use the the the car or the bike ah we use scooter
tak ke minister gila nak sama kita kerja dua job
my places places apa
okay tempat kerja aku
uh apa they they have this form to let uh what does it call ah macam and need to sign ah let's say like oh to confirm that I'm not working another job you know that thing ah ah ah that one
the second job ya I mean obviously saya nak saya boleh ah tapi like macam still haiya entahlah I really think it's a bit
let's say kau kerja government government based job
then lepas tu second job tak akan eh you cannot you cannot have two government jobs also what
to do the bake bake uh apa
uh apa ya so aku kerja full time abeh lepas tu
more income because you kau penat seh
bagi kamu pilih time or money aku pilih money pasal apa aku selalu broke
ya it's a very tough question lah that's like aku just like it sucks ah you gonna sacrifice ah kalau kau nak duit takde time kalau kau nak time kau takde duit
so kita penat
kalau nak link to suicidal thought suicidal rates also increase what
where last time they think that eh apa you suicide you depressed only it's like oh you're just stress
ya I think because one thing sekarang internet accessible what so ya it's easy then that time uh apa
projects school project aku apa kena search for mental health oh my god
the more I read because okay the thing is it's just not depression there's anxiety there's uh what panic disorders there's these disorders eh banyak sia disorder
and like the more I read is like thing kan dorang macam cross
cross link macam cross link gitu ah it's like it's so like when I read like eh am I reading about anxiety or am I reading about another another disease because it's like so similar but it's actually different oh my god and like macam when I read it is like
ha jijik the split
tak tak tak tak eh tak eh haiya
ya ya ya it's also a great exposure also lah then that time ah apa aku I don't know what was I doing when YouTube then like I wasn't supposed macam the feed eh ah no no not recommended I don't know lah
diagnose ah this woman and it was like old like macam eighties seventies so it was a black and white video
then you know how like that that that generation of people right like you know their voice especially for women okay ang moh ah mat salleh
dia dorang punya tone yang suara macam macam very like happy macam tu kan imagine that and then like
oi kata tipu
is tak betul
nanti ya
the going to the last part ah apa uh when the beast came out
ya the beast came out then the girl like was ready with the short gun kan then lepas begitu uh dia gitu err dia macam dia nak bunuh pe talking about pure and impure you know about that part
basically the girl has macam like history lah she got rape dia kena rape daripada uncle dia
when she was young then lepas tu when she grew up obviously dia macam loner bawa bloodshed rumah then lepas tu she I think she got suicidal thoughts lah she got self-harm so there were scars like
but normal girls because she he kidnapped three girls K one of it pure than the other two mereka macam popular kind then is like oh kau tak pure
kau macam tak kisah gitu pasal orang something like that ah
but when they showed the scars of the girl who's like oh you're pure because in a way is like dia tahu rasa sakit kau tak tahu rasa sakit that's why aku rasa dia pure daripada kau
okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe entah bah
wait wait wait so kirakan like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like err
ya we top we we top the rank ah isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases tu lah pasti
but by that time um we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like kita pergi Bangkok for like satu minggu holiday
even though like you know there were threats of um like you know this unknown virus being spread around lah tapi
we went to Japan habis habis lepas tu was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal
dia pakai dia the kind macam dia pakai mask
habis like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a uh metal tube with like hundreds of um other people like he will refuse to wear dia punya mask and I'm like
aku tak faham so anyway
sorry so ya begitu lah but ya then after that it's like err
uh they took unpaid leave and then after that err I I I tanya dia orang lah like eh so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on err what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then dorang cakap macam eh kau lucky sia kau um um you left at a very good time and then I'm like
but ya macam begitu ah and err like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
you do you remember that um the viral video that fiasco the whole Ateeqah Mazlan punya benda that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like macam padanlah muka dia
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up siapa is it or something is it I can't remember
ya habis tu apa macam like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them dia macam nak dia berniat nak
dia I think I think her niat is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place um apa eh
uh like the current regulations that are in place mm related to home based business begitu
tak satisfy is like an understatement because dorang I mean like you know like melayu punya backlash is like next level dorang macam like oh err
err dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup
kan as in what do they say uh they said something about like err nak tutupkan err nak kacau periuk ah
periuk nasi orang something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi so funny
okay I did not think that it was our good friend Hadi pasal si
of course lah I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID eh sorry during it's like people will stuck at home okay lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan kan
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum macam frus
dia orang masih kerja like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than uh more than ever and like
it's still a kerja ah kerja tu kerja lah but like you know
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some macam
the apa tu barang barang for the err how do you say the the items for the supermarket kan
how how long is that show two hours is like dua jam I don't think you can like squeeze everything together lah
highly taxing job for example kan macam like in a family a a low income family of like for example dia punya anak dia err anak dia special needs kid
habis lepas tu the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older habis dorang tak ada they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
people who are like who are eligible for like macam help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular um like income ceiling for example and then after that like macam err
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like macam you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so macam I guess
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like err because err apa
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very leceh pasal like you know because
there were at least macam twenty people in the class then after that like err we
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so macam kita very move very FOMO
and this was the very funny part so kita orang punya exams we  kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one eh apa eh
we were revising and basically we were revising based on err what the exam usually entails lah macam like
like like ada ada open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sitting for the exams then COVID happened
err so that time nak like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working ah
uh there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book tapi kita orang macam like
eh get real lah kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan you know go on Whatsapp lepas tu kita text eh kau tahu tak what's this what's the answer for this but in
so it's like um basically we were err there are there are like three different kinds of exam so macam like open task
so macam like we get on we we all got go online lepas tu we all sit down together
buka tu link duduk for two hours ku duduk situ
kau buat tu err exam just like a normal exam tapi err ni in the comfort of your own home  begitu
well nothing because okay for that macam the time exam kan the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like ada forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
ha you memang betik
I enjoyed my life met so many many different people habis lepas tu like now err bila I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now pasal like err how to say this like um I'm much older than I was obviously
dia pandai tahu dia pandai she graduated from mass comm eh no she graduated from advertising
Ngee Ann similar course tapi dia punya dia punya
distracted tak tak boleh tahan so I had a project before just like macam like maybe two weeks ago ya so dia sibuk dengan dia punya boyfriend punya birthday
habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam you know it's a group work
so nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk and then discuss lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa in a powerpoint
presentation nak kena prepare pasal kita orang ada presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that kita kena buat like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
I said to her okay you know what aku buat aku buat yang lit review punya part lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like macam kita orang punya um information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report itu pun dia tak boleh buat
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so dia boleh
dia boleh lah pergi mana mana like dia punya boyfriend dia punya twenty third birthday dia pergi prepare all the apa tu
gifts for him bagai can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
because is like even though when I was working tak ada chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
itu part time just
we are online uh we doing online lessons right now kan so like half the time kita
um kita log-on like at 9 o'clock
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and leceh gila then I was like err
tak nak ah malas ah but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks um
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that duduk dekat atas meja lah and do my work
this semester so I macam like to be able to connect with them in a level err I mean like online everything is very cool
as in this particular Food Panda thing dia punya promo jer daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja as in like err
entah lah
ha apa
kita boleh pergi pe Sentosa island or like pulau ubin ke pulau hantu ke like our friend went to pulau hantu what recently
itu itu next level I was
kejap now is like almost two o'clock ya I what's what's classes what are classes
eh thirty plus dollars compared to my twenty five thousand dollars is nothing okay diam sudah diam

the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we uh our exam punya duration would be like three hours right
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual ah question answer kind of thing ah cause ya ya cause it's like um I'm taking it uh for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's err what's the subject oh education secondary uh educational psychology nya subject so it's like

uh cerita dia like it's about um cerita dia it's about like um this person
eh aku selama ni err dekat dunia aku aku
buat jahat jer tapi kenapa like ya tapi kenapa like she's quite dia macam like she's she's asking herself she's questioning herself like um tapi kenapa aku dekat the good place like shouldn't be ya macam like tak ke patut ya lah tak ke patut aku dekat the bad place ya but then turns out that

um faham faham I can see I can see ah ya ya ya ya
and they don't mind tau like they just put their macam opinion on the twitter out there and macam
to me it's so brave and it takes a lot of courage to do that I just cannot macam like imagine the the what the critics ah I mean I think the critics are like macam I think I I I'm usually macam scared about like
the critics or like how people will judge me after that ah basically like oh you have this kind of thought macam you know kind of thing but then ya I mean it has uh huh
can can macam there's something that stopping you kan macam err okay to me usually I would say
to me I will usually say um ya sorry to me I usually macam what's stopping me at the same time is like my baseless assumptions ah atau macam baseless thought faham ke macam I didn't do a lot of reading but this is what I thought so I'm not sure like if I should like express it you get what I mean
ya ya ya ya oh my god oh my god faham faham faham faham macam like oh you you have this kind of like ya ya ya
ya but ya I also like respect them ah like um I mean like ah as to what you said just now about like I mean let's say if macam somebody or someone doesn't really agree with that that that opinion of theirs
like they are able to actually discuss about it faham ke
like to me I think if I were to put something kan then if another person would reply then I would be so cuak already like macam okay so what should I answer now macam wonder like
kan kan kan like I wouldn't deactivate cause of that ah basically macam like I wouldn't deactivate twitter just cause I I know that like through twitter you can get uh like updates ah like and they talk about like this sensitive I mean like especially I mean the millennials right you know right

tapi alhamdulillah

sini sini takda apa-apa eh
tapi susah lah I don't have that ah woman attraction ah aku susah nak dapat attention daripada perempuan I don't know why but
tapi kita punya uh syarikat ni kan ada satu yang ada satu macam punya perangai ah
macam mana eh
tapi macam mana kau bilang aku eh kita kat sini berapa orang jer manpower habis tu
sampai sekarang takde takde ah lagi satu placement untuk orang
abeh macam mana sia kerja
ah the apa tu works that they have done for the ah and then ah ya correct correct
boleh ah I think I think can get ah
korean ada eh
jepun punya orang ah
you can try ah tapi kalau
yang cement part where they want to pour
yang belakang tu belakang glass
the the the one ah beside the toilet kan ada glass panel kan
tapi it won't affect our glass ah katakan dia dia

banyak leceh ah I don't know ah how you want to handle her but
email pun takde ah
email pun takde ah
abeh main cakap jer nanti kita prepare lepas tu
panel kecoh
talking about this jimat apa cerita jimat bila nak
tubuh ada dengan siapa ah tu
aku baru lima puluh enam minit sia
macam mana tu kau handle aku pun sorry for you ah but
nanti appraisal dia kasih pun it's up to
bagus eh
ini tak boleh lah
down here ah the way they do appraisal macam mana tau okay appraisal time I give you the appraisal form you you go and grade yourself
actually I was kind of thinking of doing something macam similar
because I kind of miss macam
buat benda like I miss being like creative I guess
so like aku rasa like um
I follow a lot of macam Instagram shops actually and like
because like aku sekarang kirakan aku I don't have eh no no no sorry I have free time now
I mean I'm a bit I I was kind of used to dapat kerja but
yes dah so um I think
I think maybe I want to macam
I mean I I always see I selalu cakap nak
baju you know what I mean but then I I don't know ah I don't know where to start where do you start
I know that a lot of people have like macam
aku aku maybe rasa macam low-key aku boleh I can tell that some people
pandemic punya tu then like
and I mean I understand also lah cause aku pun sama juga
like at first aku pun sama juga but then like
aku macam low-key macam not not jealous but macam
I don't know how to explain the feeling ah I think I think aku macam
it makes me want to start my own not not that I want to start my own or what it's just macam
semua dia punya kedai semua macam sama-sama you know then like
obviously kita orang like feel like we can do better so
the thing is right yang yang kau cakap pasal the embroidery punya tote bag tu it's
honestly kan I nampak pernah nampak dekat TikTok
so like I I tend to scroll through and kadang-kadang I come across eh bukan apa uh the TikTok is like
macam shop punya lah then I saw this one I'm pretty sure it's a or or whatever it's a foreign punya
country punya shop then this girl basically
she does the same thing dia buat tote bag then she pakai sewing machine then the way that she realise
she can do the embroidery too it's because dia punya machine ada dia punya function abeh aku macam dalam kepala otak aku aku macam
isn't that like macam no offence
I understand it probably takes a time to macam like sit there and actually like betulkan settings and all it tapi macam
kalau it's like simple to and it's not her herself tengah embroidered right is the machine doing it
that orang singapore buat so macam kalau is macam simple gitu then like
one particular this uh apa ni account like jual
apa tu spectacle chain or whatever
maybe have baju custom fit for their own
kadang-kadang boleh pakai S kadang-kadang boleh pakai M depends lah uh most of the time S M gitu
then like you know how they have those uh sizes macam
kalau Cotton On they have um S M or like
how is it that this uh yang I tengah pakai ni like it's considered S M then I'm like does it fit every
you M but you on the verge of L like kau boleh sumbat ke ni
apa tu nama dia not really don't really have a lot of free ya loose so ya
to me and you I guess cause kita orang dua selalu baca kan so kita tahu like what's the difference
ada a few kedai kedai macam
online macam Loop Garms
there's also another one dekat jalan pisang yang Flame V that's that's one I always go to actually
because it's not that high sangat dia punya prices but ya like apa
and is actually this ah you tahu uh jericho
like he was really a fan of the nineties punya semua so
pernah pergi area itu then like macam a few times drop by already together
then I think dia selalu berbual dengan one of the owner I think isaac or whatever then um
I was like kenapa kau tak nak tanya jer jer lah but then he macam malu so I decided to do it
then apparently that shirt is a hundred dollars then aku macam
macam mana boleh hundred dollars ni macam expensive gila
maybe it's cause macam maybe it's imported from somewhere macam
then like they take into account like shipping fee and stuff like that tapi macam I don't know it's like
cause honestly it's not cause thrifting is macam
I mean the the concept is the same it's just that vintage kau betul-betul pay the price for the vintage ah thrifting
I mean in I think actually it is vintage if it's like lama gila and like
you can see that is macam been used before and stuff like that it is vintage in a sense but then vintage in my opinion is more like
because it can also be an investment what kalau
that shirt yang chris jericho punya shirt tu technically it can be an investment cause like
they maybe not don't really know of chris jericho ah cause dia kan lama-lama sikit kan
ah ya dia macam punya tu but like
ten twenty years down the road maybe even fifty years down the road maybe there will still be people who's still willing to macam
old like old outfits old trends and then they want to make it macam baru balik it's either they follow
is either they follow the old trends or they take the old trends and make it baru
kita orang just I don't know like how to I don't know how to explain pe seh but I guess like it's been berapa the fashion industry dah lama
ah dibina so like
like people dulu macam tak kesah but like at least now kita orang macam
lelaki tu meant well but then
kind of um macam mana nak cakap eh
macam misused it
right misuse and also macam ya lah just salah guna
I honestly I honestly think it's cause kita orang macam
just kita orang no longer live in that
so like once we use something we just nak buang
we we are actually talking about apa tu uh kedai right
you just cuba lah jual to to your like whoever who's ordered you ada berapa banyak order sekarang
oh tapi belum
orh yang uh yang backpack tu eh orh K
I think maybe you just try to sell to to the current orders sekarang ni yang you ada kan
you once you dah dibayar um
honestly kalau you nak kan promote is actually not that
you can actually macam
apa eh
but then if you buat macam specific ads or whatever right
it will normally show up macam kau bila kau tengok story orang kan it will pop up between stories gitu
it's not really macam
I think you got I think you pernah tag me under
like cause it's very macam it's not only unique but then like it's very macam ikut
demand gitu it's kind of cool
I would I would probably suggest uh macam
kau start with a few design abeh kau
macam kau post dulu then whichever is popular
like kau just keep note like take note in your head which one's popular then um kalau
kalau ada um
orang macam minta or whatever
like I guess you can just macam buat macam poll lah on your story whatever then you just ask like
uh kalau kau tak kau tak macam tanya customer kau like apa dorang nak and stuff like that it's hard to gauge and like what if
kau tak ada inspiration you know what I mean like what if tiba-tiba you
then obviously it will be susah what so I think it's important to have like
dia ada following so senang in my opinion no offence lah kalau kau ada the following kan
it's just easier for you to macam jual benda cause kau dah ada following banyak orang dia ada dua puluh K tau
dua puluh ribu sorry dua puluh K on her main account ya so like
I'm sure okay maybe not all of them will watch but maybe like ten K gitu akan tengok apa
ya maybe like half gitu at most I mean at least maybe ten K
dia tak ada lining eh kat dalam
ya some shops do that kat singapore pun ada cause actually I think I got follow
one I don't remember what's her name but dorang
pernah macam promote a few smaller businesses
then macam that's so cute cause like macam you know like support local ya exactly support local gitu
I kind of macam considered cause you know how I like I love to wear macam outerwear again
actually I considering macam belajar macam mana nak buat cause I love
I love outerwear macam gini I I don't know cause like I don't want to make it like so thick
but I love outerwear gini like I love I don't know why but I think I love the baggy look a lot
I stress out about the fact that I have free time abeh
bila aku dah stress out pasal free time until nanti aku cari kerja pula abeh abeh like I never use that free time wisely
actually um kau tahu kan uh I was considering uh apa tu
uh sambung belajar ya
because my parents are quite okay lah I'm very blessed because they quite supportive lah dorang macam
dorang okay kalau aku nak kerja ke nak belajar ke
dorang macam aku punya pasal nak buat apa but
still thinking about it and then one of the things aku realise
because uh aku dah I know aku baru kerja dua jobs but I I guess my parents pun realise macam
aku macam adaptable cause like
whenever aku kerja senang jer adapt to the situation cause it's just kerja what you know what I mean like it's not really
but ya so uh apa aku macam realise
a part of me macam
I realised that kalau kau tahu accounting
course kau tak pernah tu eh
is I don't know why I didn't do well but honestly is quite simple it's just macam
I don't know how to explain kau tahu macam
tak it's not that um
kau pernah dengar the term macam assets liability
all that right ya is basically is basically macam
how do I put this normally businesses ada accounting accountant
so basically uh accountant ni macam keep track of their balances
macam accounts lah apa-apa account bank account ke apa ke like
there will always be balance right then you can see like kau spend on what and stuff like that basically it's meant to
the job is meant to tengok and make sure that the accounts balance cause if there's
something macam off sikit dorang kena track kenapa off and like
why is it off like maybe dia macam
it's either terlebih or terlalu sikit then they must check where it is lah
aku pernah belajar kan I told you right I I think I took it for O level but I never
um bila aku fikir balik
it's not difficult lah it's just that at that time aku tak interested nak belajar tu benda cause like it's
aku aku rasa cikgu aku just dreadful agaknya ah
but ya then like kalau accounting kan actually ada banyak
ada banyak sector cause you can do auditing you can do ah bookkeeping
if you are an accountant kan kau macam
in a way kau boleh jadi your own boss I guess
I don't know I'm that's the way my parents put it lah but kalau kau
ada macam some form of background in accounting senang sikit kau nak
dapat kerja in a way
because I think the the main thing is cause you know how sekarang kan pandemic kan
so like ah kalau kau fikir balik the main
mana-mana pun food ada kan and um
these things are the macam industries that won't be so affected for some reason I don't know why
and what ah but like you know ah apa tu
tak interested untuk tengok> but I always see that one scene pop up the one where she makes that comment lah about that guy
oh aku tak suka ah plot macam gitu
you know like what we said about sustainable fashion kita orang no longer ignorant
so because kita orang no longer ignorant I guess um
dorang just trying to fit into
betul like a proper cause that they doing like
like black character to be extremely loud or whatever just ikut just ikut stereotype you know what I mean
nama dia jason like in the show jason dengan
honestly aku rasa aku rasa macam mana I I know I had a point but then like
pasal kita dah berbual aku macam lost my point ah mm
sekejap eh
aku rasa okay pasal tadi kau berbual pasal yang hijab tu kan
yang firefighter and then the grey's anatomy bodoh lah it's so it's ah it's just
low-key aku rasa is because dorang ada
fascination dengan budak
aku rasa dorang ada I think right it it low-key has something to do with also
I don't want to say it ah but I think aku low-key rasa porn has something to do with it because
it's not a uncommon thing aku rasa lah K is not that I know
I mean honestly aku uh bila aku I honestly feel bad for her cause like
she unintentionally might have contributed to that but also bila kau tengok balik
it's not not budak-budak melayu I think
I think in general lelaki melayu I don't know why not all
guys tend to macam wonder what a woman okay the woman can be completely covered tapi dorang will wonder for some reason I don't know how
will wonder what the woman is wearing underneath then aku macam
like aku tak akan pernah fikir pasal dorang punya
tu tau
kadang-kadang dorang ada dorang punya argument kadang-kadang is
but lelaki pun kena kena rogol pe something like that lelaki pun ya they sometimes bring that up as a point tapi aku macam
but why would you like it's not like okay dorang selalu macam
fikir kita orang tak faham or like
we always fight for just kita orang but like we actually fighting for other people also what
it's not just kita orang fikirkan pasal perempuan jer it's that just so happens
perempuan suffer more
pasal kita perempuan like
ikut biology or whatever but then
some of us aren't exactly build to macam
kecil I um kecil
okay ah aku faham
dorang masih buat cerita macam tu macam uh it's either kahwin kaya ke
kahwin uh apa tu bukan kahwin kaya not only that uh
ah kahwin contract
aku tak tahu aku tahu kenapa dorang tak boleh single
like okay aku low-key rasa kan
kita orang uh sebagai melayu kita orang actually maybe we don't really
actually had okay lah kita ada nafsu tapi macam aku rasa the only reason kita motivated by kita punya nafsu
it's also by cerita-cerita macam gini that like promote kita untuk
macam encourage kita untuk macam apa macam
oh kahwin kahwin sikit-sikit kahwin kahwin kahwin muda
kahwin tua pun ada kadang-kadang cerita merepek sia
uh uh kadang-kadang kadang-kadang problem dia dalam perkahwinan boleh kahwin lagi aku macam
like like the common plots is always macam apa kau tak boleh produce baby ke
pastu kahwin kahwin kenapa kau tak boleh adopt ke apa ke like why
I I aku rasa tak akan achieve
kereta I will ask for a car and I also ask for money
and I will also ask for an unlimited supply of kasut
so like so pape kalau aku nak main bola ke main
pakai apa apa-apa kasut lah
actually pandai ah
but I think also genie sesuai kalau genie is the one granting your wishes ah
tahu I know I know but then for for shoe right
cam ah makin turun turun turun banyak duit so like
and you know kereta untuk you know gi sini gi sana semua
so kalau kalau aku dah ada duit ada kereta
kasut is for my own needs ah but
apa yang like
tak worth it lah of course it's not gonna be worth it what because like
your life would be macam
life tak bagus ah
dapat semua benda pe
like dorang nak apa like
sorang ada sorang nya opinion pe so like kalau
kalau you know if our opinions are different right then it is what it is ah like ya
so first first first kan aku nak perempuan lawa punya
ah kalau kalau tak lawa aku tak nak
hati kena bagus ah macam hati dia kena bagus kena macam aku nak dia caring loving
okay we talking about this minor details in women that I look for of course there is lah there are a few ah so I'll tell you about my life ah like I can be honest ah dalam hidup aku kan
aku keluar dengan tiga perempuan jer tau
tiga perempuan the first one she can make me laugh she uh boleh buat aku ketawa semua ah
tapi kan dia take it one step too far she make me laugh too much
like macam dia suka main-main aku text tak nak reply semua then abeh berbual serious
serious punya benda dia
dia macam buat macam kelakar semua then you know
she ah dia tak boleh
handle jokes semua then kena aku selalu kena care for her ah like
takleh kena takleh kena sikit ke apa ah
then bila berbual dengan dia kan
nak buat macam joke kelakar semua kan dia dia nak sepak aku sepak muka aku ke apa ah nak cari gaduh so the third one right
to be needy you know like I don't want her to be too needy like selalu
like dia selalu macam
so like semua benda semua benda dia
like cari aku
then aku kena pergi sana jumpa dia berbual dengan dia dia nak nangis aku kena gi sana semua
cam dia tengah contact dengan uh satu orang satu laki ke kau takut ah tu

cam this is the one ah
kira kan macam fade ah
macam kalau kita punya break up macam
kau punya macam senang macam just ended smoothly like no hiccups or anything then okay lah boleh jadi kawan tapi macam
kawan pun bukan macam best friend ke apa ah macam
kawan macam low-key macam boleh cakap ah hi bye friends ah
tu technically kawan tak ah you know what I mean
but then kalau break up macam rabak kita macam gaduh semua kan tu like
try jadi kawan balik macam susah kan macam
untuk aku kan like ah kalau aku just break up then aku nak move on it takes me like at least at least ah four months I would say
it really depends on the person ah like kalau aku cam
kalau aku handsome gila ke apa ke then uh
senang-senang dapat perempuan semua aku tak kan move on
berapa berapa lama kan
it's not wrong ah it's not completely wrong tak salah pe kalau cam care pasal ex kau ke apa it's not wrong it's like

biasa ah tak ada kerja
tak apa if you nak I masak kan I think dapur tu terbakar terus
cause kan I have a friend uh nama dia amelia
I don't know what she was cooking ah tapi kan dia kasi bila dia kasi family dia makan kan semua kena food poisoning
I don't even know I think wait I think she was baking some sugar cookie entah
I think untuk raya ke pe but then I don't know what she put inside baking soda wait you do put baking soda inside cookies right
okay then I don't know what she put inside that poisoned her entire family but ya selain dari masak is there any other position I can do anything but cooking
I don't mind as long duit halal and it doesn't involve cooking or maths because I'm not good at maths I mean like if simple calculation saya boleh tapi you nak I buat algebra tu semua mampus
okay oh my god thank you so much you know I've gone for so many interviews kan but then semua orang tak nak orang pakai hijab hijab atau melayu like there was this one tuition centre that I applied for they were like happy with my grades tu semua and then dorang dah dorang accept tau and then lepas tu dorang tanya like for my race lah and then like what language I speak tu semua then I was like oh
I malay and then I give him my full name then he was like oh I'm sorry but um the position has been filled so we cannot hire you then I was like bro you just mentioned not too long ago that you wanted to hire me then sekarang mentang-mentang I kata that
I melayu you don't wanna hire me anymore
entah lah and then like there was another company ah err it was an accounting company so I'm from uh I was from a media course then I have a media diploma then I went for this um digital marketing job and the person told me during the interview that I don't have the qualifications but in order to get a job at their company I need to be willing to buka my hijab
kan so I ask lah kenapa nak kena buka hijab and then they were like oh cause they deal with a lot of um western people western clients european people and these people they don't really like working with orang islam
pada diorang kan pemikiran dorang ialah
kita orang jahat so kalau dorang nampak yang company ni ada pekerja islam pakai hijab tu semua kan dorang tak nak work with this company
and then the thing is the thing that upsets me the most is that they paksa the pekerja kat situ untuk buka hijab there's like dua ke tiga pekerja kat situ at first dorang kerja boleh pakai hijab tau then all of a sudden I think new management ke pe ah dorang kena terpaksa buka hijab cause kalau tak dorang kena buang kerja
and then you know ah sekarang tengah COVID nineteen nak cari kerja bukan main susah kan so those few workers had no choice but to buka hijab dorang kesian seh wah aku macam nak sepak jer muka dorang like eh bro what does us wearing a hijab have anything to do with our capabilities or anything my mak kerja dekat company besar okay it's a it's an american company that was bought over by a japanese company
and in this company my mak pakai hijab pun boleh naik pangkat tinggi tau you know and there's ramai orang islam kat situ in fact one of her receptionist just converted to islam
and they are okay with them wearing hijab so what is this small local accounting company so against orang pakai hijab you know I think that's just them being racist
menyampah seh
and it's not just in malaysia that orang islam boleh pakai hijab like there's a lot of countries out there that allows their muslim workers to wear hijab even though I have to admit lah singapore lagi bagus sebab the racism isn't really that obvious here but still though you know my I my uh obek kan she actually works at I don't remember which hospital but then she has to remove her hijab
and she's not even a nurse she's just what is she doing ah uh I think she was doing laundry ya so dude you are doing laundry you don't even have to face the people like the um orang-orang semua pesakit-pesakit so like why do you have to remove the hijab that's so stupid what does have wearing a hijab have anything to do with doing laundry I can wear a hijab and do laundry also
his group was in a different court sedih seh I susah-susah penat-penat belajar squash join squash but then tak sama-sama pun
diana wants to set me up with her boyfriend's friend and her boyfriend I'm sorry to say this okay if you ever meet her don't tell her that I told you this tapi kan boyfriend dia kan tak handsome langsung
ya so her boyfriend is a muka muka bukan perangai perangai dia okay lah like he's okay except for the fact that he procrastinates a lot
like okay I I admit that I'm no saint myself but and I procrastinate a lot a lot tapi kan dia kan okay like there was this one time where his boss gave him this job two weeks ago and then he promised her on like okay first week second week the friday kan on the day that he was supposed to submit to um his work to his boss he promised diana that he was going to go on a date with her
tapi kan you fikir bila dia start dia punya kerja nope the day itself like the day of submission itself
kan and then on that day I I was out lah so I didn't notice diana texting me and then lepas tu bila I check my phone kan diana was like eh babe you free tak nak keluar I tengah bosan ni tengah tunggu my guy and then lepas tu I I cuma layan dia via text sebab cause I tak boleh jumpa dia I tengah kat luar pe and then lepas tu dia pukul dua baru dia datang then the whole time she was calling him and texting him dia tak jawab dia mengamuk dengan diana
kan and then lepas tu dia tak minta maaf tak apa
ya and then lepas tu dia bilang<malay diana kan err eh I tak suka tau you asyik call I tanya I kat mana huh text I spam I nanti I dah habis kerja I bilang you lah you jangan nak spam boleh I tak suka
kan oh my god I was so mengamuk and the fact that he didn't apologise to her like bruh who the hell do you think you are you are not even handsome okay and that's not the worst part okay so he has done that quite a lot of time lah that's not the worst part the worst is that dia tak percaya dengan tuhan
he said that tuhan tak wujud there's no such thing as god
but but the fact that you call yourself a muslim tapi you tak percaya dalam tuhan like why do you even bother calling yourself a muslim
ya like like I respect everyone's belief lah tapi kalau you tak percaya you you tak percaya lah you jangan nak bilang orang lain you don't try to force your belief onto other people
diana dia bukannya halal sangat
tapi pun dia tetap percaya dalam tuhan you jangan nak shake her beliefs tau huh you jangan nak bilang dia tuhan tak wujud tu semua it's up to her what she want to believe in
siapa dia nak sembah kalau dia nak sembah tuhan syukur alhamdulillah bagus lah untuk dia you jangan nak marah-marah dia jangan nak tengking dia kena percaya dalam tuhan boleh tak you tak suka you cari perempuan lain ah
the lelaki is he's a medic so I don't mind medics lah
makes me sound like some narcissistic but anyway I bilang dia ah I bilang dorang yang oh err maaf ah tapi I'm sure your friend is a great guy tapi I don't think kita jodoh and then lepas tu I kata but then if you nak kita jadi kawan I tak kisah
so you you nak I cakap dengan dia okay but you need to make sure that he understands that it's only as kawan nothing more nothing less kawan saja okay then dia okay okay then lepas tu I kata okay I don't him to have my number I don't want him to have my social media account I don't want him to know anything about me unless I believe that you know we can be friends tu semua lah we can click as friends
right I don't even wah he called me golden child I was like so lost like is that is that supposed to be a reference to anything like I'm sorry I watch anime but I don't really watch other shows like what what is golden child even and then lepas tu dia kata uh he he started going on about how so um our friends decided to matchmake us cause they believe we're perfect for each other then I'm like bruh
I told them that it is never going to work out between us as anything more than as friends so you jangan nak fikir-fikir jauh-jauh boleh tak he really believe that kita perfect for each other tau
this isn't really a matchmaking event or anything so like you tak suka you tak suka lah boleh belah like in a more polite way okay then he just screenshot my reply he sent it to my friend and her boyfriend then they they were like scolding me like eh why are you sending him such a formal reply you know you sepatutnya cakap gini-gini you jangan nak cakap gitu boleh tak huh
kesian tau dia then I was like kesian dia I your kawan untuk lebih dari tujuh tahun okay you tak kesiankan I
kan and then she was trying to sell him to me like oh he has a ducati he has a lot of motor he's a medic he earns a lot like five figure or something then I was like bruh I know lah I I mata duitan juga tapi I tak lah gitu teruk mentang-mentang dia kaya you fikir I akan apa stead dengan dia
I ada standard
kalau dia apa kacak sikit eh I don't mind lah and then lepas tu kalau personality dia okay I don't mind but the thing is he just broke up with his chinese girlfriend of like I don't know how many years they were like going they were like super steady for so long they were going to get married tu semua but then um the girl's parents tak tak suka cause um dia islam perempuan tu christian ke pe
ya so they just broke up then then it's like what am I a rebound you are not even that good looking bro just find someone else I'm sorry man ya and then lepas tu sampai sekarang diana keeps on saying that oh she wants to set us up then next time kita hang out together kan dia nak bawa lelaki tu nama dia rudy
nama pun old-fashioned
eww mad ah bro I don't even like the name sorry wah fuck I found I sound so kurang ajar seh no but serious that's I don't know like I just feel like he's not my type like we can never click there's no chemistry between us like seriously who starts up a convo by calling the girl golden child
dia fikir kan we were being match made tau so he's really into the idea like he told um diana's boyfriend and diana told me that he's really up for being match made with me kan that's that's how I reacted like like what with first of all I've never even met diana's boyfriend okay second of all we've never met each other I I deleted telegram
after he sent me that message and then I replied to him I deleted telegram so um I don't know if he sent me any messages lah I haven't re-downloaded it and I don't think I will anytime soon and then lepas tu kan um so diana kata err oh I have like my standard tinggi sangat lah I tak boleh pilih-pilih sangat tu semua so she's giving by the end of the month she knows where I live by the way
I'm segan too but I would rather be match made with a guy who is at least like who have something in common with me than with this guy you understand why when I send you his picture
tak boleh seh seriously do you know any guy like it doesn't have to be we don't have to be anything more than friends but I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend all my friends all my guy friends are in and they are either taken or seriously weird
I know lah but I betul-betul tak nak seh dengan lelaki ni and I I don't know who else I can go to to ask for like eh you know any guy friends who can like help me out pretend to be my boyfriend for a while cause oh my god everytime I meet her every dude
um apparently um she's meeting up with her boyfriend tomorrow and she said that her boyfriend is going to bring his friend so she felt segan to go along with him because she doesn't know any of his friends but I know for sure that that is code for she's bringing that rudy guy along
cause she'll know that eh tak kan hari-hari ada family matter seh
you know sekarang kan nak masuk masjid you kena macam register dulu tu semua and then satu kali nak masuk cuma berapa sepuluh orang
ya so nope I think I'm just going to stay home but I do need to find a guy ASAP do you think your kakak knows anyone
so ya and then um we there was this one group project where the teachers group us up and then she was in my group so I was sleeping over in school and then after that she kept on touching me and hugging me and wah and then we had a sleepover in school cause to finish our project kan then lepas tu dia asyik macam pegang-pegang dengan I
then like then then like geli seh
she just pindah to like a few blocks away from me in year two and that was when she started um suka I
kan and setiap pagi kan err cause setiap kali I nak gi sekolah I selalu pergi dengan my mak my mak turun kat jurong then I tukar kat jurong pe and then lepas tu kan nanti dalam tau-tau jer selalu I naik I selalu naik kat belakang sekali
like the last door kan second cabin last door then lepas tu I tengok tau
I selalu tak nampak dia tau-tau je pintu dah tutup pusing-pusing tak ada orang dia dekat belakang I
I usually berdiri dekat pintu yang you know pintu yang selalu tak buka
ya I I duduk kat I selalu berdiri kat situ tau I tak nampak dia<malay tau tau-tau dia akan appear dia akan kata
so so I told her that err indirectly like oh um you know um I have a crush cause at that time I was I had a crush on this guy we called him camera guy but I think I can tell you his name ah cause different school pe nama dia
ya but he was err he was in my academic school we were from together and then lepas tu kan um dia selalu macam everytime there's an event he's like the photographer ah so my friends and I will call him camera guy so that people won't know that we're talking about him
ya and then lepas tu that err I keep on telling the girl who like me like oh you know I saw camera guy again today and then he's so hot tu semua then like I would always purposely mention him whenever she tries to like make a move on me
so at the end of it kita semua marah dia ah
then lepas tu dia tak suka I lagi
ya and then there was another girl who like me also and then um that girl was a bit weird lah because she was telling me about how she was asexual and all that then all of a sudden dia kata oh but you know I wouldn't mind dating you
basically it's like I don't really know how to explain it but it's like social innovation tu semua
ya so um we doing gen ed we would combine classes with other courses tu semua so there was this one girl she was from design and ya she was from design school I forgot which design school she was from um she we we went camping together like it was a school camp lah school trip then she was in my group and she was my roommate for the entire trip it was a week long
ya I I I just I just smile and say oh okay sure err I'm just going to do my work over there but you can go on and shower and then and then lepas tu kan so um she's usually not in the room lah like um she she met this she met this uh guy from we were sleeping in a dorm it was a collaboration with a an indonesian uni
my friends and I we will like sometimes we would just sit on her bed cause it was the closest to the door so we will just sit on her bed like all of our beds lah and then some people would just sit on her bed and then usually like we will like macam basah gitu tau dia nya tilam dia you know what she was doing right
at first we didn't know either because we thought okay maybe like dia habis mandi dia tak lap badan dia betul-betul so dia duduk abeh basah and then lepas tu<malay last day kan bila kita dah nak balik then she just told us oh you know the reason why it's always wet then we're like why kenapa you kena bilang kita like at least okay you bilang kita at the end of the trip but but why kenapa tak bilang kita at start atau you tak bilang kita langsung
I did not need to know what I touched I oh my god and then kan the whole trip she would comment on my badan tu semua tau like oh um
apa cause um she's very open her boyfriend is also super open
she said um if if she's ever like uh if she ever wants to do a threesome dia nak panggil I then I was like okay you ada nombor I and then lepas tu lepas tu I tak contact dia lagi
kan and you fikir it was a one week trip okay or was it two weeks it was almost two weeks actually mak mak I I I tak tahu nak nak happy sebab orang ingat I cantik atau geli sebab I terpegang benda tu atau oh my god I don't even know what to feel man
you ada you ada gambar dia
so err he confessed to me in it was in june holiday I don't remember which part of june holiday and then lepas tu kan uh he he suddenly texted me one four three then I was like one four three apa benda seh so I look it up online lah like I I didn't reply I was like looking up what is one four three then apparently it was like this um
so it means I love you and then I was like oh hell no bish like first of all I felt nothing for him second of all I I was in this um it wasn't really a relationship but our I had this thing going on with primary school friend lah nama dia irfan
so I just muted him lah like oh I'm really sorry bro but I tak suka you so maybe you should just you know move on lah but kita lagi boleh kawan and then he was like okay then he stopped texting me then you know what he did
he spam zi qing asking me to like asking her to get me to accept him tu semua and then it was like I don't know how many days he did that but then zi qing menyampah so she she she like scolded me lah like eh can you tell ateeb to shut up or not ah you know he keep on texting me and spamming me non-stop huh asking me to like get you to get together with him then like oh my god I don't even like him then because of that
uh kitanya clique broke up ah
so so everytime he ask me out like it was to buy stuff for zi qing or like to plan a date with zi qing then I was like bro what am I you know you ask me out you bring my hopes up and then like all for her you might as well just wah fuck I got friendzone so hard so many times man and then ateeb tak give up so apparently kan did you know this apparently ateeb spread a rumour and like a lot of people believed that I was dating ateeb
okay never mind apparently he he spread it to his friends ah so like the guys tu semua
so so I was like huh since when then tala kata apa oh ateeb kata we've been dating since sec two ke sec one then I was like bro I have never liked him that way I never accepted to be his girlfriend I never said yes to him or anything
menyampah seh and then um after that we go off contact ah then in sec err year one poly he texted me uh
begging me for forgiveness then I was like okay you know what we're in poly now so I should be the bigger person and maafkan dia you know matang tu semua
so I kata okay lah I forgive you then kita jadi kawan but then we didn't really text a lot and then you know what happen
kan wait don't tell him that that's why he's like he has a inferiority complex against his abang but anyways then I told him like oh um sorry ah but my friend um I just made up a white lie like oh my friend's already dating someone so she's not interested in you or like in dating anyone else and they will I felt like they will be together for a long time cause like they are they are very um into each other tu semua then I I thought he gave up tau
then err I got angry lah so I scolded him like eh why the hell did you do that sia huh why did you even spam her and all that you know she don't like you right huh you want someone you go find someone yourself lah go on tinder go on okcupid or anything you want to go and harass my friends right menyampah seh
and then lepas tu um he asked me out then I said no obviously like I have never accepted you before what makes you think that I would accept you now you can't even do one push-up properly you dude angin tiup kau pun terbang
kau fikir aku nak dengan kau huh the only good thing about you is you are rich kau nampak lipas kau yang lari kau kalau nampak hantu kau pun lari kalau apa-apa terjadi kau fikir kau ni husband material ke pe huh boyfriend material pun dah tak abeh lepas tu puasa pun dia tak tau I mean like at that time lah I don't know if he puasa now lah because dia lembik sangat
he was so desperate man and then lepas tu uh I rejected him then he keep on begging me again like that time he started getting desperate so I just block him and then lepas tu I don't know how oh oh I changed phone so I guess um I accidentally unblock him on whatsapp lah so in year three we started talking again
like like it wasn't like everyday talk lah like um I was looking for people to help act in my projects then after that um he he said if I need anything just text him ah so I said eh do you know any friend then he was useless all his he said all his friends suck at acting tu semua

I'm not even desperate enough to start dating you what makes you think that I want to be with you huh you and yourtiny ass dickwhat are you going to do man I mean I kata ah you nak you desperate sangat you pergi geylang you cari perempuan sendiri
and then lepas tu dia kata eh tak uh I bayar you I was like I I know lah I suka cakap-cakap macam benda gini I kata I tak kisah tu semua but I ada maruah okay I nak dah kahwin baru I dengan lelaki I nak buat apa-apa suka hati I lah you bukannya matair I you bukan tunang I you bukan laki I why would I sleep with you
kan lagipun you sebagai orang islam you nak paksa-paksa ni kenapa hmm takde iman
nak nak nak main-main I tak kisah lah I pun main-main selalu pe tapi you nak you nak cakap you nak paksa I buat ni untuk apa and then I mengamuk so I I just block him on whatsapp then he started spamming me on text then started calling me non-stop
ya but I didn't I didn't open any of his messages like I just baca the notification then lepas tu I tutup yeah and then lepas tu he found me on telegram
telegram satu benda you know now where he's texting me
oh my god ya but he found my email then okay I haven't even look at the email then he was saying about oh actually um on telegram right he was cursing me out like err why you doing this to me why you ignoring me huh we were we were doing so well together and then dia kata err I didn't even do anything to you and yet you are doing this to me
how could you and then like he was making it up to be like I cheated on him ke pe tau like we weren't even friends we weren't even doing anything I already told you that I wasn't interested in you and then you yang nak mati-mati nak dengan I you yang desperate sangat and then lepas tu I ignore you lah I tak buat salah pe
I dah bilang you I tak suka and then you tetap nak so I ignore lah and then dia mengamuk and then lepas tu dia kata I'll pay you just to reply me wah I was so tempted to say each reply will cost one hundred dollar
you nak you nak I jawab sangat kan ah bayar aku seratus dollar dulu but then I rasa macam mak I kalau dia nya family dia dapat tahu abeh dorang buat police report mampus aku
so I was like okay lah takpe<malay> lah nak duit pun takde lah aku aku desperate sangat
this this monday ke tuesday
err I think I saw him saying like D why you ignoring me please I really need you right now I really need a friend like you then I was like huh you fikir I bodoh sangat ke pe oh my god
then lepas tu we also started talking pun recently juga
ya so then diana main-main dia kata what if ateeb jumpa aku punya address
tak nak ah
so um he I think he bought her a lot of stuff juga lah and then lepas tu uh the one that crystal like was I think it was justin
oh my god dude you know that was my favourite time you know why cause kan um everytime justin tertidur kan then uh he will like depend on me to like take down notes for him tu semua then I tolong dia dengan homework then I betul-betul jaga dia tau so everytime I selalu bawa bekal gi sekolah pe then he would makan my bekal like we would share share tu semua tau
abeh dalam kelas kita selalu main-main sama-sama like
we would play with our phones under the table tu semua tau and then like he he started like suruh I main-main dengan rambut dia
sedih<malay> seh we wah we could have something on damn it but ya I don't know man sedih
hais okay lah um it's been one hour lah so kita end sekarang
what are you doing bukan how are you doing
oh ya I forgot how is your haus kau batuk lagi ke
mm cause aku perasan juga like I notice your cough in your um videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and um and also like when you have kahak in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not um clearing her throat first before she talk
kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
susah tak nak pakai tu like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
oh I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like lambat
orh kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak inhale like deeply ah
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school pun I used to have bad coughs yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama
I have kahak so I have a lot of kahak that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so dia macam satu it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
ah so macam sekarang ni I can recognize it lah when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
macam at that time I think I didn't know cause ah before
actually err is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is um tempeh
err roti kicap
I know I know no but ya I think these three yang betul betul I've been avoiding because
err at first memang I avoided everything I avoided like vitagen yakult lah yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt ah apa tapi macam kalau yogurt is in mm is like a flavor aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak lah
dia is is in at yeast allergy it's like um err fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast kan is a product of fermentation ah so macam tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan because it's like soy bean fermented
ya macam tu sebab lah is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because macam tu lah because uh in some kadang-kadang aku makan
err apa gatal but actually you know uh when I went to clinic my it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new macam active err areas yang gatal and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad ah episode of sinus punya ni like selsema for like one month
so my dad told me to start err drinking yang effervescent tablets tu barakah
so I did and then he ask me I started err started drinking that and then he said that oh ya it's very bad padahal kan I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains um macam yeast ke apa but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
err so err tapi recently because I at first I memang betul betul jaga my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat kicap because kicap is such a common common thing kalau kau masak kan
so dia
ya ya no at that time she's making nasi goreng sambal sotong tau like leftover sambal sotong so dia letak lah kicap tu sikit just for flavour
and then I was I already ate like one full plate and then she's like aina I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put kicap and I was like
tapi I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so malam tu aku macam aku dah ready lah untuk makan ubat
so at that bad macam is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the gatal pun dia kurang lah I can control it so when err after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
so macam I should start
trying out food yang I'm not eating
so I I drank like vitagen once and it was okay tapi aku kurang lah I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
ah cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti
err kicap tempeh yogurt jer lah
actually supposed to go and see the doctor bulan enam but at that time kan I was ah I couldn't go because clinic tu dekat tangkak
ya tangkak kat johor but it's far lah
you know why because is betul betul dekat hujung
betul betul dekat hujung dekat singapore like really is like there
so macam
because especially because my house is err dekat danga bay which is
and then my window is facing the um memorial the sungei that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats ada kelong and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya tapi I'm I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger kan mm kalau kitaorang balik johor
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings kan dorang semua dah ready bawa passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari um like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
dorang some some ah dorang tak produce dorang tak hantar that brand dekat malaysia
so they will go there macam is a trip for them and then kitaorang budak-budak would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
we'll all be like so jealous wah tak dapat ikut pergi singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore dengan malaysia takde beza
sama jer kan sebenarnya
ya it's the same I think ya sama jer it's just that you know at that time I was like wow singapore
ah that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the memang my family memang suka makan roti kitaorang we can go through like one bantal yang besar tu like two days so now substitute is wraps lah
mm so macam always ada tu or you know like prata yang frozen
ah kalau if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
croissant croissant itu memang one of the benda yang paling kelakar
because kau dah terbiasa
ya apa
kan cousin aku kan belajar
tunggu jer lah lunch is almost lunch time
usually kau yang masak ke
um I think dia tak not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
err routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize kan it's not it's not just um sapu lotion on dry skin you have to be bilas with water first and then you have to pat dry and then baru you lotion because then baru dia ada moisture
ah ya ya tapi macam you know if I if I mandi awhile like
wear it bilas and then I put lotion and then is very effective kalau you moisturize it overnight
dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga that's why you know when I was
mm but when I was younger and it was bad memang my mom would paksa
err because sometimes it hurts tau untuk mandi cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
so macam masa tu kan I
ah tak tak
yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia powder tapi dia dalam capsule
ah and then eh that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills pasal kau tahu uh sampai menangis like I tried to eat it until I cried
I open the capsule onto a spoon lepastu aku makan
it's disgusting tapi
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know potong tiga ke to get used to it instead of makan powder jer
tapi dia macam faulty lah
can jap I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like uh after I register tak boleh nak log in pun
tak tahu lah dia punya website dia macam faulty tu yang si nai cakap semalam dengan doctor john
ah you when you register to use your apa punya account
try lah nanti apa I think they need to um solve on their site before they do before you can log in
I get it I get it lah but thing is kat you need like a car
ah tu jer lah I think that's that's really the only macam problem that I have
ah itu jer lah tak banyak pun tapi they haven't responded to my email
aku dia ada dia ada dia macam err inquiry box dekat website tu
ah so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive um interns undergraduate internship apa ya program
tapi dorang tak reply maybe I need to email them directly
ya actually I I agree dorang punya one of the malaysia punya government or any authorities when punya weak link weak point is that dorang punya website is very poorly handle
ah bukan tak pandai they don't see the need
ah macam kita kan apa-apa pun kita akan website dulu ah website website
so tapi aku cari lah kat johor kat johor pun banyak juga
more opportunity banyak tempat but it's definitely gonna be far from my house lah
tapi okay lah as long as you know
yes apa ni apa aku cakap oh when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria kan aku pergi dengan shikin
and I saw um some of the stuff dia tengah macam recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
macam like writing on the clipboard so aku tanya dia aku tanya dia uh kalau apa dorang ambil aquaria ni ambil intern ke lepastu dia kata dia pun intern
ya and then she said that uh apa I ask lah yang selalunya yang feeding kan yang diving and feeding tu dia kata anyone that has a diving license boleh I'm like ah
ah tu lah I wonder also
jauh lah tapi it's either you have a long commute atau you sewa rumah dekat situ lah sewa bilik
kau tahu tak fasha fasha nak buat intern kat johor
sebab uh ya lah but she wants to be close with shami dia nak jumpa lah
so this so kita orang macam dah pernah cakap sebelum ni that if she gets an internship in johor I would I mean if we get in the around same area
ha mari mari tapi johor ni kan besar so we don't know lah
mm mm tak tahu kat mana tu jer ah when I think that
macam is I'm so scared
I saw because I did see my brother going through his internship pun susah gila nak cari no no company would want
mm tapi
tapi I did see some private companies yang bagi internship not bad lah
takde I'm trying to find material for my tapi
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor bagi like
dia dia kan my old title was combining water quality dengan uh macromentoes
so I did my field work tapi since we cannot go to the lab
dia dah published dah tapi dia co author jer dia bukan the main author doctor chan lepastu dia ada data dekat tempat yang sama of macromentoes so aku kena analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper punya data
dia punya paper as a reference for my water quality part
um I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it lah tapi you know ha I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
macam aku aku try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
pastu I go back to it and then aku akan copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
pastu I try to retype it
tapi sometimes it becomes macam disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad tapi tu lah gunanya supervisor
oh laju kali ni supervisor kau laju
last sem aku rasa macam supervisor aku jer yang asik minta ya your supervisor was so quiet
sebab haritu kan kitaorang ada meeting mentor mentee kan dengan doctor chan
uhh macam on the our presentation dia cakap
the examiners all are impressed dengan kita punya presentation
pasal our presentation wise we are all macam mantul tapi when it comes to the writing
ah writing kita ada macam slack
I think must me and my feelings pun macam gitu macam
mm sometimes aku rasa macam oh my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it tapi sebenarnya okay jer
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer yang uh
ah and tapi aku rasa macam my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions dorang akan jawab
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya lah sebab kita nak tahu kan we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
ah memalukan like you feel embarrassed
yang dekat terengganu eh
did you hear about the girl kat terengganu
ah yang kawan ah
wei tu gila dah
ye lepas lepastu dia boleh Whatsapp lagi macam acting as if like nothing
eh bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke
mm macam ramai kan orang punya story macam banyak version
kesian dah like
wife dah lah sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang first kan
but it's so sad lah tapi memang
ada video evidence kan that she entered the house
mm dengan apa I think like hair in her hand
tak boleh log in kan
dah tu lah I think you just wait ah because think somewhat tak boleh tak boleh
I think someone did text the yang apa doctor jaga situ puan puan lin eh
aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh jer
kan dia macam semak
orh dia panggil okay ah
my mum doesn't ask us to help kalau dia tengah masak
ah macam after tu I usually just go and see lah tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta lah minta tolong
aku pun tapi aku kurang lah because aku kan tengok drama yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat netflix
so macam is a lot of more steps to
to watch it tapi sebab you know K drama they are so long
macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ for an hour to watch it
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people punya comments
but I think the K drama yang I watched that had a lot of err long episodes was prison playbook
itu kan I don't usually watch uh slice of life punya drama
I usually watch macam investigative atau medical tapi somehow prison playbook ni
it's interesting and dia kelakar
dia cam just a nice balance of kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar more kelakar than sedih
best tapi tu lah ada episode dia yang one one and a half hours
ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa dah lama dah
sebab you know I'm used to watching um english
english punya series english punya series paling lama pun like forty minutes jer
and then kalau comedy kalau comedy tu
lagi lah twenty minutes twenty minutes jer
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot tapi macam tak bercakap lah kan
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references macam inside jokes
ya dah you know masa tu kan dia kat dalam dia kat channel hallmark
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode baru
so macam my mum was um was very strict with this about bed times ah usually macam ten tu we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister lah my oldest sister kitaorang akan sneak out untuk tengok
I don't know ah sometimes dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar jer
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know biar jer lah macam
let us get away because sometimes kita kena belajar lah to be
especially because kitaorang kan ramai there's like six of us
ah benda macam ni is like a small thing let it go lah
I used to macam tu lah my sister and I would break um bed time
a lot sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok
baca buku yang I don't know time at first it was bagus you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot kalau kitaorang pergi big bad wolf or sale yang like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to simpan and then the worst part is that we have books yang we haven't read but we want to buy new
ah banyak jer sampai sekarang tak baca
tapi my mom dah simpan semua buku dekat my grandma's house punya store so kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam store tu but I read books on my phone now
wei kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek
anak dia pun ramai tau anak dia like wait eh one five or six tapi semua boys
uh the oldest one it's like us around the same age lah cuma the last one the last one beza dengan the second last one was like twelve years or something like that
uh the last one is still is still young still a child still a kid like primary school but the second youngest is our age I think so dorang handsome tau
pernah aku pernah mimpi I was marrying marrying one of them but but it's not
ya this is this is is my dream but I often memang get err
often memang get a really bad not really bad not bad dreams but they just like very weird dreams because
aku jarang tak mimpi then
yang macam banyak kali one of it I can remember is that daripada aku dulu daripada aku kecil tau masa aku dah pandai drive lagi I always dream
that's like daripada dulu lagi I've been having that that one specific dream
sampai I can imagine it now
tapi actually I
I think it's interesting tapi most of the time
I don't really remember unless I betul betul put in effort untuk remember I won't remember
ah I will that's why sometimes I wake up and I'm in a bad mood is because I had a dream yang
made me ah macam you know it's a bad feeling
apa yang what was
I don't know I don't know why we are in our last semester tapi our lecturer wants to
mm mm tu lah
sabar jer lah
bedah pun did you see her tweet
no did she replied me she said there is someone who replies the list responds to the list in a group pastu aku macam oh okay aku dah tahu dah siapa
tapi dia dapat lagi sorang siapa ah
cuma dua orang tu jer
not sure I remember dua orang tu jer lagi sorang tu I tak ingat pula wait ah I see I got I send you the picture right
cause kesian
mana eh nama dia oh ni oh dia dengan okay lah
sorang tu jer lah that's like really bad
tapi tira punya group macam best cause she got
ah cas dengan tarvin
cuma cuma sorang tu jer yang macam eh sikit
alah dia start march kan
march kita start tak tak kita start intern in march
ya march sampai july
adoi so kau kena your intern has to be there lah
orh boleh kerja ke tak
ah err january tapi
dah prepare I mean they are preparing but I don't know how much they can prepare now that cannot ah selangor tengah kan
dia macam I I asked my mum because even dorang punya engagement pun they postpone
so I asked my mom if it's still uh is still like enforce at that time and tak boleh nak buat tak boleh nak buat kenduri
my mum said nikah jer lah dulu and then kenduri we can think about it later
ya tapi dorang dah ada lah dewan apa semua they have already corresponded dengan that person for now they are planning as if there's gonna be an actual wedding
aku rasa but but because
err we know the guy we are friendly with him ya I used to do it with him so aku rasa macam I don't feel like
ah apa I don't feel like I'm losing her lah sangat
ah and then he's nice I mean we argue a lot tapi kitaorang gaduh manja manja jer because I think we have the same like almost similar personality
ah it's like we are both the opinionated and then kitaorang memang minat benda yang sama like we
apa semua so I can talk to him lah about and he's very friendly even to my family
mm casually talk to him so it's nice tapi macam you know my sister getting married
the last one tu supposed to be lelaki but
keluar perempuan so dia tak balance
but I'm grateful because I am right now macam paling rapat with my younger sister
because you know being the youngest she matures a lot more than kitaorang
form four lepastu tak tak matrix
dia adik aku yang last tu dia sorang jer dalam sekolah
kita orang semua dah ni dah
yang aisyah tu
pasal yang atas dia laki eh
tapi kalau kau tengok the difference between my sibilings I always post their pictures

oh tapi rambut dia sekarang dah tak tegak dah rambut dia dah leper a'ah comel gila
I don't know I miss them cause dah lama tak jumpa
best dia makan semua benda especially fruits
dia basically kau suap apa pun dia buka mulut
and then kalau macam my sister duduk atas kerusi kan pastu dia kat bawah and she's like she's standing then my sister holding a fruit and then dia akan tries so hard untuk panjat my sister's legs
adoi tapi dia dah pandai lah main and then she doesn't like cats like you
she's scared of cats kalau kitaorang video call kan and then I'll be like meow meow then dia macam huh where's that coming from where's that coming from dia takut then sekali kitaorang nak kasi dia pegang kucing dia pegang dia peluk aku kuat kuat gila she's so scared

baru aku pergi ah
bodoh seh
sedih oh dia macam like kau faham tak faham the question I give you one more chance I had to like balik and google apa ni aspiration aku tak ingat aku macam something like oh I want them to be inspired and ah like push themselves like for their art and creativity and with their talent set or with the skill set that I have I want to pass it on to the trainees
penat penat seh asyik kau kerja
bila kau start kerja baru ini fourteen december berapa minggu jer
excited the place is near your house kenapa tak mana kerja aku cause di sini sia ada macam some kind of progression
kau dah buat berapa lama di tempat ini wow that's fast ah
so moving back into like your um cakap siapa tadi
bila dia orang boleh masuk singapore
apa tu barang fashion ke barang household rumah ke barang fashion jenama fashion orang keluar masuk kedai kenapa apa seh
orang beli bag warna-warna buat apa
so I was I was sleeping and thinking about it and guess what when I was half asleep I paid for that freaking app that was so bodoh of me it was a yearly subscription of sixty something I'm so pissed at myself for like the I paid for it so why would I want to cancel it correct
that was so bodoh of me
later you help me out tolong aku I seriously feel so bodoh realising I bought an app when I was half asleep
really really except for those who are working shifts and dekat the
finally after so long of working shifts penat seh kerja shift
bagus berharap kau boleh stay kat this job lama I find that
I noticed that your previous job I mean you worked well but just that the company closed down ke apa ke and it's always like unexpected suddenly
dia cakap besok semua try to avoid going to town in taxi all that is going to be packed eh I thought people stop to go to retail shop to buy stuff
but I think my weakness is makan asyik pergi makan jer as much as nak buat melipat kan macam need to plan for the week
I think the intake is only for like ten days worth ah I think kena makan for like tiga bulan atau empat bulan untuk the
fifty dollars for the um the therapy and then thirty dollars for the yoga therapy so the poses the yoga poses that they taught me was more for menses punya routine to relieve menses tu
I think I will show you later later I forget and then for treatments lah this thing because my next appointment is in january which is like what lagi dua bulan
but but dia cakap kalau boleh makan more sayur-sayur but sayur pun kalau bagus like asparagus don't eat mushroom I don't know I know right I have been eating mushroom cause I thought they was the easier to eat
and then like avoid potatoes but sweet potatoes is okay no milk I mean I'm lactose intolerant no spicy food pedas-pedas tak boleh you know I feel like your body tell you already what you can or you cannot accept right so we will all along I know that I cannot eat pedas punya makanan because I will just go to the toilet
to shit yes of course yes that and then I will go to toilet susu pun sama but apparently one I think a few years ago at my business partner house lah we all cook this interesting dish lah so it tasted like those kung pao chicken so instead of using santan the coconut milk we use greek yoghurt
so it felt like and then the spices that they use macam make up for it macam it looks like yes something like that but I think it's like purely indian food interesting
actually kan I've been wanting to eat more plant based because it's good for us yes I mean yes for my dad yes the kidney issues and then the diabetic I mean I read some articles where people go plant based um their kidney macam feel better one of it is a friend of mine uncle dia kan macam quite a high stage diabetic lah then he had to err inject insulin
inject insulin everyday and then when he changed the diet to like plant based within the next six months he didn't need he don't need the insulin anymore so it's like our body got a lot of like macam too much meat from then
so I've been wanting to eat more plant based just that cara nak masak pula because we are so used to like masakan melayu masakan wastern yes rice is a staple but there are other form of carbs what other vegetable have all have carbs fruits also have carbs is just a matter of taking which one and some buah-buahan
too manis yes but some buah got higher natural sugar in it I can't remember need to refer to the list
nasi I makan nasi basmati so
penat because kerja satu hari bangun pukul tujuh lebih pukul enam lebih keluar rumah pukul lapan mana tak lambat three thirty ah menahan menahan taxi
I was stuck at home apa tu actually aku aku mahu see yang tu juga mm mmhmm
I know right you always take the bus early or late oh earlier lama dia then what did you do take train
creamy meatball are there any other sayur inside your bowl
wow mana ada ini oh I don't remember adding the ice cream
yes but I don't like the place ah I don't like the inside ah so busuk cause I sat near the kitchen so sempit
benda leceh saya nak buat actually
buat basic cause meal prep can be interesting if you know how to do it well
nak perlu impact oh habis kau tak pernah pergi rumah dia
kan lepas tu dia cakap macam kind of um okay no
masa itu masa itu emas time is golden
she ask me that you haven't kahwin that time I thought you kahwin already then she ask kat apa
she say that time I fall down only I kahwin next year aku kau
want to be what dia cakap
who's that siapa tanya
you have to plan lah all the content but there are some influencers right when they post something ah you are so convinced to buy the item wah the person say bagus ah this one okay ah I try also
maybe they are selective lah yes yang macam cakap boleh bagus
but I think nowadays if you want to do your own side business food is always the easiest people like to pay for food makan sedap jer then what about those like unhealthy
I don't know what to eat tomorrow for lunch asyik-asyik makan sandwiches but the one from seven eleven stew apa I mean it must be strong in kimchi flavour
kenyang tak why you heat it up a warm meal then how does it taste like when it's warm really
it wasn't that bad but okay lah yes ramen spot is the best like kat mana opposite lau pa sat kasih area gyudon
poke bowl I don't know salmon what did you eat at lau pa sat yang dekat lau pa sat itu is it like the soy based or the miso based or
I saw that I saw the person macam mana dia apa sushi cake eh the salmon cake savoury cake savoury sushi cake yes is like a decorated cake but it's like all salmon mentaiko all savoury I feel we should have that for our next birthday
it's filling ah kenyang ah
pucailok the long bean with like asam I don't like the corn just the long bean and you eat it with the you know scrambled egg like the side nasi you how about you
um fifty betul
so maknanya kalau uh kalau if you yang in ten years time memang you want to be in an area yang ada laut yang ada greenery where
kalau untuk saya for me eh I think eh
I would like to live in my own lab atau garage
and maybe sebelah would be my like lab apparatus ke apa ke
so if I have my own lab I would probably uh maybe add a telescope atau like some meeting devices so that I can
mmhmm betul
katanya if say let's say you were
martial arts gitu
uh any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and um I think it it it gives me like macam
yang satu orang ni uh she was actually uh she was actually trapped in a spaceship
computed her body into into a technological uh into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone ah orang sendiri tau so
so the boss memang memang jahat ah gilanya orang
like their their image you know what I mean faham tak ya so an image of them self you mean nak ah macam
ah ada fit body atau good looks
I think I agree on that lah sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun eh tapi kalau macam if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then buat apa lah
ya so I think for me kalau ada fit body is more satisfying sebab
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world lah sebab without without health actually um you can be bedridden and even the the cost of uh
so macam I think health is very important lah sebab without health memang you tak boleh buat much lah you can't do much actually
kena start awal lah
so I think one kalau pot from having a fit body eh
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind sebab sekarang memang as you can see eh mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth err among the working adults and among um teens
cara holistic lah
I think mental health also like uh stems from other external factors macam maybe overwhelming of
school work atau
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have lah that they experience so um like if you can see like the education system kat singapore sekarang memang very uh
it's very intense lah so like what macam
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and macam memang I've been schooling ah and I think macam there's a lot of
but tu memang
but it doesn't really appease them so I think macam apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but uh everything has been changing and revolutionised
uh it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless sebab apa tau if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you macam just just kasi semua on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
macam apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics lah and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion bila macam
macam susah lah kan
mm okay so contohnya like for now eh we are in the twentieth twenty first century
cuba like for example eh you ternampak a time capsule
I think that's pun what I would really macam really cherish enjoy
I don't know maybe zaman rasulullah atau dark ages ah cause um basically the dark ages were macam a period of time
the macam
rolab and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science bila there's this two brothers
I think it's very interesting to see macam
the the progression during that period of times sebab sebab during that time memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan idea macam gitu
during the golden age and I find it really interesting sebab how their mind
even in engineering and science and uh it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's um macam kita jarang tengok ah
dalam dunia ni sekarang tau most of the time kan kadang-kadang macam contohnya eh I have to um contohnya I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine uh philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once lah but I think macam ya I think it'll be very interesting lah kalau you can like learn
tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita just go far
sebab ilmu tu mana-mana and you can use for ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu
ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa as long as kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik and I think it will be very fruitful lah
um duit ke rumah ke
or war actually can be stopped cause technically um itu lah kalau boleh share but technically like uh world hunger among there are many um palestinians
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID eh macam susah seh orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang now orang eh actually tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada no access to macam
so I think um having a family really macam
and kalau ada suami I would be able to
find solace in him cause memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan kan so I think having a spouse would be very interesting lah
akhlak yang baik lah
macam I can feel you lah I think having uh having status
even if you want me to have good akhlak
tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal okay kita tak
hancur tau
akhlak is more valuable lah than intellect
akhlak lah actually even if you have your own
buat yang baik lah
you tak ada gunanya
maybe like um what do you think if you macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam superpower
kalau you ada superpower like you nak jadi apa kalau what what what will you like to have right now
kalau ada barang nak kemas inshallah lah
kalau you know I rasa
sebab kalau I dapat teleport kan
I takkan lambatnya cause I'm like always late kalau dapat teleport then macam on on the speed of light or even faster than that uh just like be wherever I want to be just teleport tak tak payah nak passport semua so I think that's very cool ah kalau kalau kalau dapat teleport lah
I think the current technology memang tak boleh lah unless kita ada transporter macam kat star trek ke but of course not lah
tapi contohnya eh kalau macam now's the kalau cause sekarang memang is in progress lah what what do you think of
phones pun is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
sekarang google jer
I think okay lah maybe salah saya juga sebab phone tu memang it serves like an educational purpose lah
ya and the entertainment purpose untuk zaman sekarang
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans ada this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things tapi macam they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very um like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think agaknya also I feel it's on the good side lah because
important I think apart from that I think macam humans should actually still take care of their parents and macam don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and contohnya macam
uh like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then macam mana seh kan
ada limit to it
I think one dia macam pun very subjective lah sebab kita orang tak tahu like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
I think ya technically macam you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world macam india they are very overpopulated kalau kita dah ada robot lagi mana nak letak seh human ni so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult lah sebab you have to find a contingency plan sebab memang dunia ni maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting lah to actually to predict and cause nowadays memang
humans dorang betul-betul kena
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even macam greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see lah sebab um some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser
dekat ke jauh seh aku punya first day ni kerja tempat baru

ah kau jangan cakap kuat-kuat okay jadi aku dari sana rehat aku tahu
uh bagi aku aku datang awal aku check email aku kan aku aku standby talkie kalau ada apa-apa aku akan turun padang lah tapi buat masa ni
ah kau masih ada kan so aku akan buat macam ni lah tapi bila kau dah takde aku terpaksa cari plan B kan takkan aku macam gitu kan kalau tak ada apa-apa betul tak
mungkin waktu rehat aku lah lunch aku satu jam tutup mata no choice ah jadi jadi aku perhatikan kau tahu pasal aku rasa hidup aku ni macam kosong
kosong sebab kau tidak takde seorang wanita yang boleh memberikan aku kekuatan macam kau tahu macam partnership macam mana
aku terus cakap dengan kau lah eh
tadi kalau kau pernah pergi kat one north kan kau akan terlihat seorang perempuan gempal tau kau pernah nampak tak
siapa eh mesti kau pernah nampak dia kirakan uh yang temperature screener dekat sebelah one north security kan
iya lah kat luar station tu lah so sekali hari aku dah pernah jumpa dia tapi dia ni pula kelakar ah cakap dari sini eh dia masih bersuami
ada anak dua tinggal dengan suami tapi dia ada matair lain kat luar matair dia pula dalam case kau faham jadi aku nak kenal-kenal dengan dia pun macam mana ni
suami lain matair lain abeh aku ni siapa ah cina buta jadi aku cakap ah tak payah lah aku korbankan sensasi bontot dia kan aku korbankan aku punya niat
aku tak nak teruskan tapi aku nak tegur dia dia takda aku rasa dia dah tak tahu entah resign ke apa tapi budaknya baik abeh aku rasa umur dia tiga puluh dua tahun
K kita punya segment macam segment segment apa segment rumah tangga pula eh kau ni jauh-jauh seh dari kau punya line
jadi sekali hari tu aku balik naik sampai ke choa chu kang lot one K hujan lebat aku ikut dia babe dari jauh sebab aku kirakan macam dah buang tebiat kan jadi
pada ketika tu aku nampak dia bawa barang banyak tau lepas tu dia belanja tu bulan puasa babe bulan puasa recently
dia nak balik dari dia punya lot one nak naik bus kan lepas tu aku nak ikut dia sekali aku aku tak dapat cari dia punya jejak lah dia hilang tanpa jejak
kemudian hilang jejak dia pun um the next day aku jumpa lagi aku ikut lagi ah this time aku beranikan diri aku approach dia tak silap aku that time oh okay
aku approach dia aku tanya nombor telefon dia ketika dia tengah temperature screening so aku rasa a few days later berapa hari yang lalu
the next day aku jumpa dia ah aku minta tanya dia lah nombor telefon dia lah eh
dia perasan aku bilang dia aku bilang apa yang terjadi lah aku bilang dia saya ikut awak gini gini beberapa hari yang lalu dia bodoh bodoh ingat aku ni macam psycho takde lah niat saya nak kawan-kawan jer takde apa-apa
so lepas tu aku tak kenal sangat pasal dia kita pun jumpa ah ajak keluar makan ah
keluar makan pastamania itu kira bila bulan puasa lah jadi aku tengok dia
so far okay ah tinggal dekat choa chu kang anak dua tapi dia kasih tahu aku status dia ah
so suami dia kirakan okay lah cakap cakap kira cakap pendek kirakan
bawa perempuan tu datang rumah kat atas katil dia kan dua dua terancang lah dia dapat tangkap she came back jadi
dia benar-benar rasa marah kan so aku tak tahu apa terjadi
tapi dia kata demi untuk anak-anak dia masih simpan perkahwinan dia tapi pada masa yang sama dia jumpa satu abang grab ni lah dia naik grab kan dia jumpa satu abang bawa grab ni kan abang tu pula pun kat dalam case nak ceraikan bini dia
jadi masing-masing mungkin dalam situasi yang sama jadi masing-masing pun kantoi mungkin uh masing-masing berpacaran ah for the past like seven eight months sebelum aku nak masuk dalam picture
tapi kalau aku kaji kembali aku lihat eh
aku rasa tak boleh kan sebab apa ni uh complicated kan betul tak
kalau aku nak jumpa dia sekali pun nanti aku pun rasa tak sedap eh kalau aku kalau aku ajak dia keluar ajak makan mungkin aku belikan dia barang ke apa ah kau rasa sesuai ke dia dia masih bekas bini orang
abeh lepas satu matair orang aku ni siapa cinta buta takkan tiga orang dengan satu takkan nak takkan nak gang bang pula tak boleh babe takkan tiga dengan satu boleh gang bang
tak boleh jadi aku rasa macam alamak tak kisah lah kasih dia lepas ah betul tak
aku dah stop jadi apa yang aku buat aku punya cara simple aku delete aku hilangkan padamkan nombor telefon beliau aku hilangkan aku ah buang segala
record record ataupun ah history eh
aku punya message message conversation dan juga eh so that's it so aku tak payah apa-apa ingat ingat lagi
so lepas tu dia pun tak message aku aku pun tak message dia jadi kita pun buat macam takde macam buat bodoh lah faham
aku dah lama tak contact dia jadi dah dekat dalam dua satu minggu lebih dua minggu jadi aku ingat dia masih kat sana tapi ni hari tak nampak
mungkin dia dah pergi tempat lain mungkin dah resign tau tapi kerja dia ni macam ada contract kau tahu macam dia datang kerja dia tu
five and a half days kan ambil temperature sahaja kau faham tapi aku bilang sama dia awak kenapa tak nak cari macam kerja permanent macam cari kerja kau faham macam admin kan so dia bilang aku dia nak ambil security course
aku bilang dia security course aku bilang dia lah dua belas jam tau you awak nak ambil security awak punya anak-anak macam mana aku bilang dia lah kan saya rasa lebih baik awak fikir dua tiga kali lah saya bilang sebab kalau awak kirakan awak dia suka buat event
ah so dia suka macam jual-jual barang kau tahu macam flea market dia suka macam organise tempat flea market jual barang she likes to organise things ah jadi pendek kata dia ni baik orangnya
cuma aku rasa tak payah lah aku teruskan niat aku kan sebab dia satu bini orang
aku tak ada besarkan nafsu babe kalau satu hari lelaki dia dapat tahu eh
telefon aku sorry eh itu siti eh saya nama saya manap saya ni suami nya si
perempuan ni lah eh
eh kau kenapa kau tak ada perempuan lain nak cari eh this thing akan terjadi tau kita tak tahu apa yes walaupun lelaki dia main tiga sekali pun tidak bermakna yang aku boleh kacau bini dia
sebab dia masih satu bini orang masih tinggal bersama lagi satu bumbung tau betul tak
jadi aku rasa tak payah lah aku teruskan jadi kalau dia nak bermatair dengan budak tu yang matair grab dia tu ah itu pandai-pandai dia orang lah kan kalau dia orang kena tangkap dia kena kena kena tanya dia jawab kau faham aku tak nak
ah betul tak itu aku punya cerita
iya lah sebab ni pun datang asal nafsu buat apa kalau kau nak jumpa seseorang tu apa sebabnya kau nak kenal perempuan tu agama dia ke kecantikan beliau ke
kerja beliau ke harta ke kau tahu aku pula dalam case nanti aku cakap dengan bini aku very simple aku berdoa kepada allah subhannallah wa taala kalau benar benar
bini orang isteri aku yang cina ni sanggup berubah untuk aku dia sanggup convert agama huh aku bersama dia lapan tahun berumahtangga tak ada anak dia bayar segala-gala untuk aku aku terus cakap dengan kau untuk pengetahuan kau lah kasih kau
aku tinggal dekat rumah dia dekat condominium kan kat telok kurau tu pun kan eh duduk semua dia bayar
duit rumah dia bayar duit tong sampah dia bayar even macam dulu aku bawa kereta kan sometimes lah bulanan punya deposit pun dia bayar tau kereta tau
dulu aku bawa kereta kan mitsubishi dengan aku bawa C class kan jadi dia banyak membantu aku dari segi kewangan dulu aku pernah ada loan dulu aku pernah
ah apa ni ambil loan sampai sini tau dulu-dulu lah dia bayarkan aku punya hutang dia banyak berkorban wang ringgit untuk aku
tapi aku terbuat silap aku terkenal-kenal aku aku terkenal kenalan dengan satu seorang aku aku bilang kau kan
yang perempuan tu yang celaka tu kan jadi aku bilang diri aku kenapa allah bagi aku ujian besar jadi aku bilang dia okay lah untuk aku menghilangkan segala-gala aku punya keperitan aku malam aku kerja aku lupakan si pinoy tu
aku ada harapan kan siapa tahu nanti next counselling session mungkin beliau dapat berikan aku peluang kedua aku tak tahu lah kan kalau itu terjadi aku akan berubah kau akan lihat aku tak macam sekarang
aku rasa sukar tapi aku tidak menafikan segalanya terserah kepada allah taala jadi kalau benar-benar terbuka hati dia tiba-tiba mungkin dia nak kasih aku peluang aku akan pastikan
ini benar-benar berlaku lah aku rasa sukar tapi pada masa sama walupun sukar aku dah buat keputusan kalau katakan lah aku ditakdirkan bercerai kali kedua okay aku akan bergelar duda
tua duda tua eh aku akan bergelarkan duda tua lah tak kisah lah tua ke pun tak kisah jadi aku bilang diri aku kalau aku dah duda tua tak ada duit lagi teruk jadi aku nak jadi duda tua tetapi ada duit kau faham
aku nak jadi orang berduit kirakan aku nak kena kerja kuat aku nak kena banyak berjimat cermat aku nak kena banyak cari kerja dapat kerja dapat allow tarik tau dapat kerja malam pun ambil dapat rezeki ambil simpan betul tak jadi kalau duit ni dah ada nak buat apa okay aku ada hutang kakak aku bayar sikit hutang kakak aku kasih sedekahkan mak bapak aku faham aku bagi apa kau faham keluarga aku dulu aku nak focuskan keluarga aku dulu
kita kerja ramai kawan betul tak kita dapat kawan jadi kalau kau perhatikan eh aku kadang-kadang suka message bebual sama yasir kau tahu kenapa tak yasir dengan aku pun sama dia pun tak ada bini tak ada matair kan yasir
jadi aku dengan yasir berbual pasal dia punya hidup jadi aku suka yasir dulu aku jumpa robert tapi robert dah buat hal kan sekarang dia buat hal sendiri robert aku rasa

dia sekarang status dia okay lah aku
kata dia dia bilang aku yang dia sudah denounce dia bilang aku dia dah denounce bulan may last year
jadi kira dah setahun lebih lah dia dah denounce tapi aku tahu mungkin dia buat itu kerana perasaan marah jadi
yang allah subhanallah wa taala dan tuhan kita dan nabi muhammad salallah wasalam kita punya ah rasulullah kita punya ini
aku rasa tak jadi masalah aku rasa masih boleh bawa dia ke dalam akram kan tapi pendapat ustaz sana kan dia boleh
ah peluk balik lah agama islam kan tapi mungkin nak kena bagi course lah kan

kau tahu lah budak-budak muda sekarang kan dia tak peduli tau kalau kau dah ada anak bini tau
dia kalau sukakan kau ah dia punya cara simple tau okay lah kalau you suka I
you ceraikan bini you ah banyak macam gitu babe jadi
tahu tak apa dia orang tak peduli tau
ah kita punya masyarakat zaman sekarang very selfish mereka tak fikir ini semua
jadi kalau kau rasa yang kau engkau mesti ingat tau kau punya tujuan sana kerja
kalau ada situasi macam gini aku tahu ramai lelaki-lelaki kat luar sana yang akan
tak ada kan scandal dia orang lebih suka macam gitu tapi aku rasa kau orang baik kau jangan start ini semua lah tak baik kau tahu asal

dia orang akan kalau perempuan tu kan kau dia akan buat ni semua babe dia akan beli kau dengan duit dia orang tapi bila kau dah termakan budi mereka
apa yang berlaku kau akan rasa bersalah sebab aku ada anak bini jadi kau mesti ingat tau kalau kau nak pinjam duit kalau perempuan nak tolong kau kau mesti hati-hati

ah ada plan tengah hari mungkin nak jumpa I punya wife nak makan sama-sama kau bohongkan gitu sudah
itu lah cukup nak kasih dia piss off kau faham perempuan ni
bila dia orang nak bila cara untuk kau macam kasih mereka marah ataupun macam turn off kan
kau sebut nama perempuan lain mereka akan rasa turn off ataupun eh orang rumah kau itu tactic dia
ah jadi kau tanya aku kalau kau kalau kau takde sini macam mana bagi aku eh aku akan teruskan kerja sini macam biasa
aku tak boleh get attracted by your deparute kau tahu asal sebab kalau aku tinggalkan tempat ni kan
aku aku boleh bayankan cheng mun macam mana
he'll be under a lot of pressure faham
kau tahu lah li che tak suka dia
fiona pun tak suka dia aku rasa cheng mun pun mungkin tak suka dia roy pun tak suka dia ramai orang yang mungkin tak begitu suka dengan dia
pun macam gitu aku aniakan dia takkan babe sebab dia dah tolong aku
bila dia pilih aku terima aku bekerja walaupun aku melayu satu jer aku bilang diri aku
kenapa harus aku aniayakan dia aku nak kena support dia
that's why kalau satu hari tadi dia bilang mister see kan kau nampak kan kalau kalau kalau apek boleh tolong
aku akan beterima kasih sebab kirakan engkau pun support aku punya boss
chey syarikat seh kau cakap syarikat macam macam kat malaysia eh
dioye lah sini sini sini punya company ataupun iya lah syarikat untuk your right eh sini punya persatuan ah syarikat company semua ni kan
mereka punya cara satu mereka kalau boleh nak nak save cost ataupun nak kurankan perbelanjaan
dia orang nak kurangkan segala-galanya babe
mereka ada sikit macam apa tu favouritism memang dekat mana-mana semua ada
ah tapi bagi aku
tak ada sebab apa sebab sebab kita punya tu kan mereka dah cari orang tapi orang tu reject orang tu tak nak datang so bagi mereka aku dah buat aku punya kerja tetapi kalau
okay azri nice to meet you again so I just wanna say that kadang-kadang kita ni hidup
memang banyak dugaan life is full of challenges and of course what happens is like
jadi pendek kata kalau kita ni um
uh suka dengan kerja kita kita teruskan betul
kalau kita tak suka maybe dislike ataupun there's push like this then we have to
so in short K kita nak kena tahu
apa jua yang kita buat dalam dunia ini whatever we do here okay
ah jadi macam mana kau nak kekalkan kau punya ah
contohnya tadi aku bilang sama boss aku bilang sama you know aku bilangkan tadi kevin call aku kevin
so kevin came previously so if you saw right I put email dia I emailed him
dia punya request for this um to come down to check look at one eleven kan
was exhaust kau perasan eh so aku nak dia propose based on kita punya requirements apa dia punya exhaust fan size semua lah
so tomorrow he may come down around eleven thirty dia akan turun padang eleven thirty
kita bawa dia tengok tempat itu kan
then boss say kenapa aku cakap because when I try to activate rin cho
he can he macam ah always busy kau faham he got a lot of excuses right and then we he don't want to come then he cannot even give us the required proposals and quotations
so I told boss that I rather do not waste that kind of time and buang masa
tunggu contractor yang tak begitu focus
ataupun yang not really looking for all these things lah so aku bilang dengan boss
ah aku bilang boss ah aku bilang covalent so far is the only company
that have come a few times and then talk to azri and me about what they need kan kau ingat eh
ingat tak the earlier case about the issue at level nine of tower
dengar dengar dengar they are the only one eh that give the proposals for both the air issue and the and the motor you notice
they are the only one tau even Y&T tak kasih eh Y&T belum kasih
Y&T kasih yang dulu punya kau ingat ah Y&T kasih yang lama tu yang kita pernah reject alright
Y&T belum kasih tau ah abeh tu aku nampak ah kai long ada kasih motor oddly eh
air asia tak kasih lepas tu ah ray choo belum kasih abeh tu company C belum kasih
kau bayangkan tau of all kita punya contractor lima company
ini covalent one company can give us that two proposal tau and it's only company kau faham tak
kenapa wani tak nak kasih so it means aku nak kena gunakan dia orang punya specs
nak kena call lagi invite quote for the other company lah that's what aku nak kena bikin later
mana covalent
boleh ah kau tengok kau tengok proposal okay bagi aku okay not bad
dia propose bikin asia semua kan boleh
can be done ah so aku nak kena minta dia orang so whether they want to go or not itu masalah dia sekarang kita nak perlukan we need lagi dua quote betul
ah lagi dua quote kita perlukan lagi dua quote untuk aku bilang kau eh aku macam nak minta lye kasih kita quotation sia untuk aircon works kalau dia boleh bikin
lye boleh
lye lye lye lye ini tau takkan tak boleh
kau cakap orang ke melayu orang putih ni kau cakap orang putih ke melayu nama dia orang putih cakap betul-betul lah
bukan ah aku belum tanya dia lagi tapi aku rasa macam nak panggil dia orang sebab
aku tengok eh macam rin joo
dia kasih kita proposal kan dia rin joo belum kasih tau dia punya proposal I will write to him again
so far I've not really okay you see eh aku tak tahu what was the arrangement before my time
tetapi bagi aku aku still akan invite dia to quote for whatever that he needs to quote lah correct
sebab the idea was given by him correct pasal itu motor correct
so ini semua aku nak kena standby dia punya argument aku nak kena standby any email dapat nak kena tembak email sebab
every month care pax kita nak kena update alexis tau apa dia punya updates kau faham
takpe I will just send them another invite because I'm going to send invite to beberapa contractor jadi I want to see how is ah their
response and memastikan mereka boleh berikan peluang aku tak nak satu hari nanti mereka cakap oh aku penat-penat turun padang I came all the way down meet azri and rasyidi
I gave proposal tapi yang dapat kerja orang lain aku tak nak ini punya cerita
kita dah berbual selama empat puluh dua minit alhamdulillah jadi tak mengapa
okay back to eh kau tahu tak kenapa perempuan korea eh kenapa aku suka tengok zaman sekarang kan bila aku kerja ni kan kerja malam

aku nak cari korean babe kalau kat korea bagus juga eh macam boleh
kenapa kau takut huh
tapi aku tak minat lah dia orang sombong ah babe orang-orang eh semua tak payah lah lebih baik kita ambil orang kampung babe
okay lah diam tak diam jadi tadi kau cakap pasal itu case pasal ini rin joo jadi kalau I will just email him
tengok dia punya reaction if he wants a job then dia akan datang then dia akan datang dan ambil kerja tu
kalau he kalau he gives a good quotation then I mean should be okay if not terpaksa dia akan
ah dipulangkan
ah yang semalam so ah
no no not meter out ni remember dust the dust the diffuser ah so they just want to see the air issue so just show them the air issue because I told them ah aku bilang dengan dia orang
ini tak kena mengena dengan kita tapi aku cakap nevermind kau just tengok kita punya issue you see our air issue
ah kita part kita dah maintain lah jadi tempat kau orang nak kena buat sesuatu so
we just let him know that what have been done and what required by the tenant ah faham
ah aware aware aware ya he will tell victoria meter punya cerita very simple as per fiona's permalas fiona said
this one install okay lah noted noted I not sure I'm here I'm only here six months I'm not sure so dia cakap
ah kata dia lah so okay lah so diam tak diam kirakan yang yang suruh rosakkan
so that is the arrangement lah so tomorrow si covenant turun
we have to focus on this O one eleven exhaust kau tahu pasal
ini benda eh we really need to get the quote soon because richard dah tanya orang pun dah tanya
because ini beruang punya madam F kau si xie
si gemuk tu kan dia nak handover bulan september tau
he wants she wants to handover in september like that kau faham
ah place ah so mereka dia ada plan yang
hebat lah untuk dapat tempat tu tapi
she got some requirement kau nampak there's some that you saw the email I know did you saw
top up dia punya cement twenty five add twenty five
lepas tu half of the probing
then number dua dia kata apa dia nak apa tu then they want to put the
nak letak gas outside lah then they want to puncture to our it is like good to have aesthetics
ah dia dia kirakan they want to do a lot of things okay but but whatever they do
to the centre of the place that is dia orang punya ah so called short floor lah correct
jadi ah twenty twenty five tau look
lepas tu dia orang kat atas ada big kitchen so that the other half eh all the way to the end of the unit is dia orang punya area ah
ah itu naik atas ah naik naik nak naik tu mesti naik punya
tapi kalau kau tak nampak tak obvious ah kan
depan depan the shop front front would not be affected yang belakang dia akan itu
ah they won't akan affect lah because behind they have to put some
ah frosted glass ke apa they have to do something to cover the behind ah
tapi dia orang ada intention nak letak itu gas cylinder itu sebelah kanan
the dia punya piping dia cat warna putih tembus kita punya ah cladding tau masuk dalam above ceiling
toilet eh dia orang kan most likely aku tengok dia orang akan convert sebagai store because dia kata dia tak nak dia punya staff gunakan toilet tu
okay lah I mean tu dia punya hak kan it's up to them
then they can dia orang boleh convert tempat itu untuk macam tempat simpan barang-barang lah
ah to me okay lah I mean as long as dia orang bikin

then um like a few days later like he had a bad he got bad news that his friend meninggal
ya that's one thing like okay I'll give him space cause like you know orang tu baru meninggal kan
aku tak expect kau to be like
I always confront him when like I feel that it's too much or something I always confront and I always tell him macam
like at that point in time aku tak cakap apa-apa cause
honestly that last conversation kan he dia minta maaf cause um dia tahu yang apa macam
he he knows he's in the wrong ah kirakan then he apologize then I was like okay since you apologize you brought up the matter yourself pe so I included my own thoughts about that matter ah
over that maybe my words or something I don't know lah but it's just like macam I feel like he could have
if kalau dia datang balik kan
I don't know kalau jodoh jodoh
it's not fair or tak boleh ah macam what the what the hell is this but at that point in time I wanted to confront him about him not talking to me but at the same time I'm like but he's mourning his friend so I gave him the space but I occasionally check up on him so

ah tak tahu ah ni empat halalnya investment ah basically ya and I need to have like twenty K at least to
takde tapi ni ni this ah ni tempat kan macam ni nya investment ni agent tak dapat commission tau too kind it's too kind because last times a lot of agents are like promoting I think they get a cut ah but now they don't have so like they stop promoting because they don't get a cut
ya err so aku macam aku macam sekarang macam tengah fikir aku punya lima tahun punya
ah aku punya lima tahunnya plan so aku akan jadi tiga puluh lima tiga puluh lima so sebelum aku tiga puluh lima aku nak um grow aku punya
um side sebelum aku beli rumah and
err side uh aku ah yang yang ni ah yang adam adam tengah buat ni ah ya so ya tu aku nak ada kerja yang aku boleh duduk diam-diam
so aku macam focus kat sekolah-sekolah sebab sekolah-sekolah aku rasa that's the best ah it's the best to macam retired jadi designer lah ada aku sikit hari err apply ni UNICEF eh UNICEF pula what it's called err bukan UNICEF yang apa college entah
ah tapi aku tak rasa aku dapat ah sebab err dia punya position is graphic communication and design
aku lambat mm first one first nya aku bodoh
ya I I dia nya dia nya summary and stuff ah cannot aku tak boleh aku stress
uh sekarang dalam kau nya sekolah ada macam ada macam dorang adopt more uh
apa err kirakan malay>macam tapi bagi kau sebagai cikgu apa pandangan kau
macam kau tahu kau punya kau punya is like uh berapa banyak students pass
but like kan dia macam buat macam barang-barang
barunya system dia buat barang-barang lebih menarik
ah mana mana kita boleh menerima seratus dua lima
apa apa kau punya plan
ah volunteer next week lah dia start tak tahu lah apa dia buat but ah like I told you lah we we started with the orientation online because sekarang we are still in the phase
copyright copyrighting untuk uh tak tahu apa lah dia punya social media punya page lah
tak pergi mana-mana lah this is online because right now we are still in phase two um so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society punya volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because has strict guidelines sekarang uh because people you know cannot meet
tak tahu ah all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online sedih engkau kau tengok
can do lah macam so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for macam design uh photography
uh they have macam a knitting crochet with the patients but sekarang takde lah pasal you know it's it's uh only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things ah cancer society they've been around for a long time jadi so they they're very established in the community
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously susah
um but they tried uh I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is uh the apa tu nama dia awareness uh campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these macam cakap cakap pasal
uh ramai orang macam takut nak buat cancer screening because of course takut lah macam people takut nak buat cancer screening
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot lah ya so macam gitu lah ya I'm looking
forward to it lah honestly something I've been wanting to do for a macam dah lama gitu so uh ya inshaallah I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
no next week they will give me the um they have something in mind I think uh ya and then macam I'll just
tengok lah kalau kalau boleh tolong then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
uh but of course they ask that eh no kalau once you commit you have to do it ah bukan macam suka-suka macam this week buat next week tak nak buat ya
you know next year when they start doing uh the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year bila
okay so what they do is on the form in uh apa apa tu during the four main religious group punya holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
hari raya dengan like deepavali
I think now dia tak buat apa-apa lah this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have uh all volunteers come together and kita macam pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have ang pao
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is macam tak boleh afford treatment and then balik rumah rumah macam gitu and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them um like grants and and you know money like contributions uh so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year orang datang like people have to come to them to collect the ang pao um but this may be depending on uh whether or not phase three starts next year lah um I don't know whether that's going to happen ke tak ya so that's next year
kalau tidak boring aje kan buat remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
ya why not kenapa tak boleh
oh ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the uh programs where volunteers kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah tau
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean macam banyak macam program program lah you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya um ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then balik they are both
too penat uh the but um macam especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
kemaskan rumah they showed like one house macam eh kesian lah I tengokkan like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just makanan bawa pergi rumah dia
and stuff like that lah so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have macam apa tu volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
a'ah macam gitu
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract untuk apa kan and it's really up to you
but buat apa ni
but but wait the dogs dari mana
the dogs kat mana
the one dekat
tengah oh ah dekat ya that's true
ini because of the uh apa ni benda ni ah
even with the ini the dogs and the cats
like dog walker pun tak boleh
ambassador ni untuk apa
untuk for like companies lah
ambil gambar apa oh okay
so the fosterers untuk anjing-anjing kucing-kucing like is it is it only untuk the dogs or untuk kucing-kucing also
so when you say volunteer with doing this maknanya you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
like in the in the sense that you bayar untuk semua bende ni semua
so who pays for punya clinic like they have this clinic and they are themselves they are themselves a charity so they have
wow that must cost a lot of money I mean but but now that you said that they have their own clinic clinic must mean that they must be doing okay to set it up macam sekarang dah macam
ada lah duit sikit gitu lah
G O V ni apa
what is the nama oh okay
iya lah charity lah I mean they don't expect the government nak kasih semua orang duit mana ada duit government gets the money dari kita taxpayers as well
sorry the priority number one priority is to the orang-orang
apa masalah if you if the government don't have enough money to macam apa tu cakap
to give macam to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of kasih anjing-anjing
apa punya development
mana kita ada jungle what we don't have any jungle
but do you all know you know as volunteers of uh and working in this working in this uh apa tu dia sector does the government actually have a plan uh when when macam like they go now kat belakang ni like there's this
tengah tengah this new development kat tengah kat belakang sini
do you know do these groups which are know if the government has a macam apa tu cakap
bukan contingency lah tapi macam plan lah like a plan when they develop these new lands
but they've been developing singapore for how long takkan lah macam sampai sekarang tak tahu
mm pasir ris pun ada babi
but how can it be macam gini like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if macam kita baru start nak develop lands or takeover lands it's been macam we've been we've been building
and and other housing since bila kita punya independence nineteen sixties ah
so that's only the dogs because I know dekat pasir ris when I went uh pasir park ya I saw the wild boar was right there in front of me behind the fence
ya because recently kan ada perempuan tu yang kena attack tu
eh kau punya kerusi ni gatal seh
gatal lor
ya but I'm okay I always sit there I'm okay jangan duduk situ
kesian spoke but so what what happens so who
uh tapi it's been there for awhile dengan macam
terus kasih lah I always said that
tapi so when you
okay so I understand because I can see all the apa anjing-anjing kan I can see
and the uh siapa nama tu
who takes care who is supposed to because kat sini I've seen satu just one snake and
apa ACRES
he's a syrian refugee dia tinggal dekat lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways ah cakap macam gitu
so no honestly uh apa cakap ular-ular
it's not as easy as oh nampak anjing oh uh nampak babi we can see it we can you know some kind of action the ular ni you know macam kat bawah-bawah and then in the longkang-longkang you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but eh takut
uh snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about uh ular macam ular coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen satu kat sini
and and then dia macam masuk dalam longkang and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to macam takut uh because I can't I betul betul there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh so
so the thing is dekat here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the um the stray dogs there is a family of three kadang-kadang macam during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
one auntie dia um auntie tinggal kat tak tahu block mana she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that uh dulu dia kena saman because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about macam people feeding uh stray cats or stray dogs but auntie ni sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food untuk she feeds a lot of stray cats macam she brings macam besar you know macam orang-orang macam ini um
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting um for dia dia cakap dia kena
kena saman so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
tak tahu lah auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie sekarang pun nak kena she has to be careful because she also puts out uh
air untuk kucing-kucing ni so the problem is our area kat sini is a high dengue area
what do you mean two hours to clear siapa yang pergi check
siapa yang nak catch
what do you mean walk past lepas tu kena fine tak boleh feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours ni
how do they know macam who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
um tapi kau duduk situ so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
mesti clear lah
tapi dia the feeder mesti clear makanan tu
ah because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and a'ah betul ya that's true
lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia how much is the saman
takde lah mana ada kat sini signs
ya but the the cats kat sini bagus juga lah and honestly the cats around here gemuk-gemuk because of macam auntie macam gini and this
eh apa kat belakang ni there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same kat sini so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute nama dia sausage aku kasih nama jer lah so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
sampai uh auntie kat bawah ni you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window um I can see someone else coming there's another man kat dia tinggal kat I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage ni honestly I've never seen stray cats
I mean uh macam the the
size tu macam comparable to a domestic cat like a cat punya kat kat rumah orang ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of kat sini I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
have run away dulu we used to see more of the dogs
uh during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because takde orang keluar kan
so I saw them dia selalu tidur under the this lorry because orang pun tak kerja so they were like always sleeping the three of them
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the kucing but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one betul I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore uh anjing tak dah takde lagi
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had kat depan ni right in front here there's these two big palm trees kan so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood macam this um once or twice we've seen them along the macam apa tu the park connector here at bukit batok going up to clementi but they came here the whole there were like there first of all dia hantar satu agaknya macam scout came scout nampak pokok ni scout stayed there so I took gambar lah dengan camera tu and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the apa ni I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was dekat apa jalan dekat park connector tu I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big longkang
they are so you see kat sana ada the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is keluar pergi
jalan you know everybody suddenly everybody pergi uh exercise so in that apa tu nama dia longkang the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the animals crossing the path tak ada lagi during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
uh but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop um and they would do their swimming swimming but tu macam exhibitionist tau the otters are huge exhibitionists
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the longkang where did they go to the uh the botanic garden
so they came out macam every night
tak tahu lah
but they're not the ones yang kat dalam longkang ni they're not that big dekat sini kat park connector the one that goes up to pandan
jangan bedek lah kau cakap different family different types lah
what do you mean mana ada clan
macam apa clan
eh kau jangan tipu lah macam mana boleh gini
eh kau macam eh kau jangan bedek lah I mean sorry this is not
like on the ground macam they go and macam nak nak pergi cari
ah okay like like the people who go sungei buloh cari burung cari burung ah okay okay okay
but they all look the same apa macam mana nak ada divide
so the one yang that I say kat sini
during the circuit breaker kan so I read about the one yang
so do they macam pindah from one place to another or when you say dia orang macam this otter clan kallang clan do they just live there atau macam
they come kat sini to look for the
bukit batok clan what what I honestly don't understand macam mana ni
lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana of course you have to look for orang lain kan
lepas tu sekarang macam mana where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so macam do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and dia orang macam what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
macam during the circuit breaker macam okay so that one whole family keluar pergi serangoon road nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa eh when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just macam duduk kat situ aje
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes kat sini in the drain
how did the otters from macam botanic gardens pergi
kat sini like bukit batok because there is a whole we we see a lot in bukit batok at the park connector in the longkang
like do they get tagged by apanya nama dia ACRES
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about macam on social media pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk all the otters knew there was once kat clementi uh near sixth avenue that big longkang
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the apa longkang besar
um but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it macam a new development that they came from somewhere
eh kau jangan bawa telephone kau masuk toilet boleh nanti orang dengar
kau can you please not macam gini this lucah can you please close the door
so ya that's what I'm saying because dulu I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya lah wildlife ya lah of course aware but takkan lah what I'm saying is takkan lah dulu honestly I mean I grew up in kampung we did not hear about all these otters during kampung dulu kampung banyak benda of course we had the monyet we actually had the monyet uh then
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in kampung but we had the big longkang-longkang
so takkan lah I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the macam the public's consciousness
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged macam apa tu namanya microchipped
do they no I mean when you say they care for them bukan macam it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at macam you can't walk the otter
in singapore do they have them macam untuk ular-ular
because I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore kan I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at macam just hiding away and going into the longkang
but how do you macam if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the longkang then it just disappears
oh I I remember dulu dekat the the kat mana tu I don't know what lah it was in the news was it a python
so what happens when ACRES comes when apa the the snake now it has the
kucing the kucing is in the perut
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else kan tak kan macam redhill kat bawah block tak kan you you can't just leave it there
is everything right over sebab
err aku dah boleh sell burgers ah I I I so over here we have darwin salim come do you want to introduce yourself darwin uh sebab kau tahu lah

ida sudah ida ida berjaya call ida ida berjaya membantu orang dari segi emosi lah kan
seramai seribu lebih kurang ah seribu empat ratus orang
ah ah ya sepanjang orang yang berada di di pusat kuarantin kan
a'ah lagi apa lagi ah
oh sebab tahun dua puluh dua puluh kan sekarang kita sudah ada
seorang yang ida bantu untuk dia
a'ah so ida macam bagi dia ida berjaya lah bagi dia semangat untuk siapkan
dia at least dia sudah nampak
at least dia sudah ada chapter one till five
walaupun belum nak pass
okay so sudah cukup kan tak cukup lagi eh
okay lagi satu kan um ida sudah ya lah kita anak kan kita rasa macam
kita nak bantu parents kan kita nak bagi duit setiap bulan
okay err sebelum ini dua puluh dua puluh itu ida dah ida maintain
err ida berjaya maintain setiap bulan tanpa miss
ida bagi dekat dia orang uh tiga angka seorang ah macam tu
so ida macam okay so hopefully dua puluh dua dua puluh satu ini
ida berjaya maintain lah bagi mungkin boleh increase
um macam itu ah sebab sebelum ini kan tak ada duit
pendapatan oh okay okay bagus
tak ada lah kot can
oh dia tak yakin ah
because apa
macam rude dia itu bagus ke
project tak dapat jalan
terlalu painful tak percaya ya
saya um dengan bahasa yang sopannya saya putus cinta
then yang lagi yang lagi painful adalah
err kan so so memang saya tak dapat nak buat apa-apa tak akan lah saya nak
suruh dia putuskan hubungan kan so saya terpaksa terima lah
the most lah kan lepas itu second
second err waktu first
eh itu first COVID ini datang saya rasa macam oh sangat struggle
sebab sebelum ini you tak pernah duduk rumah tanpa buat apa-apa
so then tak pernah duduk rumah selama itu
kan biasa berjauhan dua-dua buat kerja so saya rasa benda itu sangat
sangat menyakitkan lah untuk untuk that okay
yang okay saya dalam hidup kan
so adalah yang rapat kan dua tiga orang
then yang paling menyakitkan tahun ini adalah
a'ah tahun okay dua puluh dua puluh kan
yang dua puluh dua puluh ya like bila kita sudah tak ada kawan kita ada kawan rapat saja at
of course lah kita punya expectation itu
tinggi kan sebab ya lah kita tak ada siapa-siapa so
err untuk tahun dua puluh dua puluh oh saya baru tahu dia kawan
so dia kawan adalah untuk untuk err kawan untuk waktu susah
ah waktu dia susah ha waktu dia susah lepas tu
err saya pantang kalau orang menipu ha saya memang pantang
so ada satu hari itu dia cakap dia sudah balik semenanjung
tapi waktu itu kebetulan saya ada dekat airport
so memang terang-terang dia dia itu ada dekat airport okay dia bagi tahu dia sudah balik dua hari lepas
okay kebetulan dua hari kemudian itu saya pergi airport
so saya nampak dia dekat airport so maksudnya dua hari sebelum itu dia belum balik
dia masih ada dekat sini tapi dia cakap dia sudah balik huh
so memang terang-terang itu kak itu dia okay
so saya rasa kepercayaan saya tertipu lah kenapa dia kenapa dia nak menipu
bagi tahu saja lah a'ah
so saya rasa kalau benda itu
benda itu dia balik eh eh salah
tak payah sebut tempat eh
ya lah benda yang besar macam itu dia boleh tipu uh ya lah dia nak balik daripada
daripada sini naik flight kan dia boleh tipu lagi lah benda lain
kan yang kecil-kecil saya rasa macam
susah lah untuk terima okay lain tak ada kot okay tiga saja
yang saya rasa betul adalah saya buat keputusan untuk saya stay di sini
untuk masih ah berada di sini jauh daripada keluarga walaupun saya cakap tadi
saya punya relationship dengan keluarga sudah makin bagus kan tapi saya masih tetap
familiar untuk di sini berada jauh daripada keluarga jauh daripada
itu lah
kita pun struggle
uh apa soalan itu tadi about decision kan
first ya lah bila saya pilih kat sini then err waktu hari itu saya dapat kerja saya dapat tawaran juga dekat terengganu tahu
a'ah sebenarnya
yang pilihkan itu salah apa lagi ah
okay lagi apa ah
tak ada sudah kot
kan tak ada sudah kot
apa ah
sama saja lah
ya lah someone special pun tak ada lagi
mungkin tinggal house mate lah house mate
dua jenis saja lah
siapa ah
mungkin saya punya mentor dalam business lah kot
okay the business Shaklee kan saya punya mentor
a'ah itu dari segi financial lah sebab dia
err dia manage untuk dapat income err
six figures setiap bulan
a'ah which is seratus ribu lebih ah setiap bulan so dia memang million earner lah
itu dari segi financial lah
okay dari segi
oh kalau macam dari segi ibadah kan benda yang baik macam
neelofah lah kot sebab saya sekarang baru saya follow dia dia punya telegram
a'ah so dia banyak share kan dia banyak ya lah dia dia
dia macam dulu ya lah yang kita yang kita nampak artist kan social tapi
dia punya ilmu macam makin lama makin ah improve dia punya sharing
pasal hadis lah pasal benda yang baik-baik itu rasa macam ya allah bagusnya macam itu
so satu lagi oh seorang lagi ini lah saya punya sahabat lah lelaki
err yang saya panggil dia bapa so sometimes dia macam
err sangat memberi inspirasi lah untuk settle scandal itu macam bersemangat
err oh expect sebab dia counsellor kan maksudnya dia dia punya mentor saya juga lah
so kadang okay dia banyak bagi saya support lah inspirasi
yang tak tahu masa eh ini
a'ah tak semestinya positive kan
untuk dua puluh dua puluh ini ramai lah
sebab dia macam ada dua fasa tau
yang satu keluarga lah sepanjang kan berapa enam bulan kan
so dengan family so dengan dengan parents lah dengan parents
dengan anak buah dengan parents dengan mak ayah anak buah dengan kakak
dengan house mate lah ah itu lah
oh okay ya apa-apa nak duduk call
oh dia orang memang influence ah
kalau kalau macam family tak ada lah influence sangat kan
itu macam biasa saja lah okay kadang ya lah kadang kita yang sendiri minta
dia orang suggest apa-apa kan so tak ada lah cerita-cerita mengarut sangat kan
so cuma kita consider lah kan
tapi yang paling adalah bapa lah itu dari dari segi semua lah
pasal saya punya kerjaya saya punya financial
lepas tu ah pasal kehidupan lah
ya so mostly yang semua nasihat semua ida ikut eh ida ikut saya ikut
okay sebab saya ini bukan yang jenis orang yang baca buku
menyalahkan a'ah
ada satu buku ah buku ada satu buku ini ida pernah baca tajuk dia walking tau
ya lah ida tak ingat sangat isi dia tapi ida ingat ah buku itu
buku warna hijau kan dia nipis saja buku itu buku itu banyak cerita pasal ini lah
pasal kegagalan lah so macam mana dia bangun untuk terus berjalan
aku kena cari balik yang ada tak so apa lagi ah
okay ada satu buku ini buku cinta tahu
bukan dia macam buku romantic lah ida cakap tajuk dia I love you
buku itu tebal sangat ah buku orang putih juga
um I tajuk dia I love you so buku ini
um oh dia dia macam flashback balik uh uh penulis dia perempuan lah
dia flashback balik apa yang berlaku sepanjang dia bersama dengan kekasih dia
a'ah so err saat kekasih dia sudah mati kan
lepas itu dia tapi perit dia dia dia sudah tua lah so dia memang sudah spend
err so dia dia flashback balik daripada zaman dulu macam mana dia kenal macam itu lah
so kadang dia dia macam
okay before before lelaki itu meninggal lelaki itu sakit tau so before itu dia sudah
okay dia isteri dia dia memang err sangat dependent pada suami uh kekasih dia
ah so bila ya lah orang putih biasa lah kan tak kahwin so
dia sebelum oh dia sakit dia sakit lepas itu dia makin critical so
dia macam nak ajar uh perempuan itu untuk berdikari
so err sepanjang sebulan lebih dia banyak menulis
so macam okay dia dia akan tulis dan dia akan simpan note note
dia dia tak tulis dalam buku tapi dia buat note macam sticky notes dia tampal dekat situ macam dekat
ah mana-mana lah dia suruh do eh dia tinggal notes ah
lepas itu lah bila suami dia meninggal so dia nak buat eh
bila kekasih dia meninggal so bila dia nak buat itu dia akan jumpa notes itu
a'ah macam itu so benda itu
dia dia tulis lah buat macam flashback kan ah so dia rasa macam
oh maksudnya walaupun kekasih dia sudah meninggal tapi benda itu ada ditinggalkan so dia rasa
ah macam itu ah banyak ah a'ah lepas itu sebelum dia meninggal tu
err macam bulan depan akan birthday perempuan ini
so dia tinggal lah something yang perempuan ini boleh celebrate
ah macam itu sangat sweet a'ah
so dia sudah tempah orang hantar bunga
okay macam itu ah dia sudah prepare so ada lah note dia yang dia tulis so perempuan itu rasa macam
memang perempuan itu sedih tapi dia dia dia dia mesti dia sudah accept
so dia hidup bersama dengan lelaki itu walaupun lelaki itu sudah meninggal ah sebab itu tajuk dia I love you
gitu lah
yang to do
tak ada akak buku tak lah baca buku sebab sekarang kan
tak ada buku ini buku ini sebanyak kan online kan so so sudah terlupa macam itu
ya lah kalau tak lah kan indonesia buat macam itu sekarang kan
okay satu yang paling ida bersyukur sekali adalah

so sebab kan macam sebab kita orang okay tiba-tiba saja macam itu kan so kita macam eh ida macam
eh gila ah tapi memang betul-betul gila tapi ida mampu untuk bangun sampai sekarang
a'ah macam itu okay lagi satu
lagi satu ida bersyukur sebab ida masih dapat berfungsi dengan baik tau sebab kadang-kadang
macam ida boleh sekarang ida boleh pergi kerja hadap jam kan

so now if they go up one and then the laptop goes up one and then it's like macam bodoh like that you know then now so now it's like macam
macam some of them is like really like very big but hopefully the guy gets a lot of money ah
because they wanted to make the U I like very good and shit one thing about Razer they all always don't optimise their software their software is always macam tahi sia

because it's expensive eh you know COVID treatment there is like thirty thousand sia not like us like you go to doctor with like respiratory punya illness or whatever cock and then like you go you ah apa you go there again you get we pay ten dollars they have to pay for a nonsense amount of money one doctor's visit is like hundred plus sia
quite quite a high amount ah like merepek kind of prices ah like here okay ah somebody sick just call ambulance ah next time can pay I mean at the end of the day it's government run so like
at the end of the day if they are able to like do so much for the COVID punya crisis they have a lot of bank lah so
apa lagi kau nak kan
oh they tutup
ya it's always always like that one it doesn't do anything is more of a macam threat kind of thing
no this is this is called no it's diplomacy it's called like macam firm diplomacy lah or some shit like that
because they keep saying that taiwan is part of china like jangan world lah bro
and then like they are not under the world health organisation punya data list because they are not listed as a country
that one that one that one really rabak sia
no now it's worse because of COVID now you know malaysia lockdown you know ah ape tu

so he's like then I message he message me boring ah kat kampung aku nak balik main computer
apa then I like I didn't know that time that was lockdown I found out from him it's like ah lockdown balik then it's like ah lockdown sia
they all busy fighting each other also so takpe ah
like the Shell there and that's it then like macam boring eh macam
ya but can is can ah but malas
like ni semua nak tak nak
tapi to me tak nak dia lebih ah so tak nak ah
sad sia all the green ah all the green punya policies that obama put in place all gone
he got a lot illegal shit that he has done he scared kena indicted
that's how he won the millennial punya vote ah eight years back he was one of the first few politicians who was actively like in
come on look look at michelle obama all very ya quite influential in terms of macam presidents
because she's one thing because she's a woman lah and women of colour is another thing and then she is like not not not like black like she's like latino ah and then another thing macam she very fierce
for the benefit of the people you all don't want then you all macam
no the thing is dia world and then people still believe him I like sial ah and recently his rallies all the people wear mask wear at all but when did he ever come out with a negative test
like sometimes they ask celebrities like especially macam controversial issues lah
pissed right he got angry he tweet out and then he say because of the fake news media I will release the video first before the sixty minute come out then I like that's his hit back macam you gonna release it first because he wants to say that macam they gonna portray it like differently but then macam
tak kan they repeat the loop and you didn't realise in one hour right
ya I mean if you say you love the bible right it's like saying you love the quran oh which surah you like you know then you like oh I don't know man like it's private then I'm like
ya no the thing is like no I that people oh ya there was one one guy you know there's this guy that time macam oh who you voting for like that time what he does these interviews with trevor noah like he does these interview at trump rallies and ask all these questions about conspiracy theories and whatever shit lah
so that time he was asking like oh ah ape
ah who are you voting this guy ask lah like this random trump guy like so are you voting for trump this year he's like ya so how how's your uh what do you do for a job then it's like oh no he ask like macam how's your how do you think trump is affecting the economy oh is
or all these like or ape
ya lah so you just camp at the nurses punya houses then you wait
oh dia on dia tidur confirm dia on tidur punya
can cancel you you need to pay or not that time tak ah
dia punya waiting time dah justify the thing ah
ajak fight ah that one ajak fight
online ah then tidur ah then eh dah setengah jam
okay kita start hari ni pelan pelan
ah tak tak
dua jam memang ajak fight
it's like it's like the you know there is the apa tu the video the guy Deliveroo at he didn't want to go up the stairs because this apartment had no stairs
ah that's why aku macam bodoh sia jangan sia like oh my god that's why
I'm going to complain complain man mm you ain't coming down macam sial
perangai asshole sia
but but Deliveroo is like that ah memang the
but macam if there's a lift and then you got an excuse lah
tak pe ah become the cashier ah buka sendiri you know take out the cash
I would mengamok sia like fuck you man
jangan bodoh bro
semalam aku try main twenty then uh it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be sia
starting then you straightaway cam dia kasi kau options nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni so everything was macam flow after flow after flow after flow okay
semalam aku try main it's not like that sia
so ah apa tu kau dah create everything semua once kau dah start the game yet and everything and whatnot kan
apa tu positional positional training tactics kan they give you multiples multiple apa tu
tactic kau pilih sendiri
so formation apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri
no that that is still lah macam they give you pre-default uh
apa style kau nak main in that game for your players to play kan
can depend lah so let's say this game kau main tiki-taka four three one
then the next game kau nak main gegenpress four two three one pun boleh
yang gegenpress tiki-taka is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink kalau these two tak interlink
kau nya formation tak leh work
tak boleh ah tapi kalau kau buat gitu
it also depends on kau punya team punya apa tu familiarity of the tactics ah
ada ada ah
wah itu aku belum check sia actually
but yang what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense ah so macam ah there's this one player dia punya role is a central midfielder
macam their own behaviour in the games lah how they will react in the game ah
but then most of the minor minor leagues ah macam I see I go to the austrian league ke I go to the
aku balik jer dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus
in the span of apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam sia dorang improve
dah empat tahun sia
kalau tak salah dah lima tahun siol
tu kau masih poly so bila kau masih poly kan uh
tu kau year three aku year one so that means ya it's been five years ah
it will be quite late lah I mean for now kalau kau pergi download epic games it should be free pe
aku dah cakap dengan kau dia free
aku tak check
cause aku tahu
aku nya laptop yang I buy is meant for gaming
NVIDIA ada ada
semua ada ah all settle already
but should be boleh ah cause on my old laptop yang aku nya graphic card is based on intel's graphic card tau
cannot do anything punya
highly on graphic I mean you know nya graphic macam mana kan
kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya avatar nya muka dah macam
ah then after that your players pun lari dia pun macam you you know lah the graphic is
macam mana kan so
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is uh kau nak kena ada banyak data untuk kau nya computer ah kalau computer kau tak ada data then
macam tak ada space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then tu yang problem ah but
if kalau computer kau aku rasa ada memory then
macam slack sana sini in bola aku tahu but I
itu aku tak tahu ah how it will turn out lah but then
you can try at least ah maybe when you play the game then cara player dia jalan semua will be a bit
lag sana sini but on top of that
tu touch
not here not there punya type of products kan then I would see why phone will not be able to tahan by itself lah cause uh it's
it's there is too much detail in one team abeh kau tahu dulu kan kau main kan is just
okay player kau gini backroom kau happy dah sudah
settle sekarang dah tak siol
sekarang kan that player ada ada core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
macam this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so you have to push him into the social league ah into social group kalau tak you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
habis ah backroom kau terus habis ah
they influence influence influence influence terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang
so that means dia dia kirakan macam the senior of the group tau
okay so then kalau kau bring in a fresh new guy let's say uh you bring another senior player from this team masuk your team eh
takde gunanya cause
kau senior kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau junior juga apa
then but before that he was from dortmund so bila dia balik dortmund straightaway dia masuk balik as a influential player
a senior in the sense tapi kalau let's say kau bawa uh young players like mbappe over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there pe
ah so no matter how good he is he still get outlier macam aku punya dortmund sekarang sancho is an outlier
so macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam
it's like me when I was in the navy apa
cause kau tahu players kan dorang ada dia punya own friends ke apa benda ke so then they have their own players that they are closed with macam kawan gitu kan so then kalau maybe
you bring him to a new club yang uh
but then kalau kau ada player macam dia suka let's say he favours uh I will give you buckley lah
okay kau bring him to the club buckley ada then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group yang penting is they join the social group
in a sense lah cause it will affect your dressing room nya happiness ah
so kalau dressing room kau tak happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
so your dressing room nya happiness actually
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september tak salah aku
once kau free install it's free forever it's like uh playstation Xbox membership
kau download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library kau uninstall kau install balik pun the game is still be free
it's not your laptop nya LAN cable pe it's kau punya router nya cable pe
merepek pe
computer kau berapa lama sia ni
no Zoom lag it's not cause of kau punya itu Zoom will lag only cause of kau punya connection
laptop kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak
cause kadang-kadang kalau laptop kau is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I tak I mean
susah lah sia kau nak tu it'll be damn slow ah
that game is very intensive sia data dia
aku on tiga league eh aku port aku buka empat league four players per league eh aku nya computer speed jer dia punya processor speed kan for the whole for the whole game tu kan dah four star
empat league jer tau
tak tahu ah kalau kau nak malam kau nak jumpa boleh jumpa ah malam aku tak kesah
aku balik jer terus aku boleh jumpa kau ah
abeh kau fikir aku familiar ah kirakan aku pun baru ambil download jer semalam
ya I downloaded it yesterday okay aku tak I never touch the app
aku tu dah jumpa kau pe
correct aku download aku jumpa kau after aku kita berbual semua and everything aku balik dah pukul satu pagi
aku buka tu computer aku tukar cup sana sini tukar tukar tukar aku tidur pukul tiga pagi
there is that thing lah I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab kan yang came out
no kau maybe let's say uh okay cause kau tahu you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad pe so kau boleh remove filter ah hide injured players
merepek sia kau
technically you are apa kan bodoh
ah tu kau nak
eh kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat singapore pe
dulu kau boleh ah tak ada coronavirus you can just go around and ah beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik
kau stuck lah unless they didn't go home they stay in your country ah
ah then gitu maybe uh
kau ada chance ah to play and whatnot lah but if
eh apa tu
maybe if satu hari you go lower than that baru you come out with a semi-pro club
so even if you win games your point kena deducted
until someone else macam you know what
atau they pump atau your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time tu championship which needs five K
but whether your club kat dalam ah the club kau ada loss ke ada profit ke ah there it
tak kira dah cause at the end of day
kalau player kau
ada there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent one was this italian club I forgot what club it was
okay so dah tinggi pe kirakan serie A pe dia up there tau and then
itu lain lah itu tak kira lah bodoh
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist ah terus hilang
nari ada club esok takde club ah gitu ah
so terus takde ah then club dia hilang that's one thing so uh what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan kasi berapa ke
that you know lah some of the fans in this club kan quite rich pe so dorang kata okay you know what aku suka club ni but then sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit okay ah aku pump duit
but ada ada yang lain ah tu really aku tak tahu ah sia kau kena kau kena
cari sendiri ah tu aku
kita ada sia actually
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself apa so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
kita mimpi jer lah tu eh
at the end of day kita semua semi-pro sia
if you're passionate about it then okay pe macam
dah gemuk cakap jer lah dah gemuk tak yah lah
so then macam
tu lah kau baru nak cakap
tak ah
dalam empat tahun jer lah
aku dah dalam dua dua tahun juga tak main ah I mean
sekarang dengan situation gini camne aku nak main bola sia
so what this guy did was dia tak slide ah
I'm in front of you I cannot slide aku tak boleh slide tackle kau kan so aku baring on the floor ah
aku baring jer
terus bola will hit badan aku kau will jump over me apa
aku bangun I take the ball run away ah
aku tak pernah dengar sia orang buat gini kau first time siol abeh macam
boleh boleh cause
takde time kan
ah ya lah betul lah I mean
memang gitu lah I mean apa kau nak buat kan
kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit I mean tengok kita sekarang
no lah yang the apa tu
one thing yang we need to go and find kan is that cup lee hsien loong used
eh tu cawan bagus siol kau minum jer kau tukar kau boleh berbual ah bahasa lain sia
aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum ah kau
dia boleh pe
kau tak I mean the the election before the previous election kan
I would listen to melayu if I somewhat understood chim malay lah I mean kau tengok when I had to go for the interview in malay eh nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye
aku gabra siol
aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing ah so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then oh okay sorry nak kena berbual melayu so nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa word ni eh
takpe aku keluarkan english word ah then I speak english again so it's very
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids macam hari tu aku pergi ah aku gi pancing pe kat changi kan
aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan each other kan they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu cause dia berbual english kan dia nya english was
better than our parents lah in a in a sense lah cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so aku macam
okay ni budak melayu and then budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu
melayu is a first language english is their second language
so there's a chance bila kita dah tua
kita tak akan ingat any other language except for
but then you weren't in malaysia apa you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
for example lah kita tak tahu berbual melayu at all dia langsung tak ada melayu okay kita cuma boleh berbual english
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay pe maybe that makcik was sebab apa tu ah dia belajar
english dengan dari tempat lain then dia forever concentrate dengan english
ah abeh kita tak tahu pe anything can happen kan
ah ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak kan apa gunanya aku berbual kan betul tak
all these old people kalau you actually listen to them talk kan some of them do make sense lah I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time merepek sia dengar
ya sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik
oh dia jiran kau okay lah tu kau boleh buat member
aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini so aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana okay lah aku dah tahu ah
mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal ah hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia ah it can be like that pe
all I see tadi err bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni kan aku sesat uh
aku dah masuk lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there aku stuck dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok
tingkat mana sia dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas then in my mind
correct house eh kalau tak malu sia aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan
kau tahu last aku datang rumah kau bila ah
time kau tau
time kau
time kau CISCO aku tak datang rumah kau tau
ada sekali kau datang eh no there was one before after kau CISCO juga aku baru masuk so time kau datang sebab kita baru keluar makan pastu kau nak
balik rumah kau nak change out to your army uniform and everything to book in so aku teman kau aku datang rumah
then aku lepak-lepak kat living room kau
second time was cause kita nak keluar makan dengan parents aku pastu kau suruh aku datang rumah kau kejap entah buat apa that was the only two times ah
to sit down and properly lepak dalam rumah kau ni the last time I did that kita masih secondary school
most of time aku jumpa kau bukan kat rumah pe
masih ah kau
tak tahu lah
kau tahu kan the situation sekarang kan you've been unemployed longer than I have
teruk siol
singapore airlines now flights to nowhere kau tahu kan
so kapal terbang dia keluar
pusing pusing pusing pusing pusing pastu balik ah tak gi mana-mana
no just to maintain airtime and to apa tu free up ah parking space
cause kalau kapal kau kapal terbang kau tak terbang for very long
it can run down macam let's say aircon you don't use your aircon for very long aircon can spoil it's the same thing with aeroplanes ah
which is why most of their ah apa tu employees all retrenched
kau masuk if you want your things to run you have to on your generators you cannot plug in to a short supply your short supply will not be enough
kau tak leh compare
mahal that's why they
so the apa tu the postal macam okay ah aku nak buat deed good deed so ah aku nak send out
free masks to every household just for free ah aku send out to everybody everybody can be safe
and they no no no no no aku tak approve ni tak boleh masks tak work the masks doesn't work so no
and then some more there's this person they came out with a a mask a mask a proper face mask with holes inside macam fish nets
kau tahu fishing net kan ada lubang lubang tu kan so mask dia berlubang
and then kau pakai so case kau masih boleh nampak mulut nampak hidung ah tapi kau masih pakai mask
ah ye mask doesn't work but then the first
that but then doctors and nurses all have been using it for damn long cause it doesn't work ah kirakan
so dia orang like um
dia orang want to dia orang exit already tapi dia orang nak masuk balik so when they want to masuk balik and then like the security guard stop them lah
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but dia orang like um
they insisted coming in lah and then lepas tu they block the way and then this security guard was like um he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched lah lepas tu dia
lepas tu dia punya couple tak happy lah habis tu dia orang um so like the security guard
lepas tu dia cakap oh like I nak pergi beli uh I nak pergi ambil allen key
ah dia nak pergi ambil allen key lah daripada dia punya service counter lepas tu um
after they take the like they want to take the allen key lepas tu dia cakap eh err please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's dia orang punya pasal lah
err when when they left I ask this security guard lah like you know um like tak kisah pasal dia orang lah sebab dia orang um they they were trying to be difficult lah because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so lepas tu another security guard datang lepas tu dia cakap oh err this couple lah they have a problem lah they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark lah why why
why um why do you err err how did he touch in the first place lepas tu
dia dah cakap lepas tu they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer lah
lepas tu there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
eh tak boleh cakap nama dia
tak boleh cakap nama store
tapi like you are not supposed to eat there lah because
takut you expose yourself to
ya lah lepas tu dia argued dia cakap oh my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
lepas tu we're like no
jadi dia cakap lor you know like um
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down kat rumah and then like melepak tengok tengok youtube macam my bapa so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
oh like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like pahala I'm like sometimes kan you buat kerja bukan pasal pahala you nak buat kerja pasal you nak care for the person you know
lepas tu you tengah cleaning buntut lagi
you nangis
ya lah tapi you nangis ke tak
macam you kasih birth to anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu kind of thing
wow nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa tau
you tahu kenapa tak pasal I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so kalau you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
tapi like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things macam even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like oh I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop lah or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like memang like I think it's just human nature lah like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
tu memang dah macam amanah lah pasal dia sedekah gaji itu kan
mm alhamdulillah banyak rezeki
you macam apa tu um in debts lah
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like kalau is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like um
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean macam like bila dia dia dah nak meninggal kan habis you ada kat sana
tapi at the same time meh pasal dia punya selfish thoughts macam begitu he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like bila dia dah meninggal like you have to live your life and his ah if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to jaga dia bila masa you nak you nak belajar
lagipun dia ada banyak family around here daddy is swag
correct because I mean I understand lah kalau you ada family kan tapi tak close dengan family tu macam like saudara saudara tak tak rapat kan
tapi like um in terms of helping right ya lah like that lah but like like you just have to help your family lah you know
like my um my side of the family is like kalau ada kerja kahwin or kenduri right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup lah blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
lepas tu like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point kan they will like going to get married soon they'll like eh nanti bila kita kahwin uh
kau orang suka tolong-tolong kan nanti kita err kita kahwin kau orang tolong ah this kind of things it's like
I don't think that's how you should behave lah because then you see the core of your personality you know lepas tu like this particular cousins they are like always
ah even when there is a wedding they tak datang on time dia orang datang lambat even the people that they're supposedly close to ah like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin pun datang lambat so I feel like ni apa punya attitude ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin and they're going to breed this kind of
job but err my step mum ada lah tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak then I'm like ya cukup cukup cukup
tapi like I told you before right like my father memang apa macam babi like you know like he fucking like um tengok
tengok youtube every single day pukul
sixty only ya and he watches he watches youtube in the fucking morning and then when I want to mengaji then he on the bloody video damn loud then I can't concentrate you know
after that ustazah he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I ustazah say lah like like you know like
err perlahan-perlahan lah baca lah kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau err perlu err ulang lah lagi tapi I cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main video saya tak boleh concentrate lepas tu ustazah macam awkward lah macam oh okay
for me right my my bapa is
macam pemalas jer gila babi tau
like satu dia like dah lama tak kerja and he's just err waiting for government to give him money
and then like um err what do you call that like dia tengok youtube videos every single day pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh on kuat-kuat until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
um electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar
dia tak nak kerja then um ya then I just keep quiet lah like it's your problem what I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever lah you know
err he got his heartbroken and dia dia nak console lah kawan dia lah
lepas tu kawan dia punya crush
err slept with eh will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me lah I like dia tu bukan you punya girlfriend couple dia punya crush sahaja you you nak sad sad lepas tu you nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam
you nak um act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
lepas tu my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that uh oh kawan dia actually kaya dia macam from a well to do family lah lah lah lah
do you know what my father say he say um oh jadi kalau kalau adik kalau um pergi keluar dengan dia eh nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja coke ke apa ke
lepas tu macam mana you tak darah up kan so I darah up I cakap
kalau nak kalau nak ah jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap
err dia cakap dia macam nak weekend excuse lah macam dia joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
lepas tu what the
ya I mean like fuck man like dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak my father lah dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia lah pemalas
put clothes in the the washing machine and then err gantung which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like kerja um kemas rumah masak lipat baju makingkan dia kopi
I mean mm tapi kalau you old school kan you kerja apa
jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi tau and then I even have like I'm working with a guy um this pakcik he's about seventy plus seventy two
dia masih kerja I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty lah this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to macam kasih dia duit you know what you mean lepas tu I tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab I tengok dia unproductive I rasa macam beban tau like
oh kakak you know err we were talking about how when you die right and then um um
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the bumi right
my step mum cakap dia tak nak jumpa my bapa
ya lah so in bumi you ada mark like husband and wife right tapi in syurga you nak you you still want to be together or not
ah my mum say tak nak myself say
I can see sometimes he's caring but ah as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that macam became geram became macam kau dah lah pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau also nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa
lagipun right half of our lives he never raise us and huh correct dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak expect kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke correct
I mean we don't think like that lah tapi my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap oh nanti err ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit
ya so for me right usually kalau I nak kasih I kasih my step mum lebih macam say
he also likes to count people's money mm macam dia cakap oh like your sister mm dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua like berapa ribu lah
lepas tu he like to compare oh kalau your sister kerja dekat singapore the versus your err brother-in-law who's who kerja dekat malaysia dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that sekarang can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying err meaning macam actually bila kasih I duit macam gitu
like itu yang kasih you marah because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident lah but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right jadi um my step mum yang yang he was refusing to give
because he like calculative say oh you from the kampung you indonesian lah blah blah blah balik kau punya kampung blah blah blah blah blah blah kalau aku tak kahwin kau
like you punya life tak better lah blah blah blah blah
macam gitu sampai sekarang tau dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran kan I tak suka
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you tak nak you nak duit delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother pun macam I rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam my bapa tau like dia selalu dia cakap mm
lepas tu me and my eldest sister we're like kau boleh born dalam poor family tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya problem
allah dah kasih kau banyak avenue untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak blame orang lain
and like err play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged eh and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that jadi I feel like wah kenapa eh like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
tak tak tak I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
so macam I don't know man it's like
tapi sector macam mana
I tak boleh I teach drama and english before
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like oh I'm just contend with sederhana which I cannot relate to
poyo siol
yang you yang you yang you what um apa tu err this this answer thing is it like um it's like a notes for the exam lah
but I would say it's because of err bumiputera but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay mm there's a difference
it's cheap what you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people lah like I tell you before right macam kalau you nak beli benda sana kalau you tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana
I keluarkan lima puluh ringgit I bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk shampoo is tak memadai it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
dia tu yang yang itu lah yang err text you yang tanya is you
ah kau memang dasar orang melayu
kau yang babi eh nak orang putih padahal kau hitam babi
sawo matang oh okay
mm kan you punya suara kan macam abang-abang pun
macam apa number one candidate untuk orang kahwin lah
ah you tak bilang
eh tu tak fair because like how can he choose it's supposed to be the choice of the people
ah nanti you you tunjuk I ada gambar
tapi you tapi you
pergi keluar dengan kawan right like another guy right
kita jadi in ah kita jadi in pasal kita use triggered jadi budak kecil
ah tiga minute lah
tapi um I feel that kalau you excel very real like you will be like top top one top five percent maybe they can offer you like uh there are some companies would like sought you out you know then like um give you accommodation and all that and then get you to stay there to work for them
tapi um
aku dah tak pergi gunting rambut sangat lah macam aku lost

I mean tak lah aku betul juga now now that you now that you mention about err last time when we were in school we
sekarang aku baru ingat balik actually ya lah actually quite true lah macam aku used to
primary school aku dulu kat katong punya area kan then
then there was macam a lot of
macam drains ada banyak longkang-longkang besar
so that time tengah primary school tengah pendek kecil kan so like
after school nanti main bawah longkang masuk bawah longkang then keluar dekat lagi satu punya longkang punya area keluar kat luar jer kan
that kind of thing so a'ah lah betul juga lah so I think
wow jauh eh actually wow hougang sampai bukit batok jauh seh
park connectors dia tampines
ya it's from tampines to pasir ris like a shortcut bagi pergi ya main basikal so
so far if kalau pergi jauh-jauh aku tak pernah aku tak pernah realize seh
ya dah ada ya dah ada

ada ada ada err actually actually tampines street forty five yang belakang is actually connecting
dia actually connected to connected to bedok bedok reservoir err then
nowadays my school is only err usually now is only four days sahaja
now at this age nothing much to do lah so ya quite sian lah like macam like
I thought macam I thought like I thought
macam like seven eleven jobs is easy to get kan but
to work somewhere in uh plaza singapura lah plaza singapura then I can err it's
second they called me they say which ah which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza singapura then
they send my resume to plaza singapura then
they have a different way of macam approaching things lah they
people have more macam people are more more polite lah bila I talk to people
macam really down to earth they they know
east coast apa tu
aku suka pergi oh
I mean aku aku aku not the outdoor outdoor ke type of person lah aku aku tak suka
macam aku aku
err aku tak suka kotor-kotor lah aku tak suka pasir-pasir you know pasir-pasir then
memang best lah kotor-kotor ah but macam the next
day macam hari hari kemudian macam
bila time pagi nak balik you know nak balik nak kena
nak kena mandi nak kena
nak kena bersihkan pasir-pasir you know that kind of thing habis dengan
pagi-pagi buta rambut tak shampoo all that macam aku tak macam
aku tak suka outdoor punya benda because of that sahaja lah aku
oh I mean ah ya lah I think ah aku rasa it's a macam macam macam ah
apa ni self esteem dalam melayu apa eh macam
pendirian diri ah eh bukan bukan lah I don't know what lah sudah macam like
self esteem lah aku
will affect my choices macam aku will affect aku punya
err whether aku nak ikut kau orang pergi east coast overnight ke tak

nak kena pack barang-barang aku semua lah like like
like I've to make sure aku ada ini ada itu ada ini so besok aku will feel
maybe mungkin it's a mungkin it's a penyakit ah I don't know lah but ya lah
ya I think I think I think betul juga ah apa yang kau cakap macam like um
macam let's say macam main dekat rumput main dekat rumput kadang-kadang I mean aku
aku punya mind kan aku dah fikir pasal rumput tu kan
nanti automatic kan automatically aku punya kaki gatal sendiri tau macam
suddenly aku dah rasa dia punya gatal dia macam pasal aku
macam betul-betul ada ada betul-betul betul-betul rumput ini akan menggatalkan kaki aku lah then aku
straightaway kaki aku dah rasa gatal dulu macam
aku rasa ada something ah macam tangan aku pun kalau tangan aku
macam ada sweaty palms ah berpeluh
kalau kalau kalau aku tak fikir pasal apa-apa apa-apa eh
dia okay tau tapi bila time aku
nak start buat kerja something ke apa eh
bila time aku dah start dekat depan computer aku nak fikir lama jer kan
aku rasa straightaway tangan aku berpeluh tau so macam
dia ada effect juga ah macam
aku rasa anxiety problem ah macam
macam oh aku kena habiskan kerja ni
masa tempoh ni then straightaway aku punya otak aku dah fikir oh
dah ada macam jadi rasa takut lah
oh jadi
itu lah asyik berbual pasal aku jer daripada tadi
aku tanya pasal engkau pula lah

cepat lah one masa berlalu very fast lah to me like my masa
a lot dah tukar lah I mean a lot of a lot of changes lah dulu singapore dulu dengan singapore sekarang kan macam a lot of changes lah cara
makin laju everything became became faster
then macam everybody rushing then macam like
aku feel last time was more um
ke time lockdown eh time lockdown I uh lockdown period I think
mm takut tak lah I mean

you know I I I decided to macam I came to
it's not something you can like belek here belek there and like go
and not get caught or what macam
ya betul ah eh I remember I remember those times lah macam
err hopeless lah you feel quite sad lah like like like macam like
macam going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship lah like

ah lah there are a lot of a lot of view a lot of macam views on that lah macam like
will say different things lah macam
like nature nature telling us something ke apa you know that kind of thing so
itu lah we just have to make the best of it lah
ya lah but sekarang I mean um ya definitely macam that time aku baca dekat news

younger person also they would be more like oh a younger person maybe I can hentam ah ketuk this ketuk this
beratur like satu jam dua jam ah but this one
for their own ubat ah they cannot what cannot wait you know you see that's the difference ah
you know now COVID nineteen right so macam banyak
ya I don't want to find like some kerja itu semua
can freelance but I also can like you know I can kerja like under a creative studio or
what should I do because when it's COVID nineteen semua benda macam
semakin menurun so I've been thinking about internship
because I'm I do macam you know the video ambil ambil video kat kat video ah I do like
poster poster buat buat poster but for their events
but it's just that my designs macam I my direction
not how to say ah macam
tak ya bagus bagus design sangat it's just
lesser design elements so macam tak berapa
I were to be versatile or what I think I need to like macam gain experience
closer closer to what I'm what I want to do lah you know what I mean like magazine editorial ke apa ke you know
ya ya but like mm it's a bit hard especially COVID nineteen lah like what I'm saying macam dah dah ada ni penyakit semua it's like it's hard to even go out it's hard to
that are related to my career it's more to like macam survive ah like tak ada duit you know like you know like now like
err I feel quite sad lah like sekarang zaman sekarang our our like generation like
survival ya so you just take whatever lah ambil jer like what else
masak masak kan ah ah masak masak so like even now your I feel like your industry also kena affected mah
what what we the future future contain cause like I feel like COVID nineteen kan kan dia teach you how to humble down and like
around you at the moment so like live the moment you know ya macam kalau you plan your jauh pun then your plan not
go to plan then like you will feel upset something then macam nak give up gitu kan so
I just hope for the best but not too much don't expect too much that kind of thing but like I feel like if we do out best in in anything I think boleh lah boleh lah we can make it lah
ya budak budak sekarang like okay I would say like now there's a lot of like
there's a lot of new things maybe like new food or what that kind of thing like for example bazaar you know this ramadhan can't go like mosque or what
yes it's also affected kan so macam a lot of
and like how to say I feel so macam deprived gitu macam tak ada orang nak cakap it's not that I
aku selalu actually middle actually aku ambivert ah
aku actually ambivert but basically I choose if I want to
like but now I prefer to be alone ah but it's just the people that I macam nak
siapa siapa yang I'm close to I want to just just meet them like okay I have a few other friends with it I think like I'm sure you
ya so macam ya now I'm introverted and I'm not mad about it but it's just that
since we're in our house macam kita kat duduk kat rumah kan it's more like oh sometimes we are so blinded macam
more changes to more ya progress to like macam make singapore more
like the quality semua ke apa kan like more err out there
macam kau yes correct correct
macam tak like tak ramai sangat yang
setuju um I don't know what I'm talking ah but like they don't agree
ingrained already it's like oh eh um aku dah apa I'm already like brought up this way from my
parents I need to be this way that kind of thing so they're a bit stubborn macam
degil sangat lah you know what again but I really hope that
they start to macam open up sikit and then more or less
what rakyat you know caring you know like I hope singapura macam
I don't know economic macam image you know like how macam singapore nak
that like banyak banyak gaps a lot of gaps
so aku lapar sial aku lapar sial like
you know I'm lapar I don't know what to eat also
but it was not bad and I found out that it's actually halal because the the is new
there's no halal sign so I asked actually halal it's just that it's processing the
now you just kau dah apa kau dah shift aku punya ah mindset sekarang to pasta
ya I don't know uh macam dah lama sangat
that one is like kita punya own timing punya break
I'm not a person who'd bangun pagi oh my god
I want to because is it yang mcgriddles tu dah dah
sedap seh I feel it's very nice eh but I'm like
sorry McDonald's kenapa kau selalu bagi mcgriddles macam sikit sikit jer
ya macam betul seriously sia
but uh everytime after makan breakfast I will tend to have diarrhoea sakit perut
the mcgriddles punya I think the heavy one is the egg one
ya ada
boleh boleh ah boleh ah boleh ah tak lah kat secondary secondary
actually I can recall almost banyak ah
I don't know ah chill eh kejap let me think let me think
okay lepas tu
my I join err apa ni floorball
ya macam C division itu semua B division
other orang yang macam dah tahu main floorball
to macam beli stick itu semua ah so I made my own stick
ya I did ah I used macam sapu kau tahu penyapu dia punya yang wood tu ya
but I use a normal you know kiddy ball macam eh kiddy ball
macam budak budak yang kids suka main tu yang bouncy ball
ah I use that as a floorball ball lah then the thing I use use use I play aku practise lah
aku practise practise practise and you know the grip is not nice
floorball stick is softer the grip so ya my hand bengkak
ah I swear aku tak boleh shoot sial aku tak boleh shoot
it will never be a high shot macam shot or low shot gitu so I was so frustrated because the rest could do it
because okay basically kan floorball is macam yang banyak perempuan lawa lawa semua
because they never ajak us ke apa they just let us one side
okay okay tu bagus ah actually
floorball macam collective it's a collective you're in the floorball then you means you're floorball members ah so
then macam okay ah apa set ah then I then I go interview then I like
confirm malam I stay at bedok like jauh kan I was like
that's how I that ah then lah itu lah that's how I ended up in
tapi tak ya I think it's becoming popular because I think we're good at floorball
because I go to I go watch macam tengok tournament itu semua kan some of my friends are in the national team
I don't know like you minah like that eh I don't know why ah I damn scared of you sia
I know okay one thing for sure kau punya idea bagus gila like no joke and some
but that ni but I feel like cause kita tak banyak orang ah tak ah dah tak tak banyak manpower pun ni
points that kind of thing right cause got the apa apa
oh ya okay I feel like itu macam saja macam myth saja it's just to like oh just make you exercise
got music one ah ada music
kau kau join chinese dance is specifically chinese dance saja
bukan ada mix tak
vibing habis sekarang kau tak menari kau tak nak menari kau tak
so sekarang kau macam dance yang K-pop ke apa with your friend ah
eh we should kita mesti dance seh next time
ya but then because I don't know I I'm not good at following macam movement tahu
but kalau free style it's it's no boundaries up to me
but if you had a chance to like like you know like now people do the urban dance get kind of thing maybe like that kind macam gempak pun apa
oh the slow kind ah yang ni macam yang macam you know the ones that the choreography is like
ah kalau hip hop ke gitu okay ah you like you like you
it's that one takes time to appreciate it tak apa tak apa
rugged ah type macam rugged ah
oh tak kisah sangat ah
a bit err just macam sikit ah
then sekarang kau kau nak plan plan pergi university tak
macam mana nak cakap gigs gitu
I need to macam start from the bottom media and not
ya ya ya that's true that's true kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus macam
kau boleh buat banyak benda kau boleh adapt adapt adapt adapt adapt
then kau belajar belajar sekali
but like but that's the thing though I think macam singapore kan dia orang they have like this emphasis on macam
kau mesti bagus at everything but like let's say
architecture okay then you major but nanti they say oh no you have to have good record
now that I think of it last time kan we always macam
oh aku nak jadi orang kaya then when you rethink about it now macam maybe I don't want to be a rich person
under under under under under us lagi you know like this so it's like
ah mata merah
apa bersefahaman eh why is does that sound like a paper kind of
is it tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu
oh cannot lah that one is too gila okay maybe I start first
if I got three hajat the first one would be I want to talk to my kucing
cause because I just like like every time I always like talk to my kucing and then I I become like a gila person and I like berbual merepek I legit like talk like my kucing is my kawan
so if I if I can actually talk in cat language maybe my kucing will talk back to me
but macam fun lah
alamak if macam tu then
but I want to like faham what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
if you get to like pilih if you can only travel to the future or to the past
like kalau I'm given a chance to travel back right I want it to like
just be macam what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya I tak nak apa tu I don't want to travel to the future
cause I takut that if I see macam what my future is
macam I risau lah that my what my actions will
oh ya that's true but okay example lah if if in the future I see that I become doctor and then abeh I I don't know I
okay no no no change change change okay in the future I see that I'm something that I don't want to be macam engineer ke
or cikgu then I'll be like oh okay okay ah try to like then I'll try to do something that won't make me like a cikgu
but actually like in the end also like I don't know then it will affect my like what I'm doing right now lah and then macam tak ada thrill if I know that in the end I'll become doctor then
then I'll be demotivated to study cause I know my future like okay lah later I become a doctor so tak payah belajar banyak sangat
tapi fun lah
cause macam sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my cikgu always say that oh kalau example if you sleep like like okay for imagine if you sleep macam eight hours a day
that means like your whole hidup right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
so he say like just sleep like empat jam cukup lah tak payah tidur banyak-banyak
then I fikir also like betul lah
but if I tidur
sikit sangat also I also ngantuk
ya ya I understand okay how about like tak rasa ngantuk
okay how about tidur sekejap tapi can still work the next day
feel like sleeping legit bazir my masa
oh I faham
makan so much gula
and all the merepek food
abeh I think I think
cause my ibu and my ayah they dia orang got diabetes lah okay not my ayah my ibu
ya I a bit takut but at the same time tak kisah lah
and cut down on the gula-gula
oh wait no maggi goreng
no ada indomie and maggi eh mi sedaap
actually I last time legit suka eh ibumie
ya sedap but then
I don't know why everyone say indomie so I like oh oh okay okay sama sama lah indomie indomie also
the flavour macam lain sikit right
it's like lain sikit
mi sedaap they legit like tak lokek their bawang
but their bawang a bit macam
weird lah cause their bawang is bulat-bulat
it's I don't know it's bulat-bulat and then when you gigit right like sometimes it's so keras
kan maybe it's like bawang but
covered with tepung
so it's just like they goreng the bawang already
oh I tadi I eat uh briyani
okay lah tapi macam apa banyak sangat apa tu minyak
daging I don't like
what the wait they jual where
I I want to like tahu what like what others are thinking about me
I feel like pelan-pelan I will I will adapt to it
and like what you know during the time I go up to to to aqil to ask for the gambar
and then imagine I I tahu what he's thinking
and then legit like if if like he tengah fikir something bad about me I'll probably like okay tak payah gambar then go back
actually takde power yang
yang I don't know
is ada hikmahnya that
um ada udang sebalik ini semua
tak pernah eh
I legit tak pernah dengar
apa eh let me think
if macam if you don't simpan the benda right you won't even remember that it used to exist
then you don't really rasa anything
so maybe sometimes macam lebih baik lah if you don't already have it
what is the one okay wait I read in malay also okay sabar sabar eh
okay apakah alasan yang paling remeh yang menyebabkan anda tidak suka pada seseorang
alasan that is paling like is okay
I can think of one alasan that is very remeh
the alasan is like is that maybe dia orang punya suara is a bit weird like if it's macam you know like if you dengar like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way macam entah eh tak tahu macam mana nak explain
ya faham kan ya tapi like that's macam legit merepek lah
kan kan macam nak sepak jer kan
but sometimes is just macam salah anggap salah judge
ya that's why it's like legit remeh merepek
wah that one I tak boleh angkat also
ya kadang-kadang macam geram nak tolong angkatkan kaki dia orang ke
apakah genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
maybe can macam berbual pasal a recent um drama you watched
you want to mulakan dulu
I think I faham a bit
is it macam
okay it's not really genre lah but okay as you know lah I suka like anime like recently like I watch a lot of anime
like why I like anime is cause the apa tu the characters legit macam cute gila and you know like they're like the the guys
they !alamak! I don't know how to explain they are so handsome
and okay like handsome tu satu lah but and then they they are macam they are so perfect also
ya and ya and macam kat singapore you got like you cannot find anyone macam tu and so like ya lah like anime
it's like very fun to watch cause they are also cartoons so faham-faham lah it's like
ya and some more can beli all of their stickers or baju and stuff
and usually the anime their their plot macam very exciting and very fun lah cause it's not like real life so there's banyak
you can tambah benda merepek that doesn't make sense or something that isn't macam logical in real life
and it will still be bagus
kan macam
eh just ask me I can tolong ask rina also
I added I follow your adik and she legit so funny
oh my god my adik also you know my adik is like like very young
and he type macam legit like budak zaman sekarang like you know you know how you type macam oo whoa whoa
and the thing is he's a lelaki you know so when like sometimes I I tengok they way he type or he hantar me message and I legit sometimes macam a bit disgusted
ya and and his macam ejaan is lain you know like you know when you um eja like no is N O he eja like N U U U U U so it's nuuuuu
ya sometimes you must apa tu enjoy the moment tak boleh cepat sangat lah kadang-kadang we cepat sangat nak grow up then we put in like so much effort
to not macam live your age and then in the end also you regret
you want to bertitik tolak to another question
if duit is percuma then
I want mm I want bubble tea to be percuma
then I can rasa I can rasa all the different flavours
because sekarang I just keep buying the brown sugar fresh milk
you know I baru beli the sandals right
and then tadi I keluar lah I went ikea and apa tu it was like a bit scary cause I don't know I don't know why like when I pakai the sandals it feels like like high heels or something
ya ya and I takut it will cabut so I was like I was like trying to macam walk slowly and it looks a bit weird my mother was like eh jalan betul-betul lah
don't know cause apa tu sebelum tu I had uh one pair of rubi shoes and it actually like lasted quite lama lah
ya cause kadang-kadang it's only until forty
that's a bit kesian
oh oh my god I benci when when like they always look at me like I want to curi something
if it's just what like how I'm acting I think I was acting macam biasa jer
tapi legit menyampah
maybe they kena force to do it
actually kan if they if they tak cakap welcome then that means they just diri kat situ and stare at you so maybe that's why they welcome welcome
oh I did I did okay apa ah I actually just bought like baju
and seluar and kasut ah cause like tak ada banyak benda that I need and I
I'm actually cause I look at my wardrobe and like I got so many baju that I don't really pakai all the time
and it's like I simpan it's just cause I simpan cause I sayang you know I don't want to I don't want to buang
then I keep macam telling myself dah tak apa lah next time can use but
I don't actually pakai it lah so so I like

like your whole kampung can stay there
like you can just say hi mak
dekat sebelah like your mother house like literally dekat sebelah but you get your own house
nak ada apa durian rambutan
it's like so besar aiyoyo boleh jadi gila besar dia
is like must be besar lah kalau if it's like macam
kecil I mean like all singapore houses is like so small so kecil
a rumah sebesar
ah betul juga eh ya how come I never thought of that no but then like susah seh kalau macam
staycation tapi staycation masih like around singapore pe
besar ah rumah dia
so it's not made up of kayu you know like last time like they always made up of kayu
you like kayu or you like concrete
you got stay in kayu house before
never ee kentalnya
you know what they call that rumah panggung
that's why like malaysia I don't know eh malaysia like jarang seh
splinter nanti ada splinter then like mak tolong mak ada splinter
mak kau marah sia
north is like uh tempat macam sembawang ah yishun all the atas atas
what is happening there tak ada benda actually okay if you put right uh
okay you think about dia punya benda-benda yang ada dekat sana
nak migrate pergi mana
or to danga bay ya they've got pool you can just go out of the fray a bit I thought they are both right ni
jauh for what
north pun jauh seh
I think the red line super panjang seh dia punya dia punya line macam never ending
you daripada marsiling pergi
after the next stop after marsiling dia macam rasa macam forever dia just tak sampai-sampai macam
nama dia dekat like if you see the listing kan nama dia
tak tahu ha I don't know I don't what is it
oh ya balestier untuk orang kaya tau
untung lah ya man
landed mahal seh landed
wah so expensive seh I really tak sanggup like
kalau nak beli like the four room lah
ya like I would macam spend the
tak tak muai seh
wah like inflation ini semua inflation
empat ratus something empat ratus million juta no I don't think it's billion billion
banyak kan
boleh rent out
I think can make my own kilang
kecoh sia ya
macam oh aku ada kawan kat sana tak ya
tak ya book apa airbnb ke
and then some more you stay at the like two three storey house seram seh
because the currency also lain jadi macam
cost of living kalau if we kalau kita kerja kat sana
err you can also cause kita like we planning to get at woodlands so it's like woodlands area is just so near to then she say so aku kata like you beli rumah dekat woodlands
err you all err rasa macam you all save enough money to beli rumah dekat err
then you all just beli rumah dekat abeh rent out the rumah dekat err singapore ah dekat woodlands
abeh nanti orang cakap like imagine satu rumah like seven hundred dollars
satu rumah eh seven hundred dollars
satu bilik seven hundred dollars up to eight hundred fifty dollars
sebab tempat dia kat woodlands
and then after that then you times like let's say the rumah that I want to go for is empat bilik
no dekat singapore ah so seven hundred uh times four
so one month you earn two thousand eight you never even kerja
so like two thousand eight abeh dah tu you convert the money to malaysia
ah tak payah kerja seh
okay so like rumah kan dia ada ninety nine years lease
so kalau freehold that means like you can stay there forever and ever you can go generation
jadi dia macam forever and ever jadi
let's say ada anak cucu cicit
then dah tu sebab dia orang dah ada the rumah
then they can just like rent the rumah then they can just buy another house because it's like
like they have like macam a certain like oh you can only okay if let's say you are a diploma then you can only earn like two five
two five abeh you need to expect to buy a house with the two five
so ya like macam susah seh and you like
apa namanya apa after diploma ah degree
ya after degree abeh setakat macam dapat like a three hundred dollar raise like a starting pay of two eight
why I mean like sedih you know like cause some people like they don't have the money to even pay for a degree
abeh dah tu like you expect like
kita to hustle sama
untuk macam dapat the same
everybody standard like that is the price of the house to the house tapi ni macam
sebab kita punya level is lain
so macam
buat cantik ah resume tu buat cantik cantik swee swee ke
degree is like macam dia punya baru punya in thing tau
ah sabar two five
wow banyak pe

dah kata degree
oh shit mahal seh
tunda lah beli rumah tak akan beli
aduh peningnya kepala
tiga puluh ah tiga puluh
tapi tiga puluh lelaki tak ada masalah seh
oh ya ya ya betul betul betul betul
eh but I think like the trend kan sekarang is like
semua orang boleh jadi independent like girl dengan girl like guy girl is girl guy is guy and like
if I wanna like work towards something like I work hard for it ah and then after that then err kalau macam
nak slack off
so I think the zaman dah berubah change already
now zaman sekarang orang
like perempuan like like girls
the guy's pride the maruah of the guy which is like
I mean like sometimes it's tak boleh avoid
for satu for one person to kerja
macam mana nak cakap macam sole breadwinner ya like it's impossible like
tapi commission pun tak stable seh
satu hari like you can like satu bulan you can only earn like macam tiga ribu abeh the next bulan you earn lima ribu
lagi like COVID I think COVID nineteen was a good example like
then macam wah so difficult that's why like I think susah kalau like you based on like
apa nama dia commission jer
tapi dia buat satu kerja jer pe
so so dia punya pay tetap dua ribu lima ratus atau the pay already
because sekarang dia ambil orang lain punya commission
abeh like
oh no okay so wait her pay dua ribu lima ratus
abeh dah tu kalau sebab sekarang dia ada commission kawan dia so how ever much the commission
of dia punya kawan let's say satu ribu then after that dengan dia punya satu ribu
oh okay okay faham faham
she untung ah
branches cawangan
okay faham faham faham faham
dia tu lah
tak ada hospitalisation leave eh
lagi banyak kerja lah
ah kalau let's say the future
like lagi teruk macam mana
betul betul betul betul rabak ah macam betul betul macam for a moment kan
macam mana okay okay okay
how can the anak tak put aside
dia tak buat financial tu eh
kan mak gitu
tak boleh seh like
like tak ada hati nak

ah eh okay mak nak my mother is doing that you know
I just want it to be like a simple one then after that dia cakap ah tak apa ah kak mak nak buat err kampung tak apa tu mak bayar
as the daughter I feel macam tak sedap apa like how can
how can I macam ask my mother to pay for
kat singapore boleh lah tapi kalau dekat macam indonesia tak perlu seh then you want to do like at indonesia

nak ah
combine ke tak combine
cause like you know like mum thing you like if you want you wouldn't want to friend to like you know like macam to share the habitats defence
sometimes they have like parents like ada dia punya own wish
okay lah tak larang kalau dia nak buat buat lah kalau ada duit tak ada duit nevermind
nasib baik got save save kalau tak save then like teruk sia macam gitu
sabar after like a certain period of time ke apa
ah ya lah macam insurance ah no it's not insurance it's investment
ya so kalau investment dia macam
okay so at the after twenty five years I keluarkan the duit
I keluarkan the duit like after twenty five years ah so

um aku tak gurau ni
mana you need to pandai cari lah you cannot obviously find those yang
apa tu yang what do you call that
you cannot you cannot go to a like a shop itself kalau shop tu ada brand it's definitely going to be expensive you need to buy something yang tak ada brand sebab okay if I tell you um chanel
a bag from chanel or a baju from chanel and a baju from H&M but it's the same exact baju it's the same exact colour however will there be a difference in price
abeh tak nak layan sia aku
wei aku macam nak buatkan rumah untuk coki
and then he like the circle carpet outside if you have saw it and then he also suka bilik mak aku
tahu ah
bilik mak aku a'ah dia dah romantic mood
eh kau ni dah kenapa tengok banyak sangat siao
blackout lah like opaque like eh windows pula astaghfirullahhalazim
ah sebab kau kan vampire
so your house is like just dua tingkat you know you look at my cat
no but then if you open the tingkap near your bilik it wouldn't be a problem right near your room
tapi our air freshener that right there is like an ioniser
tu the white colour thing the ioniser it it basically right it helps you remove all the bad and harmful macam bacterias in the air and then keluarkan the cool air
I cannot understand punya fame you know I realise something weird about me I like like groups that are not famous
he has like wow I know him badan dia like okay it's just something I would like to have you know asal ada benda yang memekak luar kat situ
I'm not saying maisonette is like atas bawah tau rumah dia macam rumah shafiq tu
I mean if you want if you want to have your own house isn't it macam you want your own space
why oh because you just live in your room eh sekarang dah terbiasa gitu lah oh okay okay faham faham
so ah rumah aku ni sebenarnya banyak buku tapi buku-buku ni semua dia untuk perhiasan aku tak baca pun
uh huh atuk aku ada kasih aku buku bila aku P three
cerita dia pasal kampung girl a'ah dia sebenarnya nak kena kahwin dengan siapa lah aku tak tahu
and then it got really complicated aku tak pernah habis baca sebab I find the character so cringey
and it's like macam about love and I'm like awkward reading a love story
but aku rasa kalau aku kasih ulfa she would like it I guess
ah about apa don't get me you know I feel like she has very high standards
macam even the like okay so that day I ask her like
what ah to jaga her atuk and nenek and then she said that her mother is currently working for jems I don't know but I think got out something
like that time ada thing but then in the end she managed to go also pe
ya lah ngok
serious ah asal
ah selalu gitu oh my god girl you want me to get started on christina and ulfa eh no salah nama christina and insha
so what happened is that they are keys team both are them ada boyfriend kan however the thing with insha is that she's for always with her boyfriend like twenty four hours with her boyfriend
so it's so weird sebab macam it goes to the extent that the netball cage key the cage key that the captain have to hold is with her boyfriend
and like macam okay so you're not do you follow them on instagram okay but anyway but if you do then they actually like macam you know how like friends and celebrity couple sometimes they get in a bad condition or situation they always like put up this act or show that's what okay insha did to christina so on like
she she said that macam kalau in terms of apa
and then I was like are you guys best friend I texted christina tapi ya that's not how it is
dan dan hari tu dia orang keluar together they did a double date lepas tu azhari didn't have money like I don't know I don't know why azhari didn't pay for it but then akif paid for it like christina punya boyfriend he paid for insha punya cable car ride

this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit

but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam

ya but it's a more of a countryside punya tempat mm so okay lah there's no distractions I think
actually is a really a good job because like dekat that time intern tempat intern aku bourbon
kau tahu tak admin earn berapa
ya no because I think you see industry mana lah like I feel like kalau kau should search in
maritime punya admin cause they don't go they don't go on board
they just duduk office and just um
friend is admin dekat maritime that time dekat bourbon so she earn two point five but then after after the is ready is one point nine ya correct
under law punya admin
two points seven cause she got a lot of experience no no need you just admin macam registration orang nak masuk
those work that people don't want to do macam filing and stuff

dia macam the oriental express um
what was it eh situ apa ah sebelum the knives out okay jap before that I just wanted to say about the knives out lah okay
it's kinda okay even though err aku tidur lepas tu but I can somehow see that it's a good movie because it actually sedikit banyak macam the oriental express
it's about uh a person being murdered orang kena bunuh and then macam there's a lot but whereas in the oriental express there were twelve people were being suspect and twelve of them were all the murderers that's why the other that's why it was being stabbed twelve times lah kan
but then in this case dalam the oriental err apa the knives out err dia pasal about err dia punya apa this guy umur dia lapan puluh lima tahun eh dia baru sambut dia punya birthday yang lapan puluh lima tahun lepas tu lah dia kena um dia orang assume dia kena bunuh lah
so after that aku tak tahu apa jadi
but you told me that there was satu orang there's a one suspect right ada satu orang kena suspect so ya
this kind of err story apa err story that story line is is good lah I like ah kind of like ya I'm gonna watch it again later
semalam penat babe
um before that what did we watch eh sebelum tu apa kita tengok
you can't have more than one spell ya because aku rasa because one of them err jatuh hati dengan um dia punya apa classmate dia ya
kawan sekolah dia so dia actually dah buat because there's a bully eh actually this guy is a bully so
ya what they did was um dia orang semua spell a cast on him to turn him into good guy and eventually he did lah tapi sayang ya lepas tu yang the one that fall in love with him actually had another err spell cast on him so lepas tu tahu tahu besok dia dah mati
not so super natural sangat juga it still err ya it's true lah
mm tadi apa lagi kita tengok kita tengok oh the nun we watched the nun
aku rasa cerita conjuring is the best horror movie lah
it's it's kind of err thrilling for me memang ah aku pun penakut tapi
lagi pun tengah COVID kan so macam apa lagi cerita kau pergi tengok
for me aku rasa aku punya favourite movie one of it is err mamma mia

I like the one that you showed me yang cerita unhinged tu oh that one you guys have to watch man
banyak emosi you know emosi tertekan leh aduh that's like ya
betul mm
actually aku tak expect ah
and then when and then when it came to a part whereby she started to horn and then you said that okay this is where you will begin okay then I'm like okay I thought he's gonna be like macam stalk her all the way just focusing on her but no she he actually went way beyond and
apa err attacking the family members and all the stuff
wah that's tu seram eh tu kalau kat singapore aku rasa just err
orang tumbuk-menumbuk punya eh
daripada kena road rage
so lepas tu it falls on a saturday and then his wife was supposed to follow him but then the wife actually got invite invitation to err the wife actually is a bake caterer lah
um she was invited to do catering for her event and she's an artist photographer lah begitu so she owns that a big err art gallery eh so lepas tu
err bila dia kata I ah can't follow he she can't follow him to the reunion for this saturday
and then lepas tu uh the guy actually got um connected back with dia punya ex-girlfriend ex-girlfriend back in the college and then the ex-girlfriend also texted him saying that um my husband is not coming then
err I think this guy tak nak ada any connection ah so he just you know
okay I just say this guy A lah eh I forgot the name so this guy A dah pergi dekat reunion dia so he saw his ex-girlfriend
and then it came to a point where the girl the ex-girlfriend actually keep on macam harassing him in a way like kasi uh gambar yang dia tengah pakai sexy lah yang dia tengah apa err ah seducing in a way so two months later
err what what was there sekali dia nampak apa gambar-gambar dia macam nampak gambar familiar kat gallery dia gambar-gambar dia is
all the pictures of him having sex with the ex tapi gambar tak tunjuk
so the picture dia punya face wasn't shown lah so he suspects suspected dia like that maybe this his girlfriend of his is err you know revenging him back tapi tak tahu pasal apa
sampai masanya the woman at the err wife get to know that you know um
so lepas tu dah habis he err the wife somehow got kidnapped
he actually got a try to find for his wife and then he actually stream live dekat dia punya ah social media when he got caught up with dia punya friend bila dia dah kidnap dia punya wife
yang ah this this this district attorney person dia put
sudah dapat tahu and then um
so ya she was she was ni ah she was ah

ya ya nasi ambeng
actually it's sedap lah quite quite err nice lah
dia ada consists of uh ayam lemak apa ayam lemak cili padi begedil paru sayur tomato carrot sambal goreng ya it's quite nice lah
so we have been covering ourselves with blankets selimut selimut ya so
so pergi oh yesterday we went to um
where did we go botanical garden but we didn't get to hike banyak sangat pasal hujan hujan dia macam stop lepas tu hujan stop lepas tu adakalanya lepas tu hujan lebat so macam kita tak dapat nak err
habiskan kita punya hiking lah macam selama ni kita habiskan dalam kita will always habiskan dalam ten kilometre twelve kilometres tapi kita tak dapat buat semalam

it's like macam siala kalau manusia it's like apa
five people tall like that macam gitu ya
and then kita akan dapat news seorang kanak-kanak berumur
dimakan oleh sebuah eh seekor buaya
aku eh aku tak berapa takut sangat lah dengan crocodile semua ah
ah itu lah kalau dia jump kita elak kita elak kita ikut macam P ramlee boleh settle
ramai juga semalam eh yang berumur-berumur jalan-jalan semua
I think pulau ubin not so bad macritchie is like wah kaki aku sakit eh
dia punya jalan dia is so narrow that aku
ya when I went back island wow my leg kasi pain
it's like aku tengah jalan K depan and she was at the back and then there was this noise like you know if monkey were fighting K if you don't know how monkey fight or how it sounds like you go and YouTube it okay so it was a very loud noise and she actually just take her hand and just pull my neck like
a'ah seh it's like boleh gigit engkau sampai cedera parah oh kau tahu tak
monyet business
the older one is like macam
dia macam sign kau ah dia kata jangan bilang dia jangan bilang dia
ah pasal kau dah pekik nama aku
next kalau ada next word coming from your mouth he's going to come at you
takde air because okay that time eh bila aku pergi bali kan then lepas tu they have these tourist place whereby kau boleh beli kau boleh beli banana and it's like the kecil-kecil banana in a bunch
for like two dollars so lepas tu kau boleh feed the banana the banana pulak kau boleh feed
kau boleh feed the monkeys there lah and there were a lot of monkeys there where tapi kat situ ada rangers lah
there's this one monkey aku rasa maybe dia macam hmm primary school monkey
dia tak besar dia tak kecil ah he's not an adult he's not a child so probably maybe it's like err teenager so this monkey actually came to me and then he just snatch this banana from me so lepas tu I think the banana was rotten
so dia buka he peel peel peel peel
I was shocked I was like eh ini biadap eh like I paid because it was so I was so err interested I mean I was so having I was so much having fun
so I kept buying the bananas like up to ten dollars dah so kau imagine ya aku beli two dollar two dollar two dollar so I kept buying and then I buy lepas tu
aku dah kasi kat semua monyet and the monkeys will be like macam dia tak ada datang kat engkau macam simpati punya macam kucing takde eh dia tak nak engkau turun dia jump on you and jump on your head or your body there's like three monkeys four monkeys on me
wanted that banana so I gave it ya gave it gave it gave it then after that satu tonyoh kepala aku okay like after he ate the banana he actually just like
so err aku takut ah aku tak marah lah kalau aku marah dia sekali dia bawa the gang ah mana tahu dia faham bahasa aku so
so bila so that time bila aku tengah jalan-jalan then there's this one ang moh ada this orang putih mat salleh lah dia
I think she was trying to play with the monkey but the rangers suruh kita dah kita masuk kita semua orang masuk dia dah cakap don't try to be funny lah kalau ada
uh grab your banana grab banana lah kalau dia um you know you don't like macam main-main dengan dia lah so aku rasa this orang putih main-main dengan dia so he actually wanted to bite her ears
aku rasa dia angry ah or aggressive ah because dia main-main the rangers tu dah kata jangan main-main so so he actually wanted to bite the ears ah so dah macam just
not really that deep bite lah sort of one bite so the ah the caucasian girl was at shock ah dia pekik and in the ranger was like I think they had this macam
kayu ke apa aku tak tahu ah I don't know what's that lah so he just like macam whack it so that the monkey will go away
aku tak tahu ah that is that is because they are rangers they know their monkeys aiyo
ah tahu tak apa ah nanti dia panggil dia punya gang lagi ah tak payah lah terima kasih sudah
aku rather deal with one monkey than a lot of monkeys
okay maybe ostrich farm is one another one is yang dekat mana eh
I mean they they don't really macam
they don't really macam
um ya malaysia ostrich aku rasa I felt regretful that we didn't get to feed the kangaroo when we were in australia
I have holidays in november and december right so you know I always have this macam
so aku just want to ask like do you prefer to work at home or do you prefer to go to your physical workplace
so ya that's that's that's our life lah eh kita hopefully things get better hopefully things um
okay lah I don't like that you know we take things we take life for granted we thought that you know you could travel as much as we can we could go out as much as we can you know but when this kind of thing happen we will like macam
alamak tak boleh buat tu tak boleh buat ni
we can't get to travel as much we can't um and then when we now we used to have like gathering kita ada gathering we used to like just book chalet and invite you know like what twenty thirty forty people and then birthday celebration
we will invite people over but now is like macam
orang lagi banyak yang hush hush you know coming in to celebrate birthday and all those stuff
aku rasa vendor pun kesian juga lah it's like you know all these err thing macam numbers restricted numbers and all those stuff that is coming from the government right so when pengantin dah buat bayaran for certain for certain pax eh
and then the pengantin okay lah kalau aku pun aku pun rasa macam I just wasted my money you know like few thousand dollars and then now the numbers is like that so and then vendors pun
kesian juga lah like macam aku dia also want to earn a living you see so there was a point whereby there's err apa err miscommunication between the pengantin and vendor like asking for refund and all those stuff like even vendor also didn't know that this thing will happen
and it wasn't even in the contract so some of them that I heard is like blaming the vendor you know of not giving me back tak highlight dengan duit lah you know and those stuff but
aku rasa it's it has it has to be um
communicate both face sekali lah

the rooms actually always separate there's outside door yang you boleh tutup then you can remove the bilik macam besar so that's what I did during combined but I think they are doing something like that actually they just said to just sleepover
no lah then ask us to stay over for dua malam mesti dia ada ya so we so we booked a room on the twenty first twenty second monday tuesday ya the celebration is on sunday so sunday stay over then monday morning we check in
early check in ah I've been there before no no the pools were but dia limited so you need to book when you're there lah so basically ah I want to go to the pool do you have any like

I don't really need I mean sometimes I envy tau orang yang macam they got friends basically hang out with school friends but for me I don't because actually after my O-levels after so I just went my own ways then just like did my ya cause I wasn't really that close to my secondary school friends
even my friends also okay lah last time we were closed always hang out but then now like those around my batch and stuff everyone is like doing their own things so we like so we like one down do our own stuff if we meet up we meet up because of whatever reason on that day my friend's father passed away then macam like jumpa gitu jer lah like you know

I think I eat like what dinner pukul lapan I didn't eat breakfast my breakfast is coffee
then after that aku lupa nak makan
eh jemput minum so my breakfast is just coffee so laki aku cakap you have to look after your health is not that I do not want to look after my health is really tak ada masa ya
dorangnya buku sekolah lah lah buku madrasah lah apa benda nak kena beli
dah sec four hairi ah secondary ah
that's the first choice ya second choice is bukit panjang actually dia punya
dia punya aggregate is ah
in between err normal academic and express he can go to express but if you want to go to an express class he have to go to the the sekolah yang
yang tak best sikit lah
like teck whye secondary which we don't kita tak nak that's the only school that is nearby us that we never choose
laki aku tak suka lah dia punya um
ah ya so the neighbourhood dia tak suka jadi dia cakap cannot other school boleh dapat normal academic pun takpe tapi tak boleh
any school lah any school that we choose tu boleh
pasal sekolah eh tak pasal kau punya kerja eh actually dia dah macam dah branch out dah
eh tapi aku tak faham ah kau punya kerja buat apa
jual besi dah dia punya sales really drop ah
kerja kau ni macam mak mertua aku ah
kau jual besi mak mertua aku ah mak mertua aku jual itu ah ya
right not enough experience lah tu
but your work wise memang dah
kau tak boleh function ah how to function
macam lyn ah sama
asam orh kunyit ah but tapi kunyit hidup ah jangan pakai kunyit powder
kunyit hidup aku baru buat aku aku aku blend ah ah I blend kunyit
and then I put in one one container then I blend ginger put in one container so anytime you want to drink like err ginger lemon ke apa kan mm then you just take lah
letak air panas letak lemon letak honey habis cerita
to me deep station err dia punya tu terlalu
ya because dia letak garlic juga apa right
the lemon grass no dia dia macam blend benda untuk masak kau faham ah tu yang pada aku macam tak tak best
aku ya I always mix with water then I just drink it as a shot
that one is for what buat bangun pagi jadi perut kempis
you see ah that is the old people thinking you know if you watch if you watch the err those yang health punya shows kan the health shows yang melayu punya tau
terus cakap eh this one is all
it doesn't matter minum air sejuk ke tidak it does not affect your system
so macam aku aku kan ada yang that package that time err urut kat tempat err tempat cina punya
urut ah then dia urut-urut aku dia cakap oh you shouldn't be drinking too much err cold water your inside ah sorry china kan china women so dia cakap your inside is very wet aku dah ketawa of course lah my inside very wet kan darah kalau dry I die already your inside is very wet
aku tak faham apa maksud dia very wet
but then dia nak cakap aku punya tu sejuk ke apa system aku sejuk ke aku pun tak tahu I think it ya lah I think is a problem ah because aku kadang-kadang macam minum air sejuk banyak sangat kan kaki aku sakit seh
well haus nyah
aku tengah menyusu haus tau
serious lah kalau dah artiste mesti lah better
ya you add in that one lah like those floral floral things you know like the chrysanthemum ke bunga rose ke the dried rose ah they say is good for complexion
ah can ah it's easy it's easy to get what anywhere just add in aje tak payah letak gula it's just to flavour your your air
semua masuk gasak ah
tu ah kan cakap mak-mak ni berbual ada jer daripada satu topic branch out
kalau betul dapat is fifty dollars fifty
okay lah buat
macam laki aku buat ah that time aku tak tahu eh so one of the years birthday aku dia kasi aku ni

aku tak tahu pasal that time kita baru masing-masing masih kerja like still very new kind
experiment kena kasi darah
ah tapi dia kasi darah I think a lot ah then have to come like couple of times ah so
sumpah aku tak tahu nyah so he say because of that then they pay me to be the experiment punya person so the money I get I buy this one lah wah sweet lah sangat touched touched lah banyak-banyak
lama anak aku masih kecil lagi dua-dua aku masih belum ada hasif masih tak ada
eh dia takut jarum ah aku tu yang aku hairan
for all my pregnancies the man have to come to to take their blood or whatever right dia takut gila jarum kecil macam gitu pun dia takut huh the err they check blood right
mother and father punya blood or something ya ya ya hmm
even like at work if he has to do the um flu jabs right he always decline then I say why it's err it's compulsory he's like no it's it's not it's not compulsory so that's why I always reject uh huh anyway dia cakap anyway dia berbual dengan dia punya nurse um the nurse told me not all flu jabs are
what's that word no no no not murah it's free what they they already have to take it not all flu jabs are effective
because the certain flu jabs are for certain types of flu string so sometimes you can you can take the flu jab already and then the next few months you have flu which but it is cause by different string ah dia tak effective jadi dia cakap if not effective what for I take don't need to take ah
siao because to me to me pada aku you should take it because you are facing all these people all the prisoners all the visitors coming in and out test ya took twice
actually nowadays dulu aku aku dulu macam aku gung-ho ah tak takut tapi lepas tu ah
sensitive makin takut
kalah bising ah
sekarang dia dah start jalan kan jadi rumah aku berselerak ah
ye lah
I don't mind berselerak sometimes but
diri kau sendiri lah
I know lah it's good but you see ah I'm I'm dealing with different cases already macam kau aku rasa ian is very well behaved
I have all the phases that's the problem that's why I aku macam stressed because I have one boy I have one eh actually ah this conversation do we need to speak singlish or not
no need eh nevermind ah
asalkan ada dua-dua lah mixed
hairi dia susah nak dengar cakap aku kadang-kadang and he is very defensive and he is going into the teen phase okay I have aira who is in primary school but because she's a girl and she is going through
hopefully soon belum seh she ask she ask me you know ibu when am I going to get my period five already primary six
dey kau sec one eh sec two ke sec one I know you're the last one you know when but if you follow genes lah aku primary three
dia dia dia aku punya marker dia kalau dah start dah start kan chocolate lah ah that day she start craving for chocolate stuff or sweet stuff want to go mcdonald's then he will ask me are you going to get your period already so ya I think so dia aku punya marker every month
nanti kadang-kadang dia mood swing aku tak mood swing aku okay jer lepas tu nanti dia macam nanti dia mengamuk mengamuk mengamuk lepas tu dia dah mengamuk nanti dia cakap dengan aku are you going to get your period ah tapi after that I'll get it lah he's my marker first then after that I will get it nanti dia okay kelakar kan ya but but after that will be ah ye sejiwa lah sangat ya I think we sync already
ya so I have aira then I have hasif who is coming into primary school level and he talks so much and because he has the influences from dia punya brother and sister jadi dia punya perbualan tak macam budak primary school punya perbualan macam elly masih boleh berbual cute cute
cute lah masih cute lah juga hasif tak tau dia berbual macam orang besar dia dah macam more naggy now maybe because I'm naggy or his brother is naggy lepas tu dia and then he he like
abang why you never wait for me abang can you quickly do this kalau kalau aku ada macam abang you never clear the litter bukan aku yang suruh tau dia yang suruh
in a way lah tapi nanti abang dia complain nanti macam kadang-kadang laki aku cakap tanya aku whether I'm okay or not aku I have to tell him the truth ah I'm not okay
there's once I actually complain to him kalau aku punya kerja eh senang tau kau bangun pagi kau cium anak happy semua anak-anak tengah happy apa tanya okay okay I see you later ah then after that bila kau balik you attend your stuff already outside you go to the gym you come home it's dinner time the kids happy then it's already bedtime so you so so your time with them is like just it's only like one two hours ah it's bed time already finish then it's my time with you ah but in the middle
you you don't need to settle their breakfast you don't have to settle their lunch you don't have to settle their dinner ah then you don't see ya me instructing them eh pergi mandi lah sekarang dari pukul berapa kena solat kena ni kena gitu ni semua tolong ibu oh my god
alah camera tu camera tu for show jer bukannya pakai pun bila aku tinggalkan budak-budak sorang-sorang kat rumah
then aku penat tau aku cakap dengan dia kau balik kau nampak semua dah settle tau
except for sometimes berselerak which I will I will always like okay okay clean up clean up
pasal aku tak nak dia stressed ah kononnya macam dah dah tempat kerja is so difficult already then you come home and then you see more mess and you get fed up you know
anything ah so like because I have cats right jadi I have no choice in the morning first thing in the morning I have to do is vacuum then after that I mop
by the time tak payah tak payah tunggu satu tak sampai tunggu tiga jam lah satu dua jam jer kau nampak bulu semua bergerak
I have to do it jadi aku vacuum again
but I can't because I have a I have a err a crawling toddler you know abeh aku tak suka jadi aku kena if I shave them ah
tak lah cepat lah nanti grow balik ah ah
kena shave again aku shave sendiri lah mana ada kena bayar apa benda
shave sembarang
ah initially kita shave sembarang a'ah petak-petak lah gasak ah then after that macam initially macam kita nak eh let's let's try to to maintain dorang punya fur so we use the the the head whatever lah then in the end ah tak kuasa lah go down to zero shave aje semua terus nampak macam ah nampak macam biasa balik
aku punya ni banyak message ah macam banyak sangat itu ah messages coming to my phone
help apa
condition rumah aku
takde there's no way lah I the only way is for me to lazy parenting lah the robot I have I have it no it works the thing is aku
we were observing the robot tau kita cakap kesian robot ni pasal dia banyak benda yang dia kena manoeuvre macam kalau aku jadi robot kan aku macam like alamak meja alamak ada child punya benda alamak mainan no and and that's how dia macam macam confused ah so the best the best thing ah when I was using it the best was when it is in the kitchen cause it is easy I do not know where to park it ya it's a huge one
kita beli second hand aku punya benda takde lah first hand semua second hand
I called it lazy parenting lah I just order them about macam ayra sekarang dia dah pandai
belakang a'ah lah
kelabu asap ya granite
actually rumah aku dah dah takde is not in sync already all the stuff
it's all dah no ah the island I push there already because I don't I don't bake any more mah ya ya pasal aku dah tak bake jadi aku letak jer lah tolak ke tepi dulu so I have space to move around in the kitchen
then how yang tu kau tak pergi yang block two one eight tu why jauh daripada apa
I think so ya because sometimes err aku punya neighbour ni dia sekolah dekat kranji juga kadang-kadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik three zero seven dia ambil lagi satu bus and then it drop behind aku tak tahu
rumah jannah
aku nampak rumah orang jer view apa
cause macam those rumah-rumah yang baru kan the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing aku macam like ya exactly pasal tu pasal we say resale the best that's why resale punya prices is still
pasal that time aku tanya ah naz rumah aku punya two years two years ya
ya means kalau dah naik market if I want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
jauh ah aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus tau cause of a southview kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak block sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang block sana block mak mertua aku block sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya block macam block aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada dengan yes correct then yang kat hujung-hujung is ada tapi mahal
ya this location quite difficult that time ada yang block opposite opposite my house block two zero four dia jual dia punya
then dia jual murah because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then I was thinking maybe I should just go for it lah since I'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later gila nasib baik ya I was thinking of that ah
ya I was thinking you know like eh this is the best time you know yang let's just do it lah nanti kita boleh fikir cause right now also I'm still paying for for the house using my what
not not not tapping into his so okay apa
dia bayar dia punya part is lapan ratus aku punya part lima ratus
hmm but kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena increase but then again you'll be difficult lah cause if I prolong like this no job no contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser bila aku nak itu
chey sudah lah
kejap jer then lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak
tak aku aku nak need bigger space but then aku pun fikir bigger space means we probably buy more things
just be happy jer lah dengan apa dengan space yang aku ada because most of the time pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik
three is just enough in in in apa in the end pun kita plan at this moment ah because I don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
aira yang tu yang tak she volunteered she say nevermind hafis sleep with me
hmm because dia sorang jer apa yang she gets everything what her own her own like double girls lah ah but because I was thinking also because their age gap is very very far hmm that's why she don't mind that hafis sleep with her
they are all sleeping together still tilam tilam kau tu very useful bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal
so she sleep on her own tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam
ya in a way lah so gasak korang lor
tu dah start nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne
jap eh aku punya sini tak tak tak tak tak mute ke
kita berbual habis tu aku tak mute aku punya itu
ah takde pun
la ilaha illallah tak tahu lah
apa-apa ah
satu setengah ah mm mm
ya exactly cuma masalahnya is the noise from the background aje hopefully it doesn't affect so much lah exactly habis-tu pula telefon aku aku tak tahu
but that's the thing you see our aku tengah pasal bila first time aku nampak this thing kan aku macam like
tadi kita tadi kita dah macam cakap kan pasal ni aku cakap aku nak berbual dengan laki aku tapi laki aku cakap ya I don't speak malay which is true lah he no oh my god tak aku jer mixed mixed aku sorang jer yang boleh berbual dengan korang melayu fasih no problem takde masalah langsung kalau nak kasi aku apa kalau kau nak aku berbual apa tu chey berbual melayu yang yang no lah I mean like using proper malay words also I think I can try
a'ah tu lah aku pun rasa macam gitu eh cakap pasal banyak english banyak melayu kelmarin aku kena interview that was on wednesday no on tuesday
so mendaki nak interview aku so mendaki cakap dengan aku eh hasif ni kan in every of his class pasal hasif kan ambil yang mendaki nya classes which is free right ah in every of his class dia actually very outspoken pandai berbual ah you hantar dia untuk itu eh untuk preschool tak cakap ya dia pernah start daripada preschool lah start daripada play group dia cakap eh how about your other children aku cakap oh ya my eldest tu memang ah daripada nursery ah all the way sampai kindergarten oh kita tengah cari families lah yang hantar anak-anak gi ah preschool kita nak interview you boleh tak
okay jer aku aku sembarang gasak lah tak lah dia nak kasi aku voucher tak kesah lah aku tak kesah if it if it helps the community apa salahnya then dia cakap ya so kebetulan kau ingat tak yang there's one day yang aku hantar korang satu article a lot of malay families tak hantar so it's on conjunction with that kiranya dorang nak interview aku tu kan
to create awareness that how macam mana ah sekolah ah for preschool kan for preschoolers it's good to send kids err to preschool to
you know permulaan from all the different cases lah
ya ramai a lot so bila aku berbual dengan so yang datang tu is a mendaki person and then there's this person I do not know I think she is err from
yang err
maybe from the preschool punya aku tak tahu lah okay lagi satu rupanya dia berita harian yang interview aku tu it's from berita harian so aku tanya actually kenapa you nak interview I pasal the preschoolers ah cause is it because of this article that I read err budak-budak ah apa bangsa melayu tak itu
aku cakap ah ah tak dorang tak hantar then I say kenapa err what's the reason you tahu tak apa dia punya reason dia cakap dorang cakap is not necessary
jadi dorang hantar K one K two jer huh
aku cakap lah eh itu zaman mak bapa kita seh zaman mak bapa kita ye lah kita hantar K one K two jer ah tapi sekarang I think
the system dah berubah
if you send to the government punya the punya dorang memang tak ada childcare service apa it's only a few hours everyday lain lah kalau dorang ambil ambil yang macam ah macam aku punya is private so they have a childcare service from seven to seven
so pada aku macam like apa seh pada aku like why would you say it is not necessary pada that's that's where the interview ya that's why we need to interview jadi kita nak tahu apa pandangan you bila you ah decided to hantar lah anak you pergi preschool
that's where then then I ask lah this interview going to be in malay or english eh abeh dia cakap in malay lah aku cakap my malay is also tak strong sangat mm kita mixed mixed boleh cakap ah boleh ah so kita berbual
the dia punya question was very legit ah like macam okay first kenapa aku hantar anak aku pergi preschool secondly ah bagaimana ah bagaimana ah
mm ah apabila menghantar mereka tu kan ah did it help
did it help in what dorang punya perkembangan ah dalam pelajaran
ah development self development tu aku cakap lah pasal dorang punya motor skills dorang punya cognitive behaviour dorang punya social skill and then benda-benda yang yang preschool boleh ajar mungkin saya tak boleh ajar like saya ni bekerja jadi macam mana nak ajar dorang math ke
more sight words ke phonics ke it's very difficult for me to read I don't have the takde macam dia punya layout on how to teach them
tapi kalau hantar kat sekolah kan semua dah ada
err a program for them ah senang sikit
so dorang tanya like um
then dia cakap like macam how do you feel lah bila hantar like is there any improvement aku cakap ya ada banyak lah improvement terutama kali anak saya yang nombor tiga tu dia memang very err friendly
you know he's very active dia pandai pandai berbual public speaking pun dia tak takut
which is true tak takut seh ah dia macam like ah gasak ah sembarang ah you know
so but aku macam like feel very abeh dia tanya aku lah like err is it do you think that it's because of finances
then aku cakap terus terang ni memang berat because saya ni sekarang tak bekerja jadi ah finances okay lah berat juga untuk anak-anak tapi this is for anak-anak education there has to be a way mesti ada jalan lain kalau nak cakap pasal private tak boleh
we go to a government based ah government aided sekolah and then kalau kita low income mesti the sekolah has a system for the lower income family jadi dapat further subsidies that's number one but if you want talk about kalau tak nak berbual pasal finances there could another reason the other reason kenapa ah mak bapa tak hantar anak-anak pergi preschool kerana tak ada tempat ah tak ada tempat mm in the neighbourhood tak cukup preschool ya so so I cakap okay terus terang ah untuk hafif I masuk kan nak masuk kan dia infant care
I registered him for infant care bila I masih dalam perut this is where orang semua cakap eh kiasu nya dulu pun I pun macam gitu aku cakap gitu dulu pun aku macam gitu apasal eh orang apa pregnant masih dalam perut dah dah registered now after that I dah kena I tahu kenapa kerana tak ada tempat so people have to be like
think ahead cause a lot of families right now I told her lah a lot of families right now dorang prefer hantar anak from what I know I notice prefer hantar anak pergi preschool pergi childcare daripada ada maid kat rumah because kalau kat childcare budak-budak belajar can develop you know at home ah
susah kan
take care only tapi ah
nak tolong ajar ke nak tolong exactly
don't try so hard lah cukup lah
terus aku macam like lepas tu aku fikir-fikir balik aku macam like eh kesiannya kalau kita punya malay community really do not want to
ah tak lah aku dengar apa ni
laki negro ni dia cakap
cam first dates semua tak mahu bawa apa ni macam makan semua just bawa jalan-jalan lepak tu macam wow betul lah pasal kalau
macam dia press for more nanti macam nampak lah what kind of person she is but ni semua orang dorang dorangnya alpha punya fikiran lah
aku keluar dengan kau ingat aku keluar dengan mimi kan tak pernah bayar apa-apa
tu ah cakap perempuan kalau gini dia boleh makan for free seven days straight boleh jumpa
but one thing aku agree dengan dia kan
macam baru kau kenal kan
she belongs to the street unless korang official about the status
macam kau tahu orang cakap macam kalau kau pergi date
kau fuck around pe gini macam suka hati dia ah
so like you have no right to like cakap dia slut ke apa kalau boleh meet sesiapa kau nak kasi dia banyak choice siapa dia nak as long there's no official status
dia berbual pasal ni kan
oh betul
ah ada yang kau pernah dengar this guy nama stephen top
tak stephen something ah some black guy dia tak believe in macam relationships yang macam boyfriend girlfriend
no matter what as long kau belum married kan you are considered just dating
I rather you still dating terus aku fikir balik
it somehow makes sense but maybe culture pun plays a part ah
asal ah
kau nampak ah
kau pun tak ada status pe
takde eh
yang laki selalu kau post eh
untuk aku ni semua macam pun ikut surroundings ah
cam not everytime kau kena guard
musim-musim you know you have to time yourself
kalau it's time to emotion let it out lah but if it's not the time then it's okay for you to be this way we understand
but at the time kau kau tak cakap then you still takde as long ah you know
cause of them takut cakap
laki takut nak keluarkan emotion kan but
some of them dorang okay keluar emotion but they don't know when
bila orang tak tahu macam mana nak express dorang punya emotions aku tak boleh pegang ah
ha ha ha asal asal dia cakap gitu
missus cheong sedih ah tak nak tengok
to think of it kan it's as seram at the same time
once dia dah realise ah
tapi untuk aku singapore is just that kita tak jumpa orang yang extreme ah like feminist
kau sendiri macam it's a wreck
dia is the true
epitome yang yang YouTube
video yang kau cakap most of this
just macam rosak ah like
that's why kau cakap they use this macam as their own is their moral compass ah
like tak tahu apa yang salah betul dorang pakai ni then they just follow from there
that time cousin aku kena
dia post about ada accident dekat sengkang kan
he happened to help orang yang apa this anak dengan bapa dia ah accident motor abeh dia cakap pasal err dorang accident motor pasal dorang apa ada a wild dog
terus end up this
perempuan datang like into the conversation and say that eh like cakap like
there's this humans is the problem for entering dorang punya wild life and dorang cakap if this is what if you're talking about like putting them putting them down
terus cousin aku macam flip ah cakap you don't put words inside my mouth
macam don't stir something up that it is not there
what the fuck sia attention rabak sia
I mean like dia nya cousin aku nya intention is just to show that okay this area is quite dangerous imagine kalau kau lalu kan just beware of the dogs ah the macam apa wild animals
ni semua orang just find it a like opening of for them to just preach
tak tahu ah malaysia ah
yang malaysian
yang belikan anak dia semua eh
anak dia yang gemuk tu kan
what if the this whole thing is turn table laki yang buat gitu then laki cakap kak sedar lah diri muka kau tu dah buruk gini gini then you know it's just turn out to be ugly
ya we are untuk aku kan at the end of the day we are just living in two separate rules
dia tak macam sense of emergency ah
cannot focus macam takleh
ah dia kacau ah
dorang just macam
camne nak cakap eh pasal the reason why tiga orang to operate that one man machine kan is cause that two person tak tahu apa
ah macam terus ni apesal
rabak sia tu
like kepala ah orang
umur berapa sia
kalau aku aku tak kesah sia like I think taufik pernah cakap ah the macam untuk aku the apa not it's too accessible apa knowledge eh
dorang pakai sembarang jer
oh macam dia annoyed
kau kau pause eh
tak kan
takpe ah aku bawa gi toilet jer boleh berbual-bual sikit
ah tak ah sangkut kat luar
a'ah cuci tangan
semalam shuk shuk bawa apa ah makan
wah best pe macam yang taiwan taiwan nya eh
wah aku dah macam
huh bastard asal
oh tak halal
huh kau makan
oh kau taruk tepi untuk simpan
sial ah kau
asal ah
dia apa fight as if like politically or
untuk aku is a marketing strategy ah
kalau dia macam berbual macam admit dia president siapa nak vote dia seh
macam dia have to say
tapi kau tahu yang dia popular face habis cakap grab them by the pussy kan
ah itu bukan dia cakap during press ke atau during ni kan it's during macam dia punya free time want to record dengar kan
pasal tak salah aku aku tengok video clip is like somewhere macam kau tahu yang camera macam sembunyi-sembunyi abeh dia ada wall abeh ada
macam mesti lah orang orang kat luar laki lain pun cakap macam gitu apa it's just that ni pasal dia korang macam nak use that against pasal ramai orang kalau kau tengok they use that phrase against dia apa this is how he treats women gini macam sial ah
pasal orangnya perception eh perspective sekarang is like
camne eh they rather have someone yang in the closet
macam sial rather than orang outspoken
dorang takleh accept orang outspoken macam orang he only talking his own opinion in what appears on his mind what tapi orang tak boleh accept
pasal kalau untuk aku orang tu clean kan terlalu baik aku aku always despise
macam there's there's always a way macam macam mana kita berbual pun kan ]even though
you want the best for each other kan but definitely kita macam gini boys talk atau mesti ada berbual kotor pe like gini gini but
orang yang macam terlalu clean kan aku always very despise macam
bukan aku jealous tau like how are you really sure kau macam gini punya bersih like
cam they feel their feelings express it that's all
lagi twenty seven minutes
all the lie tak ah
asal eh
tak tahu apa dia nak ah
so at the end of the day pun different orang tengok lain pe
so macam upon macam texts pun sama
macam kalau aku cakap sial lah kau
tapi kalau kau baca eh dia ni maki aku pe sial
tapi kalau aku aku cakap in a very playful way
kalau kau tengok macam kau punya thoughts macam gitu then kau fikir cara gitu then
how can can you blame me sia aku say in a very cannot blame me ah
non-stop sia tu
ah dorang ada record macam some dorangnya
talk ah sedih sia
pasal kau boleh dengar dari suara dia sia kau yang ah
aku tak tumbuk kau sia I mean like kau tumbuk aku
kau tak cakap abeh amber macam aku pukul kau jer pe
pots and pans kau campak vase
like tak salah ke tu salah seh kau tahu
macam aku ada listen to few tips orang kahwin ah orang dah kahwin cakap
then that's why it makes sense bila dia cakap
kan selalu cakap stephen kan
buat apa kau nak relationship lama-lama
in the end asal kau nak a meet up marriage before you get married you know you are creating another problem for yourself
kadang-kadang fikir balik macam sedih sia kalau yet to find out
macam apa ni the person that kau sukakan and then bila korang kahwin is just a different person
abeh korang stuck tau you are stuck there don't know like kalau aku tinggal
ni thing aku salah bila aku let it be it's gonna be a problem for me so how do I even solve this sia
like I really dia just stuck sia
that's why aku always believe this phrase macam doesn't mean we can vibe we are compatible
like tak semestinya kita boleh vibe macam eh but we are compatible for each other it doesn't mean that vibe and compatibility is two different thing
like aku boleh kita like boleh macam
ah people always said like wah if I can vibe with you okay okay but sial lah that is just a touch atau it's a two different things seh
whether you're not kau boleh tinggal serumah dengan dia and like accept who she is that's a different thing sia
so untuk aku macam orang selalu macam cakap aku boleh vibe dengan kau it's a
it's not macam it's not cause you can't true
dia nya expectations or
that's why aku takut aku tak understand about aku nya self especially
like sometimes aku suka orang ni then aku akan go for her
but kan bila dah at the stage macam boleh aku just cabut diri
untuk aku is like tak one thing is commitment ah macam the commitment of having someone to jaga is untuk aku really takut untuk aku
ya aku nya reason why aku aku understand this part of me eh aku cakap reason why aku takde mata air bukan aku cakap aku takleh dapat aku boleh but it's just that
dah a few times aku try and then aku just cabut
like aku just fuck up like I always find the reason to fuck this up ah like
just ghost her atau
ya so like sometimes aku just macam bingit ah macam takde then you know like I want something but bila dah ada nanti aku just cabut
so I always remind myself macam
kalau aku suka orang aku cakap kalau dia betul-betul then go for it ah if not then for what you waste your time
like in the end of the day kau akan cabut juga pe at the end of the day kalau kau tak suka dia
that's why that time kawan kau tanya aku aku terus teringat sia ni
kawan kau yang yang kerja nurse eh part-time
tak ah dia tanya takde mata air macam tak ah macam asal entah eh terus aku terus cam teringat ah ni like
aku kalau ada ada ah tapi it's just that at the end of the day aku cabut
aku ya
ya pasal
untuk aku pun itu is a different way of err camne nak cakap eh
it's a different way of macam kita own body ada own mechanics ah
the reason why macam aku dengan kau is always macam
diam dulu then nanti baru gerek is cause technically we are trying to protect ourselves
like dia ni boleh ngam ke tak tak leh ngam then why not why for what aku waste akunya time
kalau dia punya dia punya mindset is macam I got nothing to lose the world is mine
then like just live life to the fullest lah that kind of mindset ah but for us yes we have that mindset but it's just that macam
macam apa ni you don't need it unless we really need it come ya
romanticism atau all the stuff
ya lah I understand
one thing dorang been berbual pasal gender role ni semua kan dorang sendiri confused with their own gender role this kind of thing untuk aku lelaki shouldn't be the one doing it the most of the time it's it's a feminist trait lah I would say
so macam all these macam sweet stuff
all the macam masculine stuff the girl of course have to be kalau dua-dua side macam family then how how do we even counter this
there's no balance ah then after that's when nanti dorang dah complain oh dia ni annoying ah gini gini gini
like you eat too much sweets sakit tekak pe
kalau kau suka laki tu apa-apa dia buat pun sweet pe
dia tak buat apa-apa pun sweet abeh kalau laki tu macam he's not your type
asal pula aku kena panggil creep
ya lah
that's untuk aku there's no such thing ah
cause the scariest part kan macam macam mana kau dah kahwin dengan this someone kan
how sure are you that this twenty four hour otak dia is bedek bedek
bila kita tengah main kan aku boleh imagine someone else asal kau tak boleh imagine someone else confirm kau boleh imagine someone else pe but at the end of the day you have to give and take let her be and let her think let us think
that that's why the misconcept of macam
like oh takde connect then they cakap to make it in a very layman dengan very
to see that they are smart atau they can feel all these oh takde connection ah
ah lagi
thirty seconds nak tidur nak tidur
bro you can't even masuk malaysia
buka the border
but when did it even tutup the borders is it recent no eh
but I also scared to masuk malaysia now though like now malaysia tiba-tiba banyak gila case
ya bro like in a day dorang ada macam three hundred cases tau
but it's like macam at area but still like like it's COVID man it's like the virus dia boleh spread cepat-cepat pe no matter where you are
I know like a a week ago or two weeks ago it was like oh uh one case dekat like uh what macam punya yang macam apa sunway lagoon I don't know then tiba-tiba two case seh tiba-tiba like twenty lah blah blah then tiba-tiba in a day like one hundred or two hundred I don't know something like that
basically like spike up like the cases spike up in a day banyak gila
for real so I'm kinda okay that kita tak boleh masuk but the thing is for the past few months it was close like macam asal kita tak boleh masuk tapi ni dia dah spike up balik so I don't know
dorang dah start balik apa dorang punya I don't know like dorang dah start they have to start like staying at home again
I mean I was I was stalking like malaysian punya celebrity then dorang macam yay lagi then I'm like oh really for real that was like four days ago two days ago ada orang post gambar I don't know
I know crazy right bro I literally just only thought like it was a getting better then like tiba-tiba spike up balik
first like okay like alhamdulilah ah like I finger crossed it won't happen to singapore like even though yang korea dapat apa the second wave tapi it's not as much as malaysia tau
ya but it like the cases are not like super macam uh as macam extra like macam banyak gila
ya mana ada time nak
nak stalk syafiq kyle
even though I tak suka pun I akan tengok seh super bored
no I just know that eh I only watch if I know the pelakon or if I like dia berlakon
did you even know there's like dramas like halted dia punya then I was ah before this I also like quarantine different time kat saudi kan so I was also keeping up to this malay drama dia I think episode thirteen pasal because of COVID dorang tak boleh film so nearly the drama is been like three months or four months it's like stuck at episode thirteen I think so I don't know how they gonna continue back or what
oh my god but aku pun before this I don't even like to watch K drama like I just I watch malay drama lah K drama malas gila so damn long
no but it's so annoying is like ah no but I only watch it if it's like if I like the main actor together macam
iya lah ya lah I know but like I just I cannot no but that one I watch one I watch so far the one that I watch so far is okay to not be okay that one I like and then the other one uh was when this dude ada breast cancer or something uh ya breast cancer ah
ya cerita lama
um apa like what cerita
that's why I cakap I tak suka tengok K drama cause it's so draggy
six times I swear every time she macam ah I don't know what to watch goblin then I'm like bro are you in this month in this like in this year because of COVID it because kita tak boleh keluar right and cannot do anything right I literally watch the watch goblin three or four times I'm not kidding
ya wait especially if it's like if it's like a korean drama like or like anime ke or a cartoon macam disney you know those kind of thing oh my god like macam fictional punya movies you know people write like fan fiction over them
for real for real I like macam one hour so attached to freaking marvel punya ah like you know because of like I was so attached to that because like whenever ah bila apa uh uh ironman died right so I was like damn I need closure I seriously need to like closure so I read a fan fiction on like how like after tony died like dia punya macam fake anak macam you know work to spiderman lah other than that like than I was like wah
that makes me macam happy already
I don't know but like as as for me if I'm like so into something right especially like macam marvel like after ni before I masuk uh I watch end game aku tengok like the whole movie sequence before that
then aku baca just to make myself feel like happier
why boring it literally gives me so much like pleasure and like macam warmth and comfort knowing that macam whatever at least spiderman ada girlfriend even though it's fake and it's not like real but like you know whatever
like I mean like even K dramas I saw like macam they did like alternate these stories of like that story
I mean the purpose tak semestinya untuk for that but macam mostly people macam when you like something so much like you crave for more what macam if you kau pernah tengok spiderman kan
you know how spiderman uh uh spiderman before this is like spiderman when gwen right macam peter parker and gwen right like ya but the one with tom holland sekarang ni is like peter parker and but tak banyak movie of peter parker and what so people make fan fiction of it then kita macam oh my god imagine ah so happy
ya it's okay tapi aku baca fan fiction just like just to make myself happy lah you know satisfy myself even though it's like not true not real but like it's okay
like what korean dramas kau tengok
how about is it that intrigued macam like
tak pernah like tak classy
like everytime hor I want I compare like malay dramas and korean dramas I mean since I am malay so obviously I would compare what like really like I don't know maybe it like speaks for the way like koreans dress in general they so aesthetic so macam
no but general in general like if you want to buat like if you want to macam buat the drama tau like K drama they very they like go out from like they very they like they they there's no boundaries like you know how like hotel kau pernah tengok hotel del luna right
like bro imagine that but in a malay drama I don't think so I don't think you can do that because you know why because in malay dramas there's like limits and boundaries that you cannot pasal religion that's why
ya cameo then he datang right
oh my god I remember aku tak think of that sia
at the end okay lah it's okay but kalau K dramas usually kalau cameo dia datang just to for fun like just there to like for that one episode one episode jer
and also I've never heard of like macam korean drama buat second season
for real abeh maybe sebab dia macam hospital hospital
of course [lah]
now like it's way even at like this malay station ah some tiga atau sembilan they they showing hotel del luna now you know
oh my god oh my god park seo joon dekat suria
bukan eh I don't know
like dub macam orang lain cakap take over orang melayu is talking like they speaking in melayu
no but dulu-dulu when my nenek watch cerita like macam apa uh you know the channel one
so it's a korean singapore punya channel but dia cuma apa tunjuk like korean show like they dub you in malay so weird
tak suka seh it's so it's so
like so uncomfortable I don't know I don't like watching dub one even anime macam english hmm weird
but ya eww weird nya
like audio original I mean I mean that's why they like like over the time like I don't understand when like people especially in the western areas who cannot watch movies that are not in english like you what if you cannot watch any uh subtitle uh the subtitle at the same time like hello it's not that hard macam buat jer lah like
like do you know like this there's this one time this I don't know this what this person daripada this uh are actor ke apa entah dia macam oh ya no no not even actor I think they were in general like kau tahu parasite menang uh a few awards kan dekat america
so like uh I think even the the actors there or like you know a few known people there and the people yang selalu macam dorang tak happy tau sebab a korean movie won like an a prestigious award
ya and then people pun macam but why though pastu dorang macam cakap lah like like it's not in english like how you watch a movie if it's not in english how you understand and then like bro you guys are dumb or what like you can really watch and read the subtitles at the same time but I mean because you guys are so used to only your own like only english which is so sad like
even I tengok even I I tengok malay drama I pakai english subtitle tau
like even though I understand what droang cakap I still put english subtitles because I'm so used to seeing like subtitle and the video itself
aku tak aku tak kan masuk tau aku kena dia aku kena tengok cakap apa
right I can I watched I I I scared I can see both you know I don't know how to explain is not I see both it's just like I can like if I hold my phone I just like tengok I can see both like I don't know how to explain but like I see both
tak ada ah sebab kadang-kadang okay because ada korean drama for me ah ada korean drama kan I don't know about you ah but from what I see right korean drama kan dorang ada banyak kalau you use the subtitle ah translation kan dorang banyak guna bombastic word tau
ya big word so I was like sometimes I take a few I take a few quite a long time to process tau apa yang dia tengah cakap ni tau
that's why I was like that's why that's why it took me quite awhile that's why I because that's because of that I have to like macam read it slowly ya so that's why macam kadang-kadang termiss apa dia cakap ya so I was like thinking are they actually memang
ya bombastic words atau dorang actually because of the translation then dorang guna big words
but I was like thinking macam if you watch malay drama english drama like I don't think they use very big big words
huh really macam apa seh
singapore punya oh my god malay drama tak boleh sia
paling tak aku tengok anak anak metropolitan that was long ago but I never even keep up I just
I didn't really understand the story I just know that they are like really like macam kids who like have problems that's all
anak metropolitan singapore
after that after that macam dia punya tu what
ya I don't understand seh how to use semua tak tahu
then tak boleh
huh you didn't even masuk like this year or like last year
ya I went like masuk oh my god last year I masuk banyak kali seh pakai pakai train
it was so fast no at first I was so sketchy tau aku macam oh my god mesti like lama mesti like boring and like tired tiring it wasn't even that long cepat gila five minutes jer
for real really the immigration was so fast but I don't know but I went during like macam the june holiday
five minutes I'm not kidding five minutes for my mum I I went many times right so the first time I macam I didn't count but apa but the orang cakap macam five minutes so the next time I came my aunt really taruk timer it was like four minutes and like uh fifty seconds four three ya she really put timer you know
tak tahu it was last year
but kalau woodlands shouldn't like it be like the water wasn't around the water area I don't know but I in the train but you know there's a train from singapore to right
ya it's so fast gila like that time aku pergi um dia ingat puasa lagi pergi situ pastu uh tidur kat sana tau okay pastu the next time I pergi I pergi pastu burger dekat uh pastu balik rumah balik like I didn't sleep at I only went back home because it was that fast
it doesn't even feel like five minutes it's like I was just sitting there nanti macam dah okay
cepat gila kan
even when I took the plane uh they say when I balik right from to singapore it wasn't even thirty minutes you know
but usually how long is it from from singapore to because aku tak pernah you I how many times have you been to I feel like I'm the only person yang tak pernah pergi
but it's not like macam okay ah this this this december holidays let's go like you and whenever you go to kau pergi sebab ada family business but then you macam okay we can also chill at the same time is that what you mean
seremban kat mana
I never been there dude the only time I go malaysia is eh I only go to pun macam satu dua kali
from there from um you from but you went there you drove or you naik train
huh what apa kau I don't get it you say thailand now you say england
the atas atas sekali
oh my god that's why I heard this person from singapore dengan kawan dia like naik the motor pergi mana entah like wait
the driver okay will like damn I mean it's easy if you naik motor ah but then it's so cool to do that oh my god
I mean but but it doesn't I think people usually who go backpacking they they are going it for like the view mostly that's why they don't mind macam hotel like cheap ke apa ke at least as long as they get the view
pastu gi walk you walk from one country to another
I don't know some people do that you know okay some people do that but I swear people who do that gila I cannot seh
like that like that that uh I don't know for you know dekat malaysia this um this orang dia jalan daripada to like ipoh or something just to just so that they can see their punya anak cause of COVID
ya I heard something like that like the father literally walked from one state to another just to just so that they can see the anak
just the just the thought of it macam you think tak [leh]
okay lah I mean kau nak jalan buat apa ye you can take the bus you know you're not in the dire situation to walk
mak I
have you no but you know eh uh few recent juga I exercise my mum I go walk from here to jurong east is not as bad as me walking in the reservoir you know I swear walking in the reservoir is way worse I walk from here to jurong east to like JEM to go eat it's not even that bad
I'm not kidding it's really not that bad it's really not that bad bro I literally walk from here to jurong lake garden I really walked with my cousin I walked the whole time daripada this belakang ni I walk sampai jurong lake garden I swear I'm not kidding I that was really a few days after I balik you know
from the bus stop pastu pergi masuk situ eh
go jurong lake garden but then my cousin satu macam let's go then I'm like okay I guess
like aku aku ah aku ingat kita orang akan stop dekat you know the you know there's like a macam park or something behind science garden eh science garden pula science centre
no apparently where where was like aku jalan jauh-jauh that was only five kilometres
ya like half what almost to bila I nak masuk jurong lake garden that was only five kilometres
I was walking I was walking from behind here you know the old block yang dah tak ada
that that's how I follow the route follow the route uh with um ikut pergi science centre
sorry lah baru balik kan I don't know my directions yet pergi JEM pun susah
dude for real oh my god I felt so stupid my mak kan you know how you can tembus from JEM to no no from JEM you can tembus to west gate west gate can go to ng teng fong to
my dumb ass literally my mum suruh I pergi nak cari barang tau but then aku confident dah pergi kat JEM dah beli barang kan pastu you know how there is also another there's also another shortcut from JEM to be big box
I don't know why my stupid my stupid brain went to the shortcut tapi how you know it's close cause the big box also close so I went to I went I saw the sign and it was the the shortcut was closed tau and then I'm like
oh alamak tak boleh jalan shortcut ni then my stupid dumb self literally walk like I really keluar I had to like cross I keluar daripada JEM really cross the road go to
do you understand kau faham tak I was thinking of how that shortcut was going to lead me to even though it's actually big box
I know I I took ah you know actually they close the shortcut then my mum macam huh really dorang tak pernah close pun pastu I was like ya ya ya they close pastu then petang we went again and then we went to westgate then I'm like wait and then my mum is like eh buka apa then I'm like gosh I hate myself
I was so confident I pergi aku jalan and then dia cakap tutup then aku jalan lagi then I'm like okay so it's really close that means I have to like walk like so far away to like from JEM to
I never I never look up you know I just masuk and like
I just need to know my ways see I'm just like not used to going out and that's why actually alone pula tu I'm still getting used to the idea I have to go out alone you know
I've never in my entire life I mean ya I mean okay cause it was saudi so I've never because of saudi I tak boleh keluar like no matter how how old or how young you are like if you are a girl usually cannot leave the house alone
they will get asked by the dajjal
protected it's haram right haram
orang yang not that yang
oh so the the ones yang ada faith and yang ada iman yang kuat they will be they will get protected
oh the real like muslim like one yang betul betul like hold faith
you will be strong enough you akan react out which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself what
no matter how I I think no matter how macam you you even if you pernah experience pun I feel like if it's at that time truly you can never imagine like how you will react unless you for real for real like you can believe in yourself lah like your faith
ya so macam cool seh and australia kan
is it hiroshima yang ada nuclear
is it when you masuk that macam fake rumah then it
like macam what's like apa yang macam
no but I feel like I feel like if uh aku like hopefully not if aku like if ever if there was ever a time where there was an earthquake aku rasa aku akan panic to the point I will not hide under table I will just and then like suddenly everything fall on my head then like
I feel like no matter how much I prepare for something like maybe if it's not enough like I even if I prepare for it like aku aku tak akan when I panic aku tak kan think straight at all
as long as dia boleh protect your head should be fine lah
I mean dia if you you akan obviously kena squish kena squash by the building but as long as you tak kena uh ni apa fracture your head ke apa ke should be okay that's like the most important part what
ya I feel like macam when like when like uh whenever I see macam yang apa earthquake punya macam what's that word macam dia punya aftermath like you know how they find the people in the building semua
the ones alive their their their okay but maybe their kaki yang stuck kat dia punya macam I don't know like a hard apa benda entah
I mean obviously lah earthquake semua ni it's all in god's hand like it can happen anytime whenever it wants to
this COVID jer I don't expect all this to happen but I guess it's way it is I mean like a couple years back pun ada the spanish flu which was also like
macam a few decades ago I guess
ya but still macam like the way it's like I mean I mean it's a history macam memang tings like this happen like even if it's not common
but it was a big thing in saudi seh in like middle east for real ya I was so surprised aku tak tahu yang SARS is a big thing in middle east
and but I don't think when it happen kat singapore it was like that like wasn't academic also
dorang ada vaccination wasn't there a vaccination for SARS
but it's a like a it's like a like a macam what is it called like a respiratory
but isn't it a respiratory punya virus
like I even when I saw when I heard about SARS about like when I was in school I I didn't know like it was that serious I thought it was just orang sakit tiba-tiba
I didn't know it was actually that serious then now that I'm living through a pandemic which aku still tak boleh brain
we have to do an assignment and it was like oh what what do you what what can you write a macam essay about like how like a diary like a letter to your future self macam like what if feels like to be living in a pandemic or going to a pandemic then I'm like dude I can never imagine like twenty twenty like dear future self I am living through a pandemic like that is so gila like I cannot do you understand like how we're still alive it's so weird tak boleh seh

that's why my dad suruh I pindah balik kat singapore cause he takut yang kalau dia tiba-tiba kena buang then like I'm in the middle of school then macam tak baik tak tak nice right for me to suddenly like ditch

eh wait but the thing kan but the thing is kenapa dia nak tanya kita pasal intern bila kita dah habis intern and kita intern sama timing pe and now we schooling again
kenapa eh
is it is it supervisor dia orang lelaki or something like that
plymouth ah K that I heard jadi he can actually do it lah but the thing is the main topic sekarang is kenapa dia selalu awak ah
kenapa bukan saya saya yang single awak yang dah attached pe dia cuma message
tak tapi saya expect
okay saya tak expect apa-apa tapi kenapa dia message awak lebih daripada saya ah I think because awak lebih friendly ke awak lebih friendly looking saya garang sikit
awak kena faham eh badan awak petite biasanya siapa yang petite orang lain akan tengok as macam lebih sopan lebih lembut
percayalah saya saya tahu kita sama height tapi
saya lagi besar awak lagi sempurna okay K let's not talk about this okay tak proper kita boleh tukar topik dia K jadi nak saya bilang apa jadi pada saya dah
K kalau awak notice kan kehidupan saya tetap tenang sahaja
tak banyak complication kerana saya tak berbual sangat dengan orang lain jadi saya tidak ada banyak masalah lagi-lagi
okay ya lah tak kelakar okay jadi lepas tu I
nak message ah cakap thank you terima kasih like I usually do that for every outing like even if kita
I go out with you kan I always say macam thanks for today ke apa semua then
nak message dia nak message dia then suddenly dia nowhere to be seen tak boleh nampak profile picture dia cannot even see his contact profile or whatever
then I ingatkan oh maybe whatsapp glitch ah whatsapp glitch jadi
err tak ah kita dah nampak muka each other kita dah nampak then the thing is
my profile picture were tak catfish ah dia punya profile pic pun sama then the thing is he look so cute why why are the cute guys like this
oh dah okay ya basically every single social media platform and then tak nampak dia lagi and
that time lah eh saya just tahu dia tak suka saya tapi that's okay pasal
dah biasa kan online biasanya dia orang cakap apa ghosts ah ghosts I got ghost stick in my life
tapi tak apa lah ni kehidupan kan manusia what to do it is what it is jadi awak ada calon apa-apa lain tak untuk saya
calon apa ya
ah tapi dia bising lah
tapi tak semestinya dia lagi tua daripada saya dia apa secucuk how do how do you say that in english ah
jauhkan aku dari adik-adik ya that's true
ah okay wait how do you even know him same madrasah or school or
okay faham juga but let me tell you something K my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
bantah no no no no bantah is you shake right
kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain in a
in a macam manja-manja way of course lah mana boleh gitu kita dah ada boyfriend of course kita kena setia kan jadi macam I prefer kalau dia macam
berbual dengan saya eh you are my girlfriend seh eh janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita happy sama-sama
oh my god wait tak
ah apa ah are you serious
ya tapi mind boggling because yang that time somehow ya saya kena roped into the story kan jadi I was also confused lah apa tengah jadi ni then err girlfriend nama dia pun ada mention my name
and the thing is kan all this time dia baik dengan saya tau dia tak pernah tak senyum pada saya dia selalu macam senyum nanti dia hug kalau nampak saya
muka muka dua ular kepala dua err agaknya ah
dengan pelik seh story gitu yang oh lagi satu saya nak bilang ah
bukan bukan nama saya jer yang dalam story itu kawan-kawan lelaki kawan-kawan lelaki tu yang perempuan dia pun letak nama dia orang sana
lelaki itu bukan gay lelaki tu straight cuma lelaki tu
ada juga kawan perempuan takkan tak ada kawan perempuan kan ya jadi yang ex girlfriend ingatkan dia tipu perempuan tu dengan saya tapi
apa mm mungkin dia tak begitu confident dengan dia sendiri ataupun dia punya relationship dengan lelaki tu jadi
saya tak tahu lah saya tak nak cakap apa-apa saya tak nak buka aib dia nanti saya yang kena eh kena jadi saya pun tak cakap apa-apa pasal tu ah saya just diamkan mm
err saya rasa saya tak sepatutnya tanya eh bilang awak tak apa lah nama dia orang semua tapi ni jer lah yang saya boleh bilang awak
yang lelaki tu kawan saya saya saya dah memang tak suka lelaki tu ah
saya cuma ah nampak lelaki tu sebagai kawan baik saya macam abang-abang
tak tak tak dia hanya kawan sahaja dia nampak saya sebagai adik saya nampak dia sebagai abang itu lah kita
punya perhubungan ah kalau faham lah jadi ramai orang pun tahu kita tak suka
a'ah satu sama lain macam kita yes correct we are just platonic friends but a lot of people know that
jadi my supervisor ni melayu you my mentor pula cina lah then kan ni sebelum COVID jadi kita kena buat kerja sama-sama kan jadi saya yang kena pass
uh all these work to let's say kalau dia cakap kena pass err find me to another person kan err jadi I just do that lah tapi nanti
the person I pass it to semua they tell me that it's wrong I'm not supposed to do that then I have to go back you get that feeling
oh okay but the thing is yang the company itself should also update their tablets or their or their desktop or whatever because the thing is we are bound to use it whether at work or what
naik turun bukit you know what let's let's grab this topic completely I want to forget about intern
but most of them still think that we are macam or they have a choice to not choose because I feel like
saya pun confused ah tengok bual-bual pasal apa ni okay tapi tapi saya faham lah saya faham awak kena ah
um okay K saya faham juga melayu kita memang hancur apa yang awak dapat grade untuk secondary ke primary school leh
saya saya dapat B three juga agaknya tapi ah
I do well bilang saya untuk retake kertas tu tapi saya tak bagi pasal uh saya memang tahu saya tak akan ada time untuk belajar untuk bahasa lain atau topic lain
tapi tapi akhirnya tetap fail
awak awak ingat tak yang that time kita tengah
nak cepat-cepat habiskan project sir farhan
then kita tak pergi class kita pergi library
then ah ya ya that one and then uh mister farhan ke miss judy yang pergi library caught all of us dekat sana
ya dia yang tangkap kita semua ah
ya I was there ah saya dekat sana then they nampak saya okay
the thing is kan yang that hari itu tangan sedang berdarah uh
tangan saya berdarah dengan saya tak nak um
lipat saya eh saya tak nak buka sleeves saya jadi ah ku tak nanti baju saya kotor kan kena darah semua
ya jadi saya lipat lah saya punya sleeves then ingat saya cuba potong tangan saya kerana saya sedih ya betul
dia dia ah lepas dia dah marah semua orang dalam library dia panggil saya untuk berbual dengan saya dia dia tanya saya saya okay ke tak lepas tu dengan saya tak tahu kenapa dia
dengan dia punya ketabahan tabah mean apa ya
oh eh okay saya tak tahu perkataan dalam melayu tetapi dia dengan confidencenya dia tanya saya awak sedih kerana awak punya agama tak kasih saya suka perempuan eh tak kasih awak suka perempuan eh
apa lah perempuan ni lepas tu saya cakap tak tak saya saya memang saya saya suka lelaki saya suka saya saya suka perempuan tapi ah ada ada limit dia lah yes
ah lepas tu dia memang paksa paksa bilang ah jer bilang ah jer saya tahu yang awak suka perempuan jadi takpe takpe bilang ah jer saya pun huh

love is important ah for me like obviously love love memang
kau tak nak for
semua benda kau benci like it's all it's all based on hate

ah tuhan dia tak buka dunia ni
like ibarat abeh buat apa kita percaya dalam syurga neraka kalau kau hari-hari
kalau kau hari-hari semua benda yang kau nak kau dapat kau tak yah work for it
kau tak yah stress about it
kau just cam apa kau nak kau dapat ah so like
it's always been that way sampai kau mati ah tak kan tak kan kau nak hidup
tak kan kau nak hidup gitu like
you like what's apa orang cakap what's the point of ah living
bukan like
ah kalau
kalau kau hidup aku nak obviously like
every everything I mean like if a life has a purpose what and kalau if semua benda yang kau nak then what's the point of living right like uh might but basically you were just saying like
we living in heaven ah dalam syurga sia kira kita rasa syurga ah terus dah tak payah hidup pape like kau pun percaya tuhan pe kan
it's been hard lah it's hard it's been hard to tolerate life ah as it is ah obviously ah I mean like uh saying it for everyone ya tapi rabak opinion kau kau cakap

uh dalam wanita like because let's be honest ah like
in life you weren't like kau tak kan kau tak kan dapat perempuan yang sempurna like tak ada orang sempurna pe dalam hidup ni
so kau tak kan dapat orang yang sempurna so like just think deep like kau rasa apa yang those some qualities that
think deeper ah just like what's like let's say lah macam
cam aku okay let berbual pasal aku eh
untuk aku kalau aku perempuan yang aku nak is
someone yang err tak pandang aku macam

korang apa dah mata air officially ke tak
okay ah continue aku punya eh

when she said that aku just didn't know how to take it because tu first time aku pe as I said ah macam tu first time aku pe first in everything tau
aku just
aku just tried to apa ni
aku tak layan sesiapa kau tahu macam dorang ajak lepak semua aku nangis and then like obvious ah like nangis semua biasa
ah aku cam emotional emotional gila and then like
orang ajak aku lepak semua then dorang macam tak
or I didn't apa ni
uh didn't go ah macam I
I wasn't feeling it ah so cam aku just stay at home for you could say for someone uh like me
it was a long period of time where aku just stay rumah
and then aku cam
you know like aku stay rumah for like I think
two weeks ah aku rasa dua minggu ah aku stay rumah case bila orang ajak lepak
case bila orang ajak lepak aku cam tak aku tak nak aku tak kasi dorang reason betul lah aku just diam kan diri aku just
buat hal sendiri ah hal sendiri tak kacau orang
and then ya aku just nangis and I just couldn't accept it ah and ah dah gitu takpe aku when uh even though she said she don't want know anything already and like cry and I'm like I was
aku cam aku cam in denial
I don't know ah for someone else to judge for you to judge or what ah like aku cakap dengan dia cam like
ah asal tiba gini cam takleh berbual ke like
tak kan tiba-tiba nak cakap
ah heartless like tak kan dia tak boleh ingat apa like uh apa kita dah lalui ah like everything
and cam
aku dah cuba ah semua benda sia aku cuba in that in the first one but
slowly I realised cam aku tak boleh buat pape ah and at one point ah I think I was just pestering her too much that I wasn't even pestering ah because actually tu
err hari jadi dia
and then dah gitu aku wish ah
bila aku wish terus ah dia cakap her reply was very
and then uh aku diam ah then aku cam dah gitu takpe then macam then dah gitu aku realised aku check ah then aku check WhatsApp and then just realised dia block aku
on WhatsApp dia block aku on Instagram
err every platform yang kita boleh berbual dia block ah basically
and then aku cam but
the last straw and then so aku cam
aku ambil jer ah aku just angkat jer ah apa yang telan jer ah aku just telan apa yang
dia dah tu kira
the last straw so aku tengok that was the
so I just thought like okay ah I guess aku kena I have to let go ah and
it's over the healing process lama sia
like gentle sia healing process lama sia tu first nya but
you know most of the time it's not going to be ah most of the time kau boleh cakap ah kebanyakkan tak ada orang akan last sampai
kahwin ke jannah from the first one tau
so itu apa aku cakap
siapa tak nak kan semua orang nak lah banyak benda sia semua orang nak like cuma
as I said ah macam tadi like
kalau benda semua semua benda kau dapat dalam dunia pun buat apa hidup pe
tak kan apa beza dia kalau kau tanya yang tiga wishes
cam satu benda jer
apa link sia
pape free uh makanan ah
tapi aku tak nak siapa tak nak free makan aku suka makan siapa pun suka makan
kalau boleh hari-hari Pizza Hut pun Pizza Hut sia hari-hari
muak ah tapi cam
okay but ya anyways walaupun kau berbual tak ada link
takpe aku continue story aku pasal aku nak berbual aku nya story
aku feel bad I feel bad for feeling this way
pasal aku dah dengan
aku feel bad a little bad
aku rasa cam it's a crime
pasal for feeling this because
I already have a girl right now okay kau faham kan
aku cam this girl was like
the ah let's say aku rasa cam second minggu of my school week
so basically this girl was the second my second date ah so cam I saw her
uh at this eating place kat sekolah
kat sekolah ah uh terus dah gitu uh
ini pun tapi ya aku dah nampak dia actually funny story is uh
apa yang kelakar is macam
actually aku
kawan aku lagi dua kau kenal juga ah ah actually tak penting ah cam siapa but like aku lagi dua kita dah macam
uh kita dah macam tiga-tiga dah nampak like ni perempuan
and then kita semua cam nak ah tiga-tiga nak cam don't mind try ah kita just main-main time tu time tu kita main-main tak kesah pasal pape ah
because ah aku pun macam rasa aku heartless afterwards
a bit lah maybe exaggeration but I don't think maybe a bit lah and then so aku cam main-main ah tak kesah siapa nak next siapa nak
try try jer ah main-main ah pape jadi jadi ah
and then so cam
kita tiga ah dah gitu kita tiga buat bet siapa kalah pergi minta Instagram
perempuan ni ah and then ah one of them lost ah so cam dia kena pergi minta
err dah gitu kita dah minta
tiga-tiga ah err in the end tiga-tiga dapat pe Instagram dah gitu err
dorang tak jadi ah dorang tak jadi try
ke apa dorang just
dorang pun ada sendiri sendiri nya somehow dorang pun
so aku cam ya I found this girl
to be oh first aku cam
for a few days aku tahan aku tengok story orang dia semua macam mana
aku tak plan pun actually nak
ah through dia nya social media jer ah as in aku tak tahu ah camne because aku belum berbual
so cam aku tengok jer ah dia nya social media dia macam mana
dia okay
so aku cam oh dia okay jer actually
because like aku found dia punya stories to be entertaining
kau tahu cam Instagram stories dia
uh cam entertaining
abeh cam kelakar kelakar it's really kelakar even for me you know
dah gitu uh
you know uh I was aku tried to aku go ahead ah and then uh aku tried to her ah and then
oh but I thought I was a little heartless maybe exaggerate ah cam
aku dia and then err
to to say ah love at first sight cam
pun exaggeration ah cam lebih ah tapi cam I like her a lot ah
at one point kan I could say bukan cakap not bad ah aku boleh cakap sempurna sia
dia cam dia cam uh ya ni ni ah ni ah this is the one ah this one I thought like oh
so kita continue so we talk we talk we talk berbual berbual berbual
sometimes we misunderstood each other it's okay because uh benda ni semua normal pe
ah so dah gitu takpe ah then
on that day tak salah aku sejuk
nak mampus ah aku cakap dengan kau sejuk nak mampus tak tahu asal it wasn't dia nak hujan dia sebelum hujan and then
aku pun demam so menambah ah sejuk
bertambah sejuk aku cam apa ni time tu tiba-tiba kita berbual ah on that day it was normal tau semua benda normal
kita berbual cam biasa uh
and then tiba-tiba dia cakap err dia ada benda nak bilang aku
then aku cam huh apa dia aku cam tak fikir buruk ah pasal apa yang nak jadi
so terus dia cakap
yang dia dah tak terus aku tanya ah
what's wrong apa jadi apa asal abeh apa yang dia nak bilang aku ah and then aku cakap ah like
ah terus dia bilang ah ah she said that
sama ah sama macam yang first nya macam just tiba
abeh aku macam uh ah what do you mean ah
and then ah dia cakap ah macam
somehow dia nya feelings dah lost ah
abeh macam dia dah lose feelings ah terus
aku cam huh asal seh boleh tiba gitu I thought everything was going good
imperfect ways I saw perfectness ah to me lah I aku nak honest ah like ni I know it's like very
the last relationship I pestered her and then like maybe it's kind of like macam guilt trip sikit ah but
ini I just learnt like okay lah I cannot do anything about it what
itu apa yang penting ah untuk aku like ah apa ni kebahagiaan dia
so kalau dia bahagia aku okay ah
aku cam cakap dengan dia then aku just cakap dengan dia okay ah if that's what you want then I love you enough ah untuk aku I love you I love her enough to let her go ah untuk lepas kan dia
so then aku cam
okay ah apa ni
the day uh apa eh
so aku just cakap ah I just give her a long note I said err all the best in life ah kalau dia perlu kan pape I will still be here you know I'll still be a friend if you want to consider me that you know ah whatever it is know I've always care for you
aku just cam
so aku just accepted how it was and how it is
and aku just wanted her to be happy
talk time and time ah again we don't talk everyday so untuk kau okay tak to be aku tanya kau dulu untuk kau okay tak kalau
kau kawan dengan ex kau
untuk kau okay kalau kau kawan dengan ex kau
okay aku faham ah but
okay so kita jadi kawan ah
and then like time and time I ask about her because I still care about her you know I always care you know to me untuk aku in my own
yang ni apa aku nak cakap ah so like
aku cam okay ah takpe as in I I mean lah I was already accepting it ah as it is I just want her to be happy ah kan ada
happy dah cukup
ah apa ni
uh it's just that sometimes we do see each other you know in school because it's the same school what so cam
oh terus aku I I found this girl ah this other girl at

uh for me ah in the future future kan I uh I rasa macam my age lah like my my age right now um is fifty so that means in ten years time I'll be like sixty so sixty it is like more to finding a very uh peaceful kind of um life uh I I just want to enjoy the nature uh macam suka pergi tepi laut lah tepi laut then uh kita tengok apa pokok-pokok uh then um and having uh just a a few number of friends you know
ah you know talk about your you got kids talk about your uh your life about you punya health uh like that lah
ah betul betul betul macam kita nak apa beribadah gitu ah banyak kepada mungkin ukhrawi lah
tapi sebab tu lah nak kena ada macam apa tu orang kata uh barang-barang yang ada kena-mengena dengan sains lah okay okay okay okay okay
dia tengok time lah
martial arts ke action movie because that is really cray you know to me
uh it really like macam excite you uh you really makes you awake tau macam tak mengantuk you know at least at least eh when you watch eh your mind is not really working
uh their apa ni their actions dorang punya lawan-lawan ah martial arts jadi macam
best lah kalau dapat tengok cerita-cerita macam gitu
tapi tu tak selalu sangat lah that one's only like once in a while only but then sometimes you you
you you want to also watch uh like macam family punya kind of
ah kita nak ke mana-mana kita nak pergi apa tu katakan lah pasar ke kita nak berjalan ke mana ke bila kita ada fit body
of of course lah you have the looks you know tapi kalau your body doesn't fit
it's like when you make yourself fit then your body your look also will be like uh macam orang kata tu cerah lah ah macam glowing kan ah glowing so I mean it is
you know or maybe makeup makeup makeup dresses but they forgot about to take care of their health they forgot about uh what to eat and what not to eat you see ah jadi dorang banyak macam ah apa tu tengok lah banyak pergi mana tu uh makan fast food kan ah you see they they they forgot they forgot about the healthy foods
uh they always think yang the important is to to have a good looks you know buat expensive makeup you know and then wear ah good good clothes you know so that they will look good
younger generation need to be educate mesti kena dorang kena kena tahu lah kena banyak membaca
and then ah dorang kena tahu lah you know uh
macam mana nak apa tu ah mencegah penyakit daripada awal bukan macam like when they have already got the sickness they got disease then they will do something then they will try to exercise then they will try to
uh do the prevention then they will try to start to to eat healthy food I think no lah I think from from ya I mean daripada awal dah kena start lah macam choose makan-makanan yang terbaik itu semua
it is not really easy to say lah okay it's not easy to say because we do not know ah what are the experiences that ah you know people uh I mean orang orang orang experience
ah pengalaman orang kan cause everybody has their own experiences ada background yang berbeza
so jadi um this mental health ni
uh I mean okay lah memang makanan tu penting okay that is the most important okay the what you you eat
you know like macam they selit lots of vegetables and fruits you know and don't take too much of sugar ah that is already dah important lah you know because even then
ah secara holistic yes and then
okay but then some people say some people say that uh but I I take vegetables I take also uh I don't drink too much of like canned drinks and all that but I still got mental issue you know ah depression ke apa so I I so I rasa that um
I rasa it is how you manage lah the situation
ah how lah you manage and you did also like macam talk to people uh with with your family you don't keep to yourself
see if you have any problems let's say you youngsters eh macam like when youngsters eh kita tak boleh simpan diri sendiri lah kita kena bercakap dengan orang ah bercakap dengan family tentang masalah kita abeh pilih kawan-kawan yang very menjayai you know
ah jadi sesama lah you tak payah tak ada macam asyik nak fikir tentang masalah you kan
so kadang-kadang orang ni dia boleh accept uh the first degree of stress
yang ada ah second third degree pun masih boleh terima
ah ya depends on dorang punya capacity so I I I think like everyone they must know their limits
and and parents pun tak boleh push ah cannot push them because if they know that their kid they must know they must know and understand whether their kid because if their kid are not the kind yang
mm nak ke mana eh mungkin zaman kanak-kanak lah
mm ye lah kanak-kanak sebab zaman kanak-kanak macam tak ada stress gitu
ah zaman kanak-kanak zaman yang kita tak fikirkan apa-apa ah tak payah nak fikir kita tahu kita makan tidur main dah ah you see I mean
mm uh macam best lah kadang bila kenangkan uh waktu kecil-kecil dulu uh when my late dad was around ah how I spent my time with my dad and then uh apa tu
mm bila kita sama-sama ah apa tu spend time balik kampung you know a lot of things and as a children you don't really think so much lah about like
ah then you woke again then you you like play again you know ah you don't think so much about paying bills you don't think so much about other people punya problems like you have your own problem and you carry out your own problems you know you don't really think about other people punya problems ya macam those memories are I think are the best lah
uh there are some also children they are traumatised by their childhood memories you know that is not good for for for them lah but as for me my own experience um if I have a timer like what you say you know uh where where where do I want to go I nak pergi tu lah the my childhood life lah mm
so jadi um what you say you want to go to the the ages lah okay okay
I think peringkat umur lah eh I think uh that that that is the reason ah why like macam you you are still young you know
orang kata tu pengetahuan nak nak uh kembangkan lagi pengetahuan
uh kan nak expand kan lagi your knowledge so jadi
you rasa sebab you perlu pergi to that ages you know to nak lebih mendalami lagi uh benda-benda yang you tak pasti benda-benda yang you tak tahu mm
apa lagi eh yang kedua ketiga apa eh okay lah yang pertama dulu lah kedua ketiga macam tak tahu lagi nak fikir apa apa lagi nak cakap
oh okay maybe um wang lah ah I think oh I nak jadi seorang millionaire ah bukan sahaja healthy tapi my wish
kalau I ada duit seperti jutawan jadi seorang jutawan ke apa ah I mean not for myself but I think ah I like to help others ya help others and then I like to give I like to give to charity ah I'm a very like macam
then bila kita ada duit tu kita ada ilmu yang banyak ah kita boleh sedekah kita boleh berikan kepada dorang so I think tu yang yang can give me the most satisfaction lah itu second wish lah second wish ya first first first first wish is healthy then second wish uh seorang jutawan ah kaya raya
ah takpe lah you dulu lah what's your first wish and your second and third wish if you have
since I have uh children so of course I I don't really ask ah more like of course lah as a a parent you want to see your children ah succeed in their life you want to see your children like macam
have and will be a successful because the of course that is uh memang tak terkecuali memang you nak tengok anak you berjaya
they are arrogant you know they arrogant towards other people macam sombong gitu macam apa tu
uh tak nak dengar kata orang lain you know macam terlalu ego ke so I
err tidak ada perkara yang uh kekal dekat dunia ni so jadi uh whatever that you have whatever that cherish it lah cherish it and also share share among other people
people will like macam apa tu ah respect you lah respect you
you know ah in this life right manusia manusia ni dorang ah memang akan tengok pandang tinggi lah kepada dorang yang berduit ni semua kan
tapi kalau you berduit tapi you tak ada akhlak pun boleh pandang rendah juga
ah you see so the best thing is uh whatever it is ya buat yang baik lah kalau you ada duit pun tapi you sombong kan
ah so tak ada gunanya lah orang pun people don't look up for you people don't look into you and people don't treat you as a someone that can show a good example to generations you know and people will forget you I mean if people want to remember you yes but people remember you as a person who has who is arrogant ah you know you have a
kalau ada superpower eh kalau ada superpower I nak habiskan kerja rumah dalam satu minit
oh macam flash ah speed lah
ah macam tu macam speed gitu macam whatever that I want uh I do eh I want to do in a very fast manner
then I I I clean up the house right like macam wah habis one minute gone or two minutes wah all the house clean already semua dah bersih wah see I I I
uh I mean like then you can have apa orang kata tu relax lama-lama
ah rehat lama-lama ah but unfortunately I do not have that such power
um tapi kalau ada
you know like mac also you also using your phone don't need to you know like last time you use uh apa
ah you know senang semua but okay dulu kalau nak masak kita nak kena fikir buku pastu flip flip flip the pages ah sekarang tak payah sekarang ah sekarang ah you tengok jer youtube
ah you google jer okay nak cari resipi apa masak apa ah then you know from then on can you can already uh find the recipe that you want
main problem like contohnya I think for adults eh adults should be okay because they already know how to use the phone they know ah they know when to use it you know uh they they know like macam when not to use it you know they they they have the orang kata tu tahu bila nak focus tapi kalau children memang talking budak-budak ni you see when they are already get used to phones at an early age eh
you have TikTok and dorang dah lah macam malas sekejap macam sekejap-sekejap nak tengok TikTok sekejap-sekejap nak nak nak apa nak buat TikTok kan
ah kerja rumah semua terbengkalai then homework pun terbengkalai kan and then uh last time eh you see uh budak-budak dulu they want to watch the television they they if they want to on the television their parents will scold them eh cannot watch television ah you haven't finish your homework now they watch youtube also you do not know because the phone is with them ah you see so
ah you yourself you think how you because you yourself ask you to sleep you don't want to sleep you see you are you you you suka tengok youtube you suka tengok netflix ah lagi sekarang netflix selalu dekat phone ah you see susah kan kadang-kadang
nak nak nak stop ataupun kita nak ketepikan mm handphone tu
um pun ada good and bad dia lah maybe maybe I understand that people they are using this is to maybe cut cost
of uh you know human skills and all that but then when you think about it kan kalau were to take over humans kan then what humans going to do you know certain things boleh lah kan certain things I think um can you know take over humans tapi certain like macam profession tak boleh take over humans ah you know I think certain certain professions lah not all professions you know macam doctor you that's why boleh jadi doctor ah macam mana jadi doctor
I rasa patient tengok pun takut takut dengan dengan dengan ah you see ataupun nurses take over nurses I I don't think so lah that's why I tell you macam certain professions uh memang tak kena lah kalau I mean take over
still need uh you know human ya you still need human touch you know human skills you know and then can you imagine kalau take over abeh kita ni nak kerja apa ah you know how to earn money like that
see so kalau macam humans kan lain humans kan ah humans ada limitation ah dia macam sponge kan humans dia boleh adjust
ah you see so ye lah and and to add to that and to add to your ini kan questions you tengok macam ah apa maid pembantu rumah
ah you see you are not going to to let the to become the maid of the house right ah you know like in terms of like cleaning up maybe lah can but then in terms of you talking about eh taking after the old people don't know uh how to how to really like macam like you say lah human touch they lack of that
use use the app for for macam good purpose lah I think for cleaning up no problem because like like macam you talking about cleaning up there's not much of like macam uh I mean skills yes you must have the skills but not so much of like macam
uh thoughts to put into it you know when you do cleaning up um like macam uh you do the job cleaners and all that uh simple simple job can take over lah
uh you know but other jobs that require uh you know you need deep thoughts ataupun kemahiran ah macam kemahiran yang orang kata tu yang yang besar kan macam doctor dia punya kemahiran dia betul-betul besar kan so takkan you nak suruh take over kan mm you see
tengok lah tengok kepada keperluan pada keadaan pada keperluan pada keadaan memang when you talk about technology in years to come ah macam-macam kan technology akan datang so jadi uh we'll see lah that
mana yang lebih perlu lah at which at which sector
rather than you know like sekarang sahaja orang dah macam-macam ada banyak masalah mental problem sekarang I think kalau ada kita nak adakan lagi um orang kata untu menggantikan uh all the professions uh orang akan ada banyak lagi masalah mental health problem
mm and and and one thing and one thing pun I think um if you nak have this right untuk menggantikan the soldiers pun not bad so that you you don't use so many soldiers let's say you go to war ah kan tak ada ramai lah human beings yang mati mm

ah ya so stupid so dia nya screen dia macam
ya like fuzzy but still tiba-tiba the car on the right swerve into our lane then become our fault they say oh this is what happens when you driving under err influence of alcohol you cannot predict err accident
ya ya that's why suddenly you know the car swerve into our into our lane then I got I got a macam flashback of my accident that time yang time chinese new year
orh the parents asyik suruh kita balik like oh ah kita masakkan ni kita masakkan tu then kau balik lah makan kalau kau tak nak balik then kita tak buat kan you know that kind of thing
then you will rasa like feel bad what

simon suka apa
my mum's today because every week week then we balik sana right so sometimes dia makan sana then I balik I tak makan
like balik bishan then I tak makan then macam I feel bad lah cause
ya then simon also kadang don't eat at my parent's but most of the time he will come home and eat at my place then he will balik and then he will eat again so that's why he become fat already
ada exam soon is it
four modules ya four modules is quite heavy though considering you ada full time job and
he he tak he's not studying right he's just working kan
oh so he expects macam the same the same thing lah
oh gitu but lain what

because I tak nak clashed dengan simon punya if I wanted like a shift job I dah police lah like what I wanted to do right
tapi ya like so far tak get back
ya no he's is err office hour paling lambat pun maybe around seven or kadang-kadang he on course night training then he will come home late lah but it's never

ya and then plus apa
like shift job tak kesah apa like ke tak ke like you still need to go and work what
oh yes yes yes yes dia ada it's like morning but it's split into two right I remember you
I very macam um quite err
pressured lah cause like kadang-kadang the kakak will ask me
ah kau tak nak cari kerja ke as in not not directly macam kau tak nak cari kerja but more like um kau nak buat apa sekarang like oh uh kau kau sekarang nak masuk sekolah like you know this kind of thing then I I've I rasa macam a bit pressured lah it's not macam I'm not looking for a job all like I enjoy being at home and not doing anything
I kalau I pergi balik pun I tak nak jadi manager anymore lah it's very it was very shitty
and then sekarang pun they already increase um part-time punya pay to I think eight
ya I know right then dorang increase I lupa lah I punya pay berapa but I think I was paid nine for a manager role
sebab I can send simon to work
and then I boleh pergi kerja dari sana because he cannot ride to work mah
ya then only during this course yang they kasi him ride his bike tapi he's he's gonna end his course soon on twenty
err tak tahu eh he cakap nak naik bus tapi naik bus is very very far for him
ya is jauh gila
ya then cakap nak boleh tak kalau kita tinggal dekat rumah your
kita kat sana kita tinggal kat hall seh babe kat tilam and then for five days you wanna
like kita ada our own macam room at bishan and then macam I I don't feel comfortable lah kalau macam everytime I'll have to like sleep in in the hall
with him then macam no privacy you know
ya then I say don't want lah like I don't mind to macam pagi-pagi you ambil I punya bike you pergi sungei gedong then after that I from there I go back my mum's place is okay lah for me I mean at least he doesn't have to like wake up so early to take the bus cause he he punya reporting time is pukul like tujuh sometime enam setengah then pukul berapa nak keluar rumah you know

ya mandai but it's lagi lama lah lagi maybe around one year one point five years
cause dorang tak kasi ride bike right abeh macam orang regular seh ya exactly the dia punya tempat kerja tu tak kasi the naik motor like everyone in dia punya
uh what do they call name battalion I guess err tak boleh naik motor you can only naik public transport atau you take your own car
ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I belum kerja seh kita belum apply rumah belum kerja then you nak talk about having a car
a'ah I think you you you nak kena fikir about it's not just about petrol tau about like dia punya season parking berapa dia punya road tax berapa
ya that's why dia punya season parking dia punya ah apa what's that called ah road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like ah
I don't know I tak tahu apa is going on in his head that he thinks
ya macam I find tak
makes sense lah if you nak if you nak apa ni ah restrict from uh riding bikes it's fine but he works there for five days abeh lepas tu kau tak kasi orang tu naik motor abeh lepas tu kau suruh orang tu naik bus
tak boleh because this thing is not um macam baru baru jer they say oh you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this macam they don't want to change it lah
ya it's damn kesian ah I see
then after that dia cakap nak bangun pagi nak naik bus jauh sia babe even I nak balik rumah I'd rather take my motorbike go home to choa chu kang apa lagi dia yang nak kena pergi kerja
dah lah satu bus jer pergi sana abeh it's also together with like the
ya and bus kat that that bus nine seven five tu oh my god
they dah lah tak cater the bendy bus or the double decker bus and then it's always full you have to like miss two or three buses to to like ya
mm mm ya you're not really affected by macam
like the economy but I mean affected a bit lah it's not like you retrenched lah macam bonus dia tak dapat for mid-year bonus
ya civil servant kan tak dapat
err dia kena retrenched
with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit macam
macam it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
tapi tak tak confirmed juga apa kalau we masih hold the wedding in december cause like I don't think the government is gonna like move into phase three
oh ya ya ya tapi
hais just I I I macam nak cancel the malay wedding honestly ah tak kesah also to like ah don't have the malay wedding
no I serious I tak kesah pun not to have the malay wedding sebab
leceh sia babe like already kahwin sia like it's no point I don't see a point in having a malay wedding anymore
but I already nikah macam tak tak perlu sia
just tak perlu lah babe serious I dah nikah abeh lepas tu um
ya I tahu I cakap that you know I have a baby next year but you know you never know when you have a baby and then kalau I let's say eh around maybe uh next month or what by december perut I dah besar babe like macam mana nak naik pelamin then kalau in that case I betul-betul pregnant by the time I nak ada a majlis
I punya perut dah besar then I nak kena tunggu I beranak dulu
I dah beranak I nak kena tunggu lagi I punya confinement nak kena settle down my my child and then bila nak ada the wedding tak perlu
I nak pergi nak suruh tolong
I pergi sengkang punya
I nak pergi lah nak appeal lah suruh dorang return I punya deposit lah sebab um dorang tak kasi I punya deposit balik
oh my god I punya I punya catering did I tell you about it
I punya catering oh my god was so freaking difficult they were so difficult with me
so at that point in time boleh ada uh majlis kan
so I punya invitation is two three hundred
so uh that time government kasi sampai two hundred and fifty so you can still have a wedding and everything
ah so I cakap dengan dorang lah ah err okay I still nak go on with the wedding ah tapi invitation two hundred fifty and I tak minta balik I punya duit cause I paid for three hundred pax right so I tak minta balik the fifty that um I paid for tapi I nak you
um macam
err so I I just say that lah then dorang cakap uh they almost made me sign the contract and then say that okay boleh kita boleh err have the wedding tapi all the social distancing shit ah you settle
ya so ambil temperature semua you settle
mana boleh gitu sia babe
ya and then apa ni I paying you extra tau then after that dia cakap ah
ya dia punya contract basically saying kalau betul you punya wedding ada um COVID case ah you kena handle everything by yourself so I don't want to take liability for this at all ya and then dia cakap um
kita still akan cook three hundred pax for you
ya so basically saying I'm going to ah I'm still gonna give you what uh you paid for tapi everything else kau settle like if there's anything that happens during your wedding you are liable for it the bride and groom liable for it and they made me sign the
tak lah I tak go on ah then after that uh they I think dorang tak rugi sebab that time kan tutup
then dorang tak boleh beli their barang from there what so they have to buy it from singapore what
and then after that I cakap dengan dorang lah I give like kata putus like that I say um
kalau sampai end of the year ah I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money sebab if you think about it eh duit yang I down dengan dorang belum pakai tau
like you all tak beli barang basah
like basically you all tak tak tak pakai ah duit tu
then the the basically you didn't spend ah my money I'm just paying for the instalment nasib baik I tak pay full ah dorang
so dorang punya dorang punya
I don't know sebab I dah bayar up until the last payment so that one is the after after wedding
because the payment pasal dah nak dah nak my wedding seh masa tu
ya I bayar I think err
cause three payments only I make three payments then the last payment is like after the majlis itself lah
ya so I dah bayar dorang
photographer yang dah bayar I still ada mak andam yang dah bayar
um for malay wedding ya that's all kompang I dah bayar as in like I already deposit lah
so I think maybe if if I tak pergi and tulis I punya deposit maybe almost eight K
ya ya exactly like no service is delivered how can you say macam they suffered losses like what losses there was nothing delivered
macam I tak touch anything I tak touch anything at all then how what what losses are you talking about when you didn't deliver anything there was no services delivered I didn't get any product

boleh lah boleh lah takleh gi dah
buat crochet jer kan tapi aku macam nak try
benda other than just macam bag pasal aku nak jual a few bags
tapi macam I want to try cardigan lah skirt
tapi aku takut because I need like macam time to try it out
macam model it out you know takut dia macam for sizes and all so
to macam
advise me on the sizing and then macam so what kind of design people is interested in
cause I don't have like banyak content cuma aku aku post apa yang aku ada dulu
tapi tu pun aku buat untuk aku punya self bukannya orang beli then macam
sekarang ni orang yang beli pun kawan-kawan aku jer I don't know how to macam reach out to
because you know Instagram ada yang promote punya function tapi kena bayar aku tak ada duit dah lah aku tak
uh hobby punya expenses kan so ya
but tak ada duit so what's the things yang kau nak try
aku start pasal aku ada duit kan so aku the first step I did was aku beli mesin
that step I felt very macam alamak abeh sekarang kena beli kain kena beli ruler
but I I still have not macam masuk class atau macam any course yang will teach me
professional way ya so I think itu pun aku nak kena belajar so kalau if you want to join me
I think we can always join yang macam you know the SkillsFuture kind of thing
yang I saw at Instagram the one that you I send you that time then you were like uh but you don't even know how to draft why would you join you know that there's a lot of level right
aku nak join the highest level the terus buat baju kurung that one you know
yang that time I was interested in that time when we want to go the open house
I think that one also have like course it's not like serious schooling but is like macam after school uh part time I think we can join that
I mean for now if you if you really want to learn you can borrow like you can you have your parents punya
ya aku pun rasa sama I think that's why I started my shop because I've been following so many macam kedai dorang semua sama like I don't know what I think I there's like a certain time
and if you all no no offence there's like a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon ah they hyping all these kedai too much no offence
I saw one kedai dorang jual tote bag like
like basic gila tote bag dia abeh ada macam embroidery macam
macam pathetic ah to me no offence it's not like high skill level embroidery but it's like sixty dollars and people all buy and it's like sold out I'm like oh my god like I can do so much better
and some more kita kan daripada artistic punya course
ya that's why that's why um apa ni
that's why because because dekat Instagram they always like
up it up within like people of our community we always kita selalu macam bilang you are artist you you gonna charge
punya harga mahal it's a piece of art it's a service people not tak semua orang boleh buat benda gitu pe
so just charge lebih jangan jangan cause some more kalau kau charge low nanti other artist kena macam compare macam then the customer macam kenapa orang ni murah kenapa kau mahal gila
ya that one satu lah itu betul
apa ni benda-benda simple gitu
okay lah like I I guess rezeki dorang lah you know but then the the machine is it embroidery machine atau machine just help you stitch atau
is it tulis letter punya atau
mm mm pasal my brother dia selalu buat commission work
so orang yang order dia punya commission work is like kawan dia banyak kawan dia atau cikgu dia
tapi dia pergi charge murah seh like A four
oil paint eh not oil acrylic punya paint they charge twenty dua puluh dua puluh dolar jer hello I'm
untuk dia senang lah memang untuk dia senang dia dia draw satu kali satu malam pun dah habis
so dia cakap tak akan aku nak charge mahal-mahal tapi dia cakap
benda ni bukan banyak orang boleh buat lagipun orang there's people out there yang charge benda mahal-mahal kenapa kau just macam
aku agaknya tak confident lah eh macam insecure macam aku nak jual tote bag aku berapa
macam mahal sangat kawan that kind of thinking you know
but ya so I think kita people like us kalau nak
buat benda-benda gini we should just do because we I don't think we have like necessary knowledge in macam style no offence
and we if we if we create a trend right people will follow that kind of thing macam no offence like
like Instagram shops now locals semua macam they all have the same style
scrunchie ada banyak kedai scrunchie
pasal scrunchie senang nak buat
just uh just kain straight abeh kau tahu getah abeh jadi scrunchie ya
boleh lah
tak professional
but I like how macam sekarang punya Instagram shop is like a baru punya like a new platform to jual and you don't have to take rent right itu satu
macam kedai physical kedai ah tapi dorang pun aku follow a few kedai yang buat baju
so kau kau beli dia jahit dia tak jahit dia tak stock up
so kau kau beli pastu dia jahit pastu you can
baju ya I think that's very important
satu kali ni aku nak tidur abeh aku teringat eh I can't believe people throw around that that that term free size
apa kejadah tu free size
how can anybody have the same baju badan like kalau macam aku dengan kau kita bukannya
size jauh sangat tapi kau kan tinggi sikit
M S S tu pun macam okay at least you got like a few even though is like usually just S M and L
ya what about all those people yang tu macam kecil sangat atau besar sangat dorang kena dorang kena macam
apa ni grief give up sacrifice their style just for their size like very sad
which is like lagi mahal lah
ah tu pasal
lagipun sekarang macam kita our world or our like I don't know maybe people around us or my generation kan
kita more to macam a sustainable lifestyle
so banyak orang choose to beli
local atau secondhand atau thrift tapi
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand atau hand me down dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju kan kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal
itu boleh boleh senang untuk orang yang badan macam smaller than people so kalau banyak orang yang macam
besar sikit then macam mana dorang nak like
sustainable dorang nak macam oh macam long don't buy from fast fashion tapi actually fast fashion pun baju semua kecil lah tapi
ya that's why aku suka sangat dengan this new macam trend of kedai Instagram yang buat
custom fit is I think is very important I think kalau aku boleh jahit I think that's one of my goal macam
I like it's always at the back of my head to buka kedai baju lah actually tapi just I don't have the necessary
skill tapi kalau aku boleh aku nak seh aku suka gila kalau aku buat baju kurung dekat kedai like yes
like yes the baju really is your baju it hugs like is really like your shoulder size your your apa
your apa ni
and like lagipun baju yang tailor is always last longer
tahun pasal kan ada tag ada nombor tau and nombor dia belum nombor singapore yang
modern punya you know macam nine tu ya number dia lima or something like that how old is that ya
pasal pasal um
thrifting the word just the word just thrifting kan thrift is macam cheap murah
so kalau kau sustainable is when you buy something that already exists tapi macam at the same time
ah so you don't have to buat benda baru so it's not wasteful lah kirakan tapi kalau vintage vintage is more of like a collection
is mahal hundred dollars for a T-shirt for people apa seh T-shirt one hundred dollar tapi macam is
it got it got apa ni is valuable is got context ah there there's a history to it
uh uh abeh yang thrifting ni secondhand murah macam kat lucky plaza pasal is
people tak nak I feel like value a a a object is based on the
people nak ke tak nak is demand versus supply lah that's what makes the price
so ya I think kalau orang confuse I think why why is it so confusing
you just see the price kalau two dollar that's not vintage macam
oh ya lagipun
benda yang kita kena tanya ni actually kenapa baju sekarang murah
what makes it so like orang orang tanya kenapa kenapa mahal tapi dorang tak pernah tanya kenapa murah
cause there's actually a cause behind that murah you know
until very sad that's why aku macam sekarang aku dah hundred percent
uh prevent myself daripada beli baju dari Uniqlo Cotton On
ya actually aku tak beli baju baru lah actually pasal
actually no offence tapi kau kasi aku banyak baju and baju kau semua lawa semua my size like I want to give people like I want to macam kasi kasi tapi alamak lawa pula pakai lah
abeh satu kali satu kali ni aku keluar family aku dorang semua pakai baju kau sia
you give me I I wish orang lain pun ada this kind of macam relationship with friends atau macam macam
nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung kan dia orang kampung boleh gather baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil
dia kasi aku so aku selalu ada these people around me yang akan kasi baju but then I I don't think other people
so got a lot of people cause I some sometimes I ada orang tanya aku pasal this sustainable lifestyle like they want to try also then they say
how how to get baju yang macam
bukan fast fashion and how do you even know
ya people always shit on fast fashion tapi actually fashion industry as a whole is very
bad tapi susah lah kan tapi ya I also don't have macam
much to say other than macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau tu jer
ye pasal kan actually kalau kau fikir fikir balik kan all this um wasteful punya life
cepat sangat is like so fast like it's sudden
macam actually kita yang boleh nampak lah the drastic changes actually dulu-dulu
did you know that plastic bag was created by the swedish lelaki dia nak create plastic bag pastu dia nak
dia nak he wants it to be a more sustainable uh alternative tau
dia tak nak pakai tree dia tak nak pakai paper bag pasal is from trees
abeh dia tak nak pakai macam cloth bag because it's uh to produce cotton you need a lot of water
so plastic bag is macam oh macam senang kau boleh lipat taruk dalam poket boleh pakai lagi tapi orang
kita salah guna lah kita ada convenience kita buang after every use which is
crazy to me disposable how can satu benda kau buat susah-susah
terus kau buang plastic bag macam factory kena
lagi kalau kau belajar chemistry you know how all this thing is created daripada element dorang semua
kalau if you really look from the root kan kau macam oh my god I can't believe I throw that after one use you know
so going back to yang cakap pasal kedai Instagram and orang sekarang banyak buat benda
the uh it's a like bagus yang orang sekarang uh try their best untuk belajar all these skills balik buat apa ni
just buat benda-benda simple lah tapi at least dorang ada apa
ada berusaha untuk buat benda-benda gini once you buat you akan
hargai you know how to appreciate like how how it's being made and then
once you because we are so jauh daripada the the process we don't see it the process of doing all this that's why people kita tak
tak macam eh a'ah eh macam mana macam sayur sayur orang tanam susah-susah pagi-pagi bangun abeh kita tak makan kita tepikan buang
it's actually not our fault lah it's just how time has changed abeh macam tapi alhamdulilah kita dapat this
ilham this know in our head that we get to apa ni
belajar lah just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
we we can lagipun kita bukannya sustainably more aware jer I think we just more aware of everything
satu satu pending belum bayar
agaknya lah
is it lagi mahal dorang akan
macam kat mana-mana advertisement tu or what
explore page nanti ada keluar kan
explore page ada macam yang fashion
shopping all that tu kan
pasal actually ada satu dua orang tanya macam berapa gitu tapi dorang overseas then
actually I can I can ship overseas tapi dorang macam oh okay thank you pasal I I think they prefer to buy local lah obviously leceh kan
cause actually crochet kat singapore ada a few kedai crochet kat singapore you know the farah lola that one
ya that one but then it's like to me I don't really like singapore punya crochet punya
design design wise they more like for public friendly eh macam colour dorang macam
black grey tapi crochet it's still crochet but it's just like not as like my style lah
ya it's not like quirky ya pasal kat banyak seh kedai
macam banyak gila and it's all so cute and I like most of it I like inspired from from dorang ah
aku tengok dorang that's why aku nak macam I think that's a good thing about social media kau tengok alamak what am I doing so kau pun
lagipun kedai tu dia actually she used to work at kedai kain pastu pandemic kedai tu tutup
so dia selalu bawa balik kain yang dorang tak nak tau just scrap it's it's kirakan scrap tapi banyak lah
so dia bawa balik abeh dia collect over time abeh waktu pandemic ni dia jahit
dia jahit bag just simple bag it's all shoulder bag
lagipun dia dia baru graduate daripada university of textile or something like that ah
so I like her rezeki like so good lah pasal dia start baru waktu tu yang quarantine tu
abeh banyak orang beli habis tu sekarang all of her kain is dead stock
you know dead stock kain like no more like it's just orang tak nak macam she's already
her lining all recycled uh ah not recycled apa ni
cute she make it cute lah then the kain not that cute tapi she make it cute
abeh sekarang dia ada lagi satu size kau nampak
size dia panjang sikit sling dia abeh it's like big
ya alamak I think one day aku beli ah
tapi susah nak order tu dia drop terus kau kena order
pasal dia punya collection dia tak akan buat balik pe dia satu kali jer
aku pun nak buat gitu tapi kalau buat gitu then aku kena constantly come up with new things
kau tahu tak tapi kalau orang nak yang itu aku macam ah okay lah aku buatkan kau pasal I obviously I want money right
aku cuma buat aku tak tahu apa plan for my
aku pun nak buat gitu but then
aku punya followers tak banyak sekarang so
tu lah actually kau tahu farah lola kan dia punya design satu jer
cuma colour lain
so like everytime dia nak buat kan they just buat that thing and it's like how to say ah
design dia satu jer so kalau imagine
and she will drop that thing she will drop and say okay hari ni aku jual hari ni korang boleh pre-order
order that ah senang kalau kau punya design satu jer
so you can keep doing that same design so you can stock up lah kirakan aku nak made to order actually if can that's why it's a bit
so like that's why ya aku hundred percent will like
I don't know how long it can last tapi macam kalau ada kain it will be more durable
it will be more durable tapi kalau cardigan kan there's not much weight to it kau taruk kat badan kau pe tapi kalau bag kau letak botol
taruk botol tapi it will stretch ah eventually no matter how tight I make it you know
ya then macam quite fun lah because aku follow a few crochet punya kedai and they all so supportive they always share story of the design they like
then got this one kedai she daripada philippine then she say oh uh
uh reply this if you are kedai then I will promote what um the my my best the the my favourite post of you abeh since aku buat tu dia dia
post kat dia punya story abeh like a few crochet philippine punya account also quite cute ya
just happy to see orang singapore
creative so kita
ya even tengok orang pakai baju pun sedih I mean like bukan baju lawa tapi then macam err selipar pakai seluar pendek
tak boleh aku pet peeve ah
knit ke knit
kawan aku buat accounting punya course
sorry maths aku
kau interested dengan benda ni
actually aku nampak banyak job posting dekat job street about
ya I think kalau kau join kerja sekarang with that related job I think kau boleh start dari sana
like you don't have you don't really have to study like ya an alternative lah lagi kau hands on ah ya
arts arts kalau tak ada pandemic pun orang tak nak tapi the need for it lah
dorang ada tuesdays with morrie
abeh ah while the rest ada I don't know ah this city city got show I don't know what is it
I was supposed to uh kerja untuk hotel tau
you know hotels has the such a big show it's like the biggest show like selalu cakap kalau kau boleh kerja hotel kau boleh kerja apa-apa
production pasal is like four hours long like that then like the dresser is A and B you know
so kau ada shift so like oh my god aku takut lah waktu dia cakap ah you want to go hotel then I'm like yes but then I just yes cause I need job right
nasib baik tak ada tak tau nasib baik ke tak
kalau ya seram tapi kalau ya pun wah macam what an opportunity right ya
ya like hotel banyak gila cast then like all the cast is like
orh the third aku baru tengok crazy rich asians
okay lah cerita dia mm not my type lah
awkwafina pun vietnam eh ke korean
entah lah but they just take all and all kind of asian they can take in hollywood lah
okay lah I guess they we're going somewhere the representation tapi macam nampak force sikit ah
and this thing waktu tu aku dengan kakak aku adik aku macam heated heated argument
do we really want representation kalau representation gini macam hijab
macam okay kalau korang step macam diverse tapi macam there's not much
depth into that diversity just macam show off yang oh
show kita ni diverse then macam
some more like apa ni
if like if you kalau kau include orang pakai tudung like just example
kau tak payah taruk plot there something like culture what you don't have to keep like throwing to the audience like oh she's the muslim she's a she's a muslim like can you just like
talk about her like any other character macam okay macam do more about her personal punya character development whatever orh tak payah macam
cina jer cina jer ni martial arts
macam can you really you can just make a show cerita apa yang bagus
cerita ni a good place quite good ah good place
like they never even they never really macam
cause ada ni kan jamil is it is that what you call her
jameela apa nama dia the yang manny
ah nama dia jason jason ah yes
cerita tu tak payah macam force it's not force what but if if you really look at the cast macam quite diverse what
but that one tak macam oh
oh you know tak payah
cerita apa eh
it's bodoh
I saw someone I I saw a interview you know anthony padilla from smosh last time dia interview siapa perempuan tu yes
so dia ada buat porn pakai tudung abeh oh my god it's like so
macam how to say it's like very popular so it says a lot you know
oh my god sia I mean like it it's not kesian ah actually aku dengar interview dia sedih
dia buat sikit jer sia
dia cakap dia buat macam six video or whatever ah like macam ya
okay lah tu lain cerita ah
it's just perempuan dengan lelaki just different
no kalau kalau if you ever come across lelaki yang like like bothered by this
let's say he he he want to macam argue no lelaki pun but no don't even argue because
kalau kau bukan orang tu kalau kau bukan part of that
uh group you shouldn't be sort of defensive what kita bukan punya
kita bukan cakap yang kau kau pervert kau semua pervert bila masa cakap gitu
kita just cakap what's fact it's been decades since
macam tak payah cakap isn't it obvious macam adik aku sometimes gitu pasal adik aku dia
dia annoyed with modern feminism dia cakap
macam you know all this perempuan yang bogel kat street dekat lah all this but then you you shouldn't you shouldn't look at the at the
surface you shouldn't look at the surface tu apa dorang buat jer tapi you should really look at the cause the issue you know ni macam jauh sikit tapi aku nak compare pasal aku suka tupac kan
suddenly tapi banyak orang macam oh black people they are gangster cakap pun macam
pekik-pekik maki-maki each other tapi dia cakap dia there's there's one thing he say very like really got to me he say if you cannot
like the problem is dorang like how they even become like that you know
you know macam how perempuan become so aggressively err berbogel ni ah why they make it until that point you know
ya sedih apa abeh lagi malay drama's not helping
ya allah I don't know how at this day of age people can still produce that kind of show
kahwin contract
malay punya drama kahwin jer itu dorang punya conclusion eh kau tak nak kahwin nanti kau tak boleh kahwin itu jer
oh my god kahwin sia apa-apa problem kau ada kau kahwin
and kalau tak ada anak tu tak apa and like ni semua lain orang punya masalah lain tapi you should really look at the rezeki that you have
instead of we don't have I mean like memang manusia biasa kita selalu macam apa yang kita tak ada we really look
instead of buat cerita suruh orang kahwin kenapa tak buat cerita suruh dorang hargai apa yang dorang ada what the shit eh sorry
abeh nyai aku tengok ketawa-ketawa abeh nyai aku I don't know if she like it or she just like amused by how bad it is
pasal aku suka tengok cerita korea korea is like more in depth like they have a lot of issues
people always say eh you know very sad you know eh nak kat habis eh apa tu kita habis
eh D dah lama tak jumpa uh awak sekarang tengah buat apa ni
alamak uh lynn sekarang tengah kerja kat catering kitchen ah buat kerja part time tapi kalau you nak kerja uh I boleh ajak you kerja lah awak nak tak
alamak kesian
kena the hijab then later got stains all those germs mah so maybe they might be concerned with that but then I think they can always uh how to say they can prepare like a modified version of the hijab such that it not only helps to protect the muslim nurses but it also allows them to do their job right I think that is one way that they can do and I know that recently they have been talking about that
but you make a promise what to meet her at two like I mean if you are going to be late you can always inform her lah like I'm going to be late so you can macam meet later or you can meet schedule another date ke apa then this one he make her wait
oh no wonder lah you keep messaging me want to go matchmaking cause you want to avoid that situation then I was like thinking why this girl always nak cari boyfriend lah cari husband then I'm like want to go matchmaking together I a bit segan lah
I know what you can do you can go to the mosque and find any imam and then say abang tolong saya
oh my god I feel I feel so weird right now you have so many interesting experiences with people who like you I don't have much but I think I have one story lah it was during my project so um my diploma we collaborated with like engineering students so we have to do like auditing at uh low income households kat yishun ah not really at yishun it's like canberra yishun area so um we were having a briefing and then I was like

that's the thing lah that's as good as me using your name abeh aku tak bilang kau macam eh ah nak pinjam duit
you know aku secretly put you as the macam kau applicant ah without without your consent
tu shitty thing to do kan
abeh kawan aku tu gi geylang dengan dia cakap macam
not really doesn't have a place macam I dare not kind of thing macam kau lah basically
aku didn't really bitch at him about it lah aku tak macam bising ke apa lah aku tak
like I wasn't really angry at him I I told I told him upfront aku I I said
I'm not angry at you aku more concerned rather than angry lah cause I was not in the receiving end of this ah so it's fine lah
cause that time pun the previous issue pun he didn't tell me then I found out aku pun pissed ah I told you already not to do that anymore
macam it's addictive what
yes of course it got stolen abeh lepastu he was really bummed out about it
am thinking lah what to do now abeh ada other ah ada issues as well
no he borrowed me money abeh lepastu aku trying to recoup back the amount that he took
bab tu lah he's going to pay back I hope lah eventually
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us ke
from what aku understand ah my wife said the same thing you get me
farid cakap he would just salam me and just cam balik
I mean okay lah it's true ah macam you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
ah aku aku do feel that every time aku hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress ah now they divorced kan
aku every time
aku do feel
what I shouldn't be there okay lah kim said it perfectly ah cakap
I don't want to validate this relationship tapi I don't want to say macam eh you cannot hang out with us ah
macam I want to hang out with him
but then eventually what I did was aku just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
lupa ah good names
twenty twelve I think ah aku don't really remember exactly
tapi eh eh anal lah then okay anyways stress ah aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas think
cakap please boleh astagfirullahaladzim
tapi kalau just the
okay let's say it was just aku fahim and
lupa ah good names okay whatever lah bukannya ah okay anyway aku fahim and mistress lepak just the three of us the whole time
tapi this one whole group
tak usually we will know though
I mean initially my wife was worried lah dia cakap
what if you get tempted to you know macam add in to the dark side aku dah macam
to be fair kan aku only met his now ex wife lah very very few times I think
abeh kalau dia punya bad points aku rasa
she is too deep in this mentality where aku tak tahu it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before cakap macam
you know they don't have eh eh concrete plan to do whatever lah cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial ke emotionally or both usually both lah
ya ya okay it is controversial tapi
but aku I I don't know why I I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating ah this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family punya background dia macam financial background ah more than anything lah of course lah that plays a huge part
tapi okay ah to be fair
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not lah I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her aku rasa dia punya other other point
she aku tak tahu eh fahim ah probably it is ah maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is macam he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not macam many many many times
ya ya aku agree lah I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
aku macam how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
tak tahu ah
no some apa no no surprise lah where you came from like which country you came from
aku rasa that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
aku believe kan the country could do much better if the royal family
invest in infrastructure in country lagi sikit cakap company
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come abeh lepastu boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on ah
but they don't so aku found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
other things ah macam wan ah
so aku macam find that to be very thought superficial is one thing lah the other one is
lama sia
kau okay you you talk to the guy before kan
aku tak tahu lah abeh oh anyway dia cerita cerita abeh then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
aku dah macam please lah get on to your next point lah
ah aku tak tahu eh
tak tahu ah
ah aku find that
takpe why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial lah eh he said this one line ah aku macam palm his face ah he said you know initially I thought
aku dah macam eh kau don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me lah sia
aku dah macam eh kau please please please don't give me a
macam there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see lah for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue ke tak if it's what you really want then go for it of course lah no one listens to my advice pe aku kan just an apa
which which she should have done from the start ah aku tak tahu kenapa she still engaged to follow him around
aku just find that very creepy
takde anything anymore together asal kau do this also I don't know
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying oh my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much macam you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her lah
macam aku don't agree with the mentality ah ada orang cakap oh tak lah ni semua kerja perempuan macam eh
ah ni ni untuk kau
tak you know some people would step up ah dorang macam believe that they are better at it
yes I do only aku only one t-shirt aku don't iron
it's good to have one kau at least buy a steamer ah
masai sia tak iron
um so aku
you know lose not losing weight apa
he said he was at her play ah their place ah her place there there so long if he was their place he and din this mat salleh melayu aku very confused
his balding tak penting ah but
both of them went over to fahim place abeh ah ruqayyah was asleep
macam aku gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain lah cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared sia to the point where aku realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it lah I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing macam
ya lah I I know lah but macam you can tell what there's a huge difference when you look at the photo macam from six days ago ke ten years ago
then macam
I really gain like twenty kilo sia macam you can tell lah pe the difference
I think for me aku at most gain about
ten around ten aku actually gain more initially then I aku started losing weight
aku controlling my food intake these days
aku don't really care what I eat more of
ya macam let's say aku the the trick is to have your breakfast as late
then the second meal let's say if you eat macam merepek minang ah aku just had minang again yesterday best decision ever
lepastu end up kau confirm lapar pe
ah minang then at night aku makan cereal
aku started at sixty six
tak not there's some most nya chart would say aku average ah
oh local nya eh
yup you have a point ah pasal the whole ya shouldn't have
I should look into the maybe atau kalau malaysia nya pun boleh pakai lah
aku tengok benda-benda bodoh macam dia cakap nanti ah
aku tak tahu ah
kau lain ah
ya takleh cakap sekarang
then they took a took a picture lepastu aku perasan macam
eh aku dah gemuk gila ke apa
then I macam
ya I show you before ya which which is good lah then I was not expecting that turn ah which really changed everything ah aku stop drinking sweet things exclusively I used to drink flavoured drinks exclusively and I stop
there's a while aku really crave teh then aku macam okay lah we go buy teh then I think so okay ah
not so lah couldn't not really heavily addicted to food kau tahu macam people some eat a lot of gluttony gonna shit I don't lah
german nya the vacuum guy
I think so but I forgot or you never did I am not sure apa dia apa dia buat
sardin pe
like some people tak change their passport semua they just
change for the heck of it macam kau tahu you get the conversion card kan
macam grudgingly ah
oh as in the whole ah like handling the zakat
oh ya ya ya tu aku agree ah I have to agree with that correct
so ni semua subjective pe
siapa they both
your dad ke your mum
who she she tak
is it one of those macam trial lessons
no some people think of it that way macam are you sure you want to stoop this low and want to marry asian some people which fucked up lah but then some people really think of it that way I can do it
ah so aku tak tahu ah macam maybe just tell her that
tapi if I know switzerland is doing ke australia forgot like german speaking country it's not
orh I'm okay ah tapi lately rabak ah because uh apa ni COVID kan so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
atau just uh watch new dramas lah basically
correct correct then the one that I regret the most sekarang is uh apa ni the one that you invited me to watch ah demon slayer
for me personally right ah uh aku bukan a fan of apa ni macam cute cute uh type of err art style for the err anime for me I prefer like macam semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret gila serious because it's like uh the storyline bagus and then like dia punya action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away ah so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right uh it was
that's why but err but err adding on to yang the older punya animes even initial D pun kan it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then macam it got so much hype and like so much um err attention right it just blows my mind ah ya and I really thought it's it's really nice lah and
not gonna lie ah it's very rare um for this kind of err shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause ah the part yang
err I think is the one yang the second episode yang dia pergi bunuh the very big demon then he touch the head
uh ya the the the one who killed the punya kawan
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was um the apa moon that got strip of his uh power pasal dia tak uh eat enough humans the one who use the drums ah
ya uh I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then tak ada orang appreciate dia so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
uh terkesan like I was like shocked lah when I cried a bit I was like eh tak pernah pernah macam gini the last time I cried was like err what endgame
kompang kompang gitu
err tapi tapi stress ah yang err dia punya battle tu the other one that err was more stressful was the punya the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
sekali a one time slash then mati
that's why tak fair gila serious
ya ya even the intro dia punya what they call it opening I don't know opening ah the opening was also quite macam blood pumping ah for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally eh for you is the music kan for me is the ah story line itself
um uh give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect macam dia tak just bunuh cause oh you're a demon cause err he take the time to like understand them look back ah look through their memories and then like say like eh you used to be human lah so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
I I kind of uh apa ni regret a bit right apart from um not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that err to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime ah like macam I look macam ah sometimes look at the art style macam very cutesy cutesy dia macam takda substance to it ah but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some animes are good it's not everytime macam those like uh act cute atau macam very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the animes are really damn good so aku macam semi regret so for me personally ah for demon slayer right I started on naruto
um ah I know it's one of the best animes but draggy gila it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch ah but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also ah the day before pasal one piece so that one will try so I start naruto first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer naruto or one piece ah actually
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes lah so it's not too not too macam mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya tapi are these sorry is this the format for err anime like each episode got twenty minutes atau
oh kira macam movie is it
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm hilang ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking ni kan sekarang ah apa ni uh I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
ya I see your math semalam jer dah tak boleh tahan that's why I I don't take math
correct correct yang semalam you show me the pasal apa tu row operation that one obviously I try ah but I really I really don't understand lah but the first few question I understand lah ya
ah something like that ya ya but sorry my math tak bagus sangat
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you ah force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself tak faham then you have to like uh you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt juga
yeah I guess macam uh if like you if you like tanya then like you didn't try then think macam people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really kalau macam we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about uh your course is that uh at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally rabak gila ah ah I take english but then like err if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment juga
ya ya cause mak kau cikgu ya ya ya that's why it's it's true ah like I I always thought I had the mindset like boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri just belajar jer just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you ah they call it um crystallisation of your thinking like make your uh ah word flow much more uh smoother ah in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya eh tak tak I I saw in my study guide apa crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation uh like um basically they encourage macam um making study groups and all that cause for me like uh like you err yourself ah aku pun introvert that time um when I want to try ask macam malu-malu cause I feel paiseh ah like macam
oh kira macam the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe ah
in a way ah in the same time at the same time from what you explain macam is to juggle the perasaan of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
um some um I think it's very rare lah that there are people who are very macam clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to jaga hati and try to be more mindful what they say
as very um ruthless or very blunt lah macam later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel macam very um
ah that's why that's why rasa kecil hati kirakan ya
ah then when they continue doing that then they don't learn kan they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise asal semua orang keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me masa dulu I was very sensitive so now I try to macam balance out lah
ya can I share one story ya okay pasal I'm guilty of this so err so err err err the the one thing that err you mentioned about time management there is it for me kan honestly speaking ah
balance and all that so I admit ah sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so um before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I uh consulted err my partner and my mother then they said that is fine lah then I think about it macam tak affect my grade cause there was a time before what I failed my exam then my uh drop rabak gila then lepas tu um
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like um if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just err restudy lah and the good thing ah about my school now is that since COVID right uh they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right uh you have to pay the fee tau it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free lah cause of COVID so like I'll just do it lah but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty macam I feel so bad macam kirakan I can clear the mod one then macam I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again uh cause uh the last time I checked if I fail again kan
aku boleh tendang sekolah lah like fully ah I err I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is err academic termination then you have to it's as if err after you kena terminated it's as if you have to err re-enrolled lah to the school so that's the downside lah so I'm like ah I don't wanna take the risk ah I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away kena that kind of
ah ah that's what I kena ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos ah if I'm being honest so like I think about it ah takpe lah just resit ah
I don't want to risk it ya sakit sia hati that time ya
uh are there but how there are different so that um when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english eh I'm if I'm speaking english and kau cakap macam ah there are structures to it that make it different ah I think it's ah sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages ah
ya something like that lah like they have a uh a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences ah ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages ah if like you use uh malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like susah
it's a translation but then like err one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like err the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part ah ya I think there was once I I look err the one that my prof taught me was err apa ni
professor ya sorry err professor ah eh ah so casual panggil prof uh she talk about english in uh do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya allah eh sorry sorry err so basically um
pejabat office right
ah pejabat pos so it's like it's reverse ah so that's the different thing
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it ah so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so panjang right so like ah tau boleh takpe lah just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly uh change it like that like um they just make it english language and literature like um why they don't have the presets cause last time uh when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that um
ya tak comfortable
correct ya cause nanti err it will be natural
for you to start comparing with others tau then nanti macam okay for example you got a posh you nampak orang ni ada Ferrari then you see ah people got um apa Burgundy Burgundy Honda then later you get Burgundy Honda later you got Ducati it never ends tau so like when you keep buying more things like this you think like um err you're making yourself happy cause you are getting everything you want since you are a kid what tapi what you're doing right is you are sort of uh
apa ni putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you
unfortunately he died already ah it's iron man games of thrones tak game of thrones tak that uh one prime uh character in the Marvel uh
uh adding to your part macam uh when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually uh apa ni
belief and then like ah actually um it's not technically a superpower lah but it's more of like it's err apa tu
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing eh cause I just realised this now I'm having this uh eh epiphany macam if you notice eh in endgame
uh black widow and iron man tak ada power tau but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then uh iron man dia uh take the apa tu uh gauntlet from err thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really ah all the efforts for nothing but then like err he managed to get all the infinity stones on his uh hand then he just snap ah so it takes a lot of um courage to do that you know so like it was is is really um mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
ya macam that day jer this is the type of body that you want on the beach oh my goodness
ah dah kurus ya ya
dan cause also um
like it's even more um ah amplified lah I guess lagi lagi malu lah kirakan
tak boleh ah some do play some do play not going to lie tapi um
ya sebab but it's more suited for the mature audience ah
eh tak lari eh topic lari that's why
okay okay takpe takpe go jer
kat mars
dia pergi eh
atau Grab express uh deliver parcel
young ah wah that's a good thing eh like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any apa tu
ya ya orh then err it'll be relatable to uh demon slayer when uh in the movie uh what's his name eh ah correct me if I'm wrong ah asaka ke akaza akaza he wanted to offer uh rengoku to be a a demon what ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die ah so
um if you remain at technically if you get to live forever atau you um remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it uh like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
but probably why ah sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable ah err probably why the apa six demon didn't uh
nama saya nadi
enam tahun whoa
ada contract
jadi sudah sudah tujuh eh enam tahun
dah enam tahun wow
lagi satu tahun tengok lah macam mana
ya betul betul betul
mengidam eh
pasal pasal kita orang duduk tunggu makanan or the bunny chow tak tahu apa akan datang tiba-tiba it's a whole loaf of bread
ya ya and it was recommended ramai orang suruh order
ah cara dorang cakap dengan kita orang macam kawan gitu so kita orang saja lah tanya-tanya eh apa-apa yang sedap tak pernah try ini semua
terus err
apa nama dia pekerja dia suruh try bunny chow terus ada satu customer pun suruh kita orang try bunny chow
terus kita orang try ah ya ingat tak the customer
terus wah it it was the best decision we've ever made
ya kita nak makan banyak kira you know pros and cons kena give give in ya oof
that was quite nice ya the burger cause before that sebelum tu kita orang try ah McDonald's
then saja saja
saja nak try tengok country apa negara lain macam mana dorang punya ah McDonald's
tapi tak tak sedap sangat lah singapore punya standard terlalu tinggi saya rasa
a'ah I I boleh boleh rasa yang ini
ah ye ye ye ye ye
jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni plus kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada community melayu juga
uh jadi kita ingatkan
walaupun err the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
makanan mesti ada mesti ada ah sedikit ah yang sama kan
oh okay I remember ada samosa
ye ke lupa ah oh okay interesting I forgot my memory not good
dah dah dua dua tahun eh
err practise in different ways and then ya I think I think it was it was apa eh
oh oh I remembered inside it was a whole thing like inside there was fries and then there was there was daging and there was cheese it was
it was oh it was basically like roti john but they throw in uh fries also so ya and sayur also so it was like a whole meal with a
dengan ya I remember just taking one bite and felt like I just finished lunch
ya dalam lima minit tiba-tiba makanan dia dah sejuk kan
a'ah tak boleh taruk tepi pun kan
mmhmm pasal ice box<malay>dia ice box dia share nanti takut orang curi kan ya
lepas tu we also didn't want to throw I remember
oh wow tu semua pahadal dah lupa seh now all the memories are like coming back
eat like they didn't have much to eat jadi apa dorang buat is apa-apa dorang boleh dapat all the ingredients bahan-bahan dorang ambil taruk dalam roti terus makan jer
sedap but it was like a it was an experience lah it was really just all at once ya
gila weren't didn't think properly lah basically
mmhmm okay juga
kita orang tak tak bersedia at all ya
terus macam kita orang tengok atas kalau kita tengok atas tengok macam puncak dia masih tak sampai-sampai ah masih jauh lagi dalam hati ke
a'ah lepas tu oh yang yang saya masih ingat is a
on the way up ada satu orang orang ni tengah lari tengah buat morning exercise dia dia tengah bersukan lari naik turun gunung
jadi kita orang fikir eh ni ni agaknya masih masih
masih okay lah agaknya akan sampai lah siapa yang lari naik turun gunung eh
jadi kita orang ah tak jauh mesti tak jauh terus ingat dia ada anjing sekali ikut dia
saya ingat saya fikir dalam hati okay mesti dekat mesti dekat jadi continue naik ke atas continue naik
ah ada tempat duduk
ah dah naik a'ah
dua jam mak ah
ah eh tapi masa dia punya dia punya apa
ah permandangan cantik lepas tu
pun it was a it was quite cold I remember cause it was winter ya so it was
a'ah tu tu lah tu lah
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit
terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba ah angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari eh
a'ah memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa mountain gear tu semua ada yang stick panjang tu ah hiking stick dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja jer jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu
and we just rest and reflect apa kita orang buat tadi
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like ah tak puas cause like
cause I was really curious I actually tengok ah video signal hill macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas grass semua okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
I got I got jio one friend she she also malay okay we all melayu together
lepas tu we could have like walk down almost tour you know
ah gi jalan-jalan
uh uh I remember uh ada makan makanan macam fish and chips
that time kau rasa
like aku masih ingat like for for the trip was mostly the experience and I feel like the
the activities dengan kawan-kawan pasal ah I ingat dalam kita orang naik van lepas tu ada tiga van ada tiga van four is it ah ada empat van dalam satu van ada dalam tujuh atau sepuluh orang
gitu going through puberty
dengan ya kita orang dengan a few other singaporeans right I remember
ah dorang gaduh
ah kita orang walaupun ah
aku ingat ada berapa orang dalam van tak suka budak ni tapi walaupun kita tak suka kita masih baik kita orang tak tak ada dengki ke apa kita cuma
so we we sort of came to consensus that we kita orang akan bersama dalam berapa
trip tu berapa hari ye
ya one week kita orang came up with a consensus we will be together for one week so we should we should get along so even we don't like this boy we try to we try to you know make this
ya he also seem to enjoy it and I know he's aware that a lot of people don't like him lah jadi macam kesian sikit juga lah
okay lah dia minta gambar tak apa
hantar jer
okay to be fair budak tu kalau kita orang kalau kita punya kayak sebelah dia dia akan
dia akan tolak atau dia akan splash water ah lepas tu
ah I ingat that ah I have a fear of uh the sea
so that was not helpful whenever he tolak my my kayak
macam mana nak lukis just bukan lukis saja-saja tau macam lukis macam macam artist gitu
macam boleh dapat kerja like macam graphic design ah
okay pasal adik saya seorang artist jadi hari-hari saya di rumah saya boleh nampak yang
macam uh swimming
at this bridge bridge dia is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
the um tahun lalu I went to krabi dengan kawan krabi okay
like I will be responsible for that jadi jadi I remember after that I
like dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
tak no it was it was it was already like
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes pasal dia punya air air dia clear kan
banana boat ada tu ada lah but
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is kita orang dua bukan orang kayak
and then I remember okay mula-mula there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care lah too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
there's certain places you can kayak right kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar lah but anyway gi kayak dekat
ah tahu tapi kawan-kawan I semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat marina barrage ada kat lakeside pun padahal ada
ya I I actually uh baru belajar macam mana nak float masa kat krabi because err
I suruh ya I suruh kawan saya ah ajar macam untuk sorry lah eh vishu teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
good enough okay jaga diri sendiri
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me ah nadirah jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal
kalau tak nanti ah nanti penat pengsan kau dah lah selalu pengsan kau jangan
ya bawa gula bawa apa protein bar ke apa
I'm like aww tak aku tak bawa
aku terus lupa cause naturally
on the way up cause okay naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari
dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu ah
kita orang ada bayar guide lah untuk bawa kita orang ke atas
lepas tu dorang ada ah ada tempat-tempat tidur
macam this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga kan kita orang lah dua hari naik turun naik eh naik ada
kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal time tu macam june june daerah kita orang daerah southeast asia kan monsoon season kan ah ah terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena stop apa semua and then I remember there were certain point where
ya then she did that but then I remember macam the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
ah dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang
like lima belas twenty
it's like if you there you see the statue is like besar gila so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
ya I don't know I just find it interesting lah but ya lah then I remember after the trip we basically we kita orang tour from the north
the city dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu and just get moving down down down all the way to ho chi minh kind of thing
no lah no me and vishu are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very kasar like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then ah after that err
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her lah ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them lah but agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask oh kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip bukan holiday holiday tau the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know ah like you cannot be too luxurious lah dia macam too suspicious
that kind of thing terus aku ajar naik motor cause aku boleh naik motor kan terus dia kata ah tapi ah kalau orang catch kita orang tak ada license macam mana terus aku macam
siapa nak catch kau sia
ya aku realised just okay siapa nak catch kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku lah apa-apa jadi aku ada license then I was like apa sia kau takut banyak
sana punya orang punya license pun a'ah dorangnya license pun questionable kan
lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
like eh ah oh terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang vietnam jadi dia based her own experience dari situ dia kata kakak I kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia survey seratus orang boleh lah aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia kan satu orang
dia bukan cabut dia macam okay
a'ah plan dia memang until that time jadi ah pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu chill aku dengan dia kita orang jadi good friends terus habis tu ah dia halfway through kena pergi laos
untuk internship
ah kita kena fikir
kita orang kena calculate you know kat depan tu
a'ah tu lah dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi tapi dengar jer ikut jer ya
aku ikut asalkan duit aku tak tak tak buang lepas tu ah jadi budak lelaki tu kena pergi laos untuk internship
and then lagi satu perempuan tu ah yang masalah sikit dia padahal free tapi pasal dia tahu dia tahu yang aku dengan kawan aku memang kawan mungkin dia tahu dia err visitor sorry dia pun sebelum kita orang pergi sana lah dia dah decide yang okay
since budak lelaki ni akan pergi dulu aku pun akan pergi ah jadi jadi macam gitu lah
ah tak payah lama-lama lah okay lah that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya tak payah there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her lah ya
ya banyak tempat
boleh lah dalam masa depan
main balik ah
yang ayam punya rank
hero lama
aku main more to majors tho so
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention aku punya
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told aku actually spend
like at least for me kan aku kena baca all the builds dulu tau dengan tengok video semua before aku main
kalau rank
rank siang my chicken rank
where people think like kita semua
player baru but
aku join lah
cause like if you fight from afar then siapa yang nak fight dekat depan tiada orang
oh ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when kita lolita dengan apa ah
like lolita dengan siapa
um but aku nak try fighter juga ah
ya ya it's the freya it's the fighter and they did dia orang macam revamp freya right but because macam tiada orang like no one really hear nor really plays freya that much so
actually itu aku smash buttons jer bro aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca skill pun
aku just smash smash
tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang lah then like
hmm so the skin pretty lah but the skill not there ah itu itu I think kau main dengan aku punya freya aku think kau pun boleh menang eighteen senang gila
the rank so I think aku just
I also can like ideate do some research on freya sikit jer bukan macam full blast macam aku punya vexana semua yet if you hear my vexana right
menang menang menang all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
um tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat lah some more vexana is like slow kind
so macam easy target gitu macam macam dia orang walking ducks then kau hunt dengan rifle then it's hunting season lah bro so like
shoot shoot jer tapi aku mage so ya aku shoot shoot gini lembat gila tapi target masih kena
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun dia macam
merapek it's like one of those weak
majors but kalau kau tahu main then dia lah tapi kalau kau tak tahu main
then ramai orang panggil kau
apa ah jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
aurora is lembab
dia tahu golek golek jer
vexana burns um dia punya target semua tapi like aurora
macam step lawa jer shiny shiny macam dia setakat over then I dengar eh tak nak nanyi let it go
to jer dia tahu
fighter what is this dragon apa ini dragon rider
eh dia jadi dragon ini bukan jadi dragon rider
entah lah apa lah aku tak pernah nampak character itu ini lah what's in the league
I think kalau ada background music untuk aku punya balmond kan nanti bila dia buat yang ulti itu dengar quack
but okay lor balmond aku think
no okay why aku choose balmond kan because when my sister um she just started playing so you have new characters to play
so aku
okay at least kau sedar diri then boleh lah
kau jangan step jadi tank yu zhong ke apa dragon orang semua ingat kau nak dragon up ke dragon tales
dia macam hype sekarang
ah dia orang dia orang revamp hilda and like really give her
so korang semua recall kan this hilda sneaky dia dekat dalam bush and she's just recovering health consistently
kau tahu kau dalam bush kan then you press this one skill later your speed laju
nanti kau zoom dengan hilda dengan dia punya muscle muscle dia
itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat like kalau ada music background ah nanti dengar
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it mana ada spend ah
simpan pun buat apa ini apa saving account
were to put a real term on hilda it's like all of a sudden kan kau tengah buat kerja
then all of a sudden ada one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right ah semua kan dah ada tempat protector semua
so dah lah habis lah
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then bila mana dia habis kan then
you burn your health then macam like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then kau imagine kau dah tiada mana then kau pun burn down
dah double edged sword lah itu
lost world itu
where as hilda is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise minum protein semua
but I need to practise hilda I so so scared dia orang pun debuff hilda eh cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing hilda
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly dia orang ban macam tak make sense lah
no lah ah ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus dia orang ban siapa like basic gusion
oh cause did not admit cause dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka smash smash button abeh
entah masuk meeting macam mana itu kidding lah
nak buat apa dengan kita punya container tank itu eh
so nak plan macam mana
kita check in abeh tidur
I think I uh I ask him afterwards kita berbual lain lah but then
um okay wait let's go back to the main topic kita staycation

boleh lah time to rank up lah bro
wah so shiok to wake up on a monday to atas view of orchard and eat breakfast in bed in
it's it's in the middle of town but it's like the entrance is ulu but in town like like you cannot find the entrance like if you didn't tell me I wouldn't know where is it
no lah but at the rate like we are walking like ulu hotel entrance but literally in the middle of town is like
I think the only thing you cannot tahan is the toilet because of the frosted glass toilet
their customer their customer base quite like a lot what people go there and makan like I think because lucky plaza is cheap
ya the grandparents are both super cute but I think the grandma like err sit on the chair only but the thing is when you eat there right you cannot like chill chill you know like lim kopi like lunch hour people take their own time
ya ya like it's not like you're eating like super slowly but like sometimes you have the macam the luxury of eating at your own time own target but here maybe if you're not used to how their system is like the first time right the first few times we went we like oh ya cannot own time own target cannot choose your own seat cannot
no not ayam merah the there there is this minang store in lucky
ah indoor and I like because they have this sapi goreng or empal ya ya that one is nice it's not bad I brought risa there she ate like she order all the vegetables I'm like what the hell
because the husband kena heart attack what but that one heart attack in sleep so like she don't want like confirm plus chop she also kena lah
macam over the past twenty years
diabetic sana
she was eating a whole plate of tauge
tahu and all but but the bulk of it is tauge and I'm like she is eating one big plate of tauge I'm like okay healthy people
ya they're forced lah like die die die die must do what because like oh shit people know I've been gym-ing so so it's like if I don't show any result or something like quite lian</mandarin like quite embarrassing lah or like macam you know remember you made this comment about a schoolmate you said ugh she workout so much but don't really see much difference remember
wait so after we eat we're going to go to the Rolex centre cause we atas
at where oh so much for like not atas and then want to shop some more
I am eyeing that item online if I buy outside some more right habis
no if it's white I think I'll wear it only for really like macam events like like events ah
you should wear plain clothes then just wear bright coloured like err hijab so it's not so jialat it's like
jangan berangan lah please
okay you know what if if we don't get it then it's okay we can just err balik I mean like whatever I just if if we if have I will dabao and buy
rabak lah this one if if they tow away no if clams still can remove if they tow away it's gonna be another problem trying to like find the freaking bike cause it's like where is your bike why you why you ya so
chai chee like really bedok chai chee like really very err what's that called it's just really very ulu lah
so if you staycay in dekat town hall to see you
err no merepek lah but six hundred is expensive mahal
mana ada momok it's it's padang what
no it's gonna be operational in jan but leceh because it's malaysia so they're err authorities approval system is all bloody slow it's
like I think you really I don't know lah whether you need to like but then malaysia boleh so everything boleh you just need to have money
the younger ones ah macam the the the kids that are in tertiary education I think there's some of them they still lepak lepak and like
no ada what remember during the circuit breaker the the the
the expat yang is it the group of expat pergi robertson quay
the whole of singapore was watching what like kalau like kalau dorang didn't get send back home eh actually dorang tak kena hantar balik kan
exactly that's why this people expats all rich what boleh bayar
but then again right it's quite bodoh because you think about it ah kita tak boleh gathered in more than five people right but we have offices and
we will see actually I'm used to the mask already in fact I'm glad because if you have breakouts right the mask cover so nobody boleh nampak
yup my cheeks are like oh my god it's like rabak
but then cannot do anything but it's okay lah the mask will cover so uh tutup jer muka and the trick is pakai nice eye makeup so the mata nice like lawa the
I think you shouldn't spoil market when you talk to people right you shouldn't be too empathetic because um nanti orang perasan
no orang akan perasan and orang akan rasa macam eh dia ni caring eh this person boleh dengar aku
no you cannot do this because all these mamat belok ni semua macam um
dorang is it bebal dorang bebal so
and also kalau even kalau macam um oh is that a challenge ya they're going to purposely try like ons you were trying to challenge me right I'm going to see no you cannot do that all this mamat-mamat especially malaysia you must think like the typical melayu
actually I don't get it macam it's only in games mah like you can talk ah but macam why would they make it like you're obligated like why why you must why obligated to reply you at like you supposedly free time
what is favourite buaya
bodoh lah oh my god he
what bila dia nak tidur then he play game and sayang sayang people
tak dia bini bini nanti kalau bini bangun dengar is it bini dia tahu
bodoh lah it's just like cari pasal
husbands game so much ah biar pe tak kasi attention lah tu lah ni lah
interest lor or like um like like their own free time ah you cannot just macam oh aku nak main game tapi kau kena make time for aku macam all that shit lah I don't know
while playing game how is the kid going to be concentrating bapa dia tengah main game
why cannot main game kat rumah
there's bodoh it's just like
ah ya lah dekat kita punya void deck bawah block like the the kind that government makes
dia duduk tepi road untuk main game
macam dekat park or like the estate
just to main game until really late
but then dia main kat keluar dia pakai data
apa tu err is it some flu vaccine thingy the normal one ah
it's only sakit because it's not like
ah I don't want tak nak takut
asal okay now I scared tak nak is uh is wait
no I went to the toilet what then you were telling the story then emilio also said something then I didn't really hear apa
no tapi apa tu kan is like err isn't it like penetration unless they put their whole fist inside then then
exactly so why would you bleed if it's only tangan
I think maybe they should try to lube people when they do pap smear jadi dia lube
tak nak lah give up
nanti aku takut lah like what the fuck oh my god alah now I'm like oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm gonna be like so worried
pekik or not huh
ah okay my tolerance for pain is teruk so I'm like okay now I'm like err oh my god
then I think the the thing about orang-orang yang first time kita semua bela sotong you know right
tak ambil epidural ke
oh the contraction before dia sakit
nak so macam pergi pergi appointment first time semua macam apa tu
err pregnancy first err blur blur pergi appointment husband pun blur blur
pasal awkward
ya nasib kentang pergi clinic seorang orang husband tak nak ikut
I told you what we had this conversation yesterday kan I say kan some husband check-up macam tak nak lah geli lah takut lah nak tengok lah tu lah ni lah tapi semua nak bila nak ambil semua nak
got lubang any lubang also can
everything lubang just lubang
at least the mum ikut I think it like kalau kena
you eavesdrop dengar apa jer
as in budak tu nampak dah pregnant tu tengah oh
tapi the youngest yang aku nampak
she's turning twenty one next year habis anak dia turn seven and I'm guessing tak habis school lah right
unless err defer sekolah atau pergi sekolah until like you're thirty eight thirty
no you can differ what macam skip school for ya lah macam lepas beranak she can pergi sekolah then mak dia jaga lah
fourteen what the hell kau beranak fourteen empat belas tahun empat belas tahun you know it's like teenage pregnancy I usually think right kau beranak like oh my god kau beranak at like enam belas tahun or like maybe uh enam belas tahun onwards kau beranak is still considered teenage mum
kau beranak at empat belas it's like dude I haven't even get my menses I was I was waiting for my menses
err maybe their pull out game rabak lembap atau uh atau err because oral contraceptive kena bayar condom condom actually is the cheapest option already
you bodoh lah just bodoh
eh but then again there are people on or like even the tubal ligation then tiba-tiba mengandung
no sometimes it's quite uh quite err oh ya after the menstrual cycle entah lah tak tahu
and then ya is people all this whatever lah I will I will clap for you if you give birth at like fourteen that's like tak gagak sia
why would you why would you do that tapi kan she signed on to army so is like
empat belas tahun catch no ball with a son to look after
the sperm stay inside bodoh it's like
because when they do sex education we are asian dorang tak nak cakap oh korang tak boleh ada sex with like condom but kids are not stupid they're watching porn eh eight or nine years old
huh but all kids have phone now what you know even if they don't know how to search right you know sometimes like let's say you know like you watch show habis ada pop up
okay so after that the third year engkau move out because with your aunty and then
ya but is it your own your own punya feeling or memang they are the one who gave you hints
tapi when you go back that time uh like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
ya ya but you and her now dah okay lah
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree lah you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life lah mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy lah you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my nakal my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school lah they get into they they start to steal from shop lah that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument ah so aku suka jawab jer you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum lah you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course lah you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you lah you know you ended up becoming a fight often ah but for our case is not religious matters lah for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche lah because she was a single mother for awhile
ah so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so macam ah ya ya so I can understand her stress ah she was the old school hard knocks kind lah you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind lah if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness lah so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and um I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
ah when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two err I stayed at uh you know those government rental house ya I I stayed uh using uh someone's name lah ya because that person had was sick so she uh the nenek like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus lah ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely lah I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area uh my my house was at outram there the old school jalan kukoh lah you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better ah
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot lah and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay uh when when I was in my early twenties kita actually nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah so by right we already moved to yishun way back already tau but then err this err it's a it's a chinese family lah so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house ah so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room lah my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us lah but you can feel lah after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like rimas if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate lah then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you lah the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight lah like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve tau but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her alah she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke you know
passionate ah kira defensive ah
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example lah uh you know like how sometimes people um okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very nya one the nya one ah actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before ah wah sometimes when people in the level of managerial position ah are sometimes very guai lan you know bro dia orang
ya lah but no lah I truly mean it empathise lah kau jangan ketawa now you make me feel bad for laughing
eh but dude I thought all this while memang you were actually very motivated to be a pilot what no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about macam mana kau jadi pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid tau not the interest tau the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
oo sayangnya
eh no lah because new house you say you use mah you don't have to cash contribute what ada how much
eh but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know nasib kentang eh like like first okay lah the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID pula happen like wow
your nasib is so kentang lah dude
nasib kau sangat kentang bro I don't know why I say kentang ah but I feel like it sounds right nasib kau kentang
another ujian
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to salihin ni edwin jadi nyanyuk ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there orang yang dalam asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you siol lah funny sia
siol ah kau
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story lah I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist ah so she's like a old lady lah you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage lah like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just macam smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing what you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you kena arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you kena arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing lah as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see lah
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand mah so aku anytime can just like you know eh
he's a new zealander but sekarang he stay in australia
no it's not about mahal bro even if it's not mahal you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand macam mana if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example lah like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and um I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say oh my house will kena tarik they will say oh I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
the only reason how they can tarik your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house kena tarik not true okay number two uh you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy uh I give you one one scenario lah one of one of this person oh like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount lah so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
because your will still cut mah bulan-bulan for the house ah okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you ah bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years lah depending on the amount that you have to pay err so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that one right they are the people like ah fuck it lah I don't want to pay aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat ah so if they never pay then they cannot travel
but it's not like so long in advance pun you know it's just like a day probably you know ah but the thing is people thought oh cannot that kind of thing
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will tambah balik one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario lah so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay lah let's say you you a newly married couple lah okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans mah
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay habis kan another thing kan macam the second way let's say macam the minimum eh some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the susu pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come lah lawyer letter come lah
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic ah this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see lah they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country lah ah so ah normally they have their debt consolidation plan lah that debt management program lah all these thing lah this is by the by the banks lah of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria lah you know you are eh aku rasa dah habis ah bro okay lah five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done ah okay
hello adik how was your day
itu jer
kita tak celebrate
not tak celebrate like macam tak

aku punya mind aku macam wait are they are they needing orang nak berbual
untuk event or something aku macam yes this is my opportunity
aku berhati-hati interview rupanya
oh okay lah boleh lah
I was thinking macam aku mati-mati yang macam ah aku buat macam
host and event or something macam itu tau
they need speaker for an event macam macam macam lagi oh bukan is not
hey tapi banyak seh
penat sia satu um we need to be mentally prepared satu kau punya pantat kena duduk satu jam satu itu semua lah
unless kalau they give us like you know like a questionnaire untuk kita buat or I mean like not questionnaire atau paper but I think macam they ask us a question that you have to elaborate begitu aku rasa it will be better
macam aku interview orang so macam kita kan seleksi yang better compared to us having a normal conversation and we don't have that case conversation macam kena record
oh ya kau tadi kau
aku macam aku macam
aku macam tengah contemplating a lot
aku macam a lot of thing tengah main lah fikiran otak aku
aku tahu dekat they have like satu ni where you become masyarakat kau tahu macam every
how do I say this like sometimes macam radio station or even macam company oh macam gag
yes they all do those challenges tukar inti itu
okay the kakao macam the face of apa cakap

aku macam I want to find that is fun but kalau ada sikit macam not much commitment lah gitu
macam aku okay aku contemplated a lot of benda firstly ibadat secondly aku nak masuk um
apa begitu macam um voluntary work tapi dekat macam banyak gila voluntary work aku boleh buat
so I think volunteering work yang they work banyak ada yang buat sikit
so aku nak cari yang banyak dan sikit so right now tak takde takde satu pun yang cipta untuk aku
aku pun nak elak nak masuk islamic
macam tu content nanti banyak benda
ya islamic punya group
they ada for that
mm aku ingat macam the name is macam malay cultural group itu tapi dia have different macam cabang-cabang
so macam ideas mm
tapi aku ni dari yang islamic punya community
tapi tu best
macam dia orang masuk um buat amal ramadan
dia orang pack pack barang aku sangat suka tahu cakap tak tahu
okay nah aku macam
ajak a lot of macam fun
tapi macam aku nak banyak masuk tapi macam
macam commitment dia macam kau tahu tak aku punya course macam mana my course is a very
cause course aku is not an easy course
I I definitely say I could've mentally prepared to costly either that I might need to wake up two o'clock to do my journal to do my journalism punya apa topic
mass comm is like easy easy apa easy course untuk masuk
and dia punya content pun macam kau tengok lah if like mass comm
mm film some video dengan editing yang itu kan these are the courses yang macam indirect hiburan and at the same time dia orang macam ah burn the midnight oil lah gitu dia orang cakap
ada orang shooting sampai dua pagi
wah bayangkan
aku rasa aku ada week kalau macam tu aku chillax chillax
silakan farzana mahu tidur lah
tinggal berapa minit ni ya allah empat puluh tiga forty three more minutes
oh aku di intern kan aku rasa
I might go to macam music what's that call music punya
aku nak belajar overseas like aku nak belajar overseas aku nak belajar overseas sebab aku nak rasa ya
being independent ya because kalau kau belajar overseas kau takde you have no excuse to know not how to cook
you must know how to cook to survive because kalau kau cakap home mak aku masak aku tak nak masak
kalau kat luar I have to cook for myself
so at the same time kau belajar untuk berdikari do household rasa macam mak aku rasa
so aku macam nak experience that thing tapi macam kesian pun lah tinggal parents aku
mungkin sebab you have like sister that's why like you don't have sister will be their house buruk-buruk macam mana pun kakak kau akan tetap kat di situ tapi the fact aku ni kakak
aku macam aku rasa macam berat aje tinggalkan mak aku berat jer tinggal family aku
we should though macam
ah overseas ke
actually aku macam nak masuk malaysia tapi macam
daftar sekali korea takde korea uh
cuma feeling kita pergi australia australia kat aku rumah australia
like aku pernah pergi
sedih um
anak comfort like satu macam ni afini dah makan ke belum have you eaten lunch ke belum

like recording conversation I mean like for me personally kalau dua orang macam
lagi lagi iffa kau masukkan iffa dalam conversation ini it's gonna be like

um I think like kena satu ada satu topic untuk berbual
iffa iffa will always have that satu topic untuk ya converse within dua kita orang dua
aku anggap kita macam like more toward like bual-bual kosong
oh yang lelaki tu kan
eh they gave him macam
apa conditional a warning
aku rasa itu macam ada orang ought to see
like it's me kalau benda seorang yang benda sama ya
but macam kalau if you put it in term macam macam kita as a human punya equality
macam diri kita sendiri macam tak kisah orang tu race tu apa what is his race but logically like if you murder sama macam aku seorang you have
macam it's logic for someone to kena gantung ke
macam you murder someone
logically who kena gantung this is like um like the basic macam law that we know lah but
I don't know what derives dia punya court macam kasih conditional warning see the word conditional warning
a'ah so preposterous gila pergi beijing
I saw I go nampak yang punya news nanti
like they tweeted about the story pasal this thing ah

oh my god why wait what it's just let to me specific Tinder atau uh Okcupid
Muzmatch is good there's a lot of um naive girls because you really really go through macam
to to the tee punya macam this one really my mother and my father must know if I go out date with you must bring you home must tell mummy daddy that is okay that's fine if you have the maturity of
amin abeh amin
correct ya this shit will end bro it will end if you really love your boyfriend you will listen to your boyfriend hundred percent if your boyfriend say tak nak kau you won't kau tak akan break up dengan mata air kau just to lepak dengan budak syafiq ni that means you're saying that this fella is much more important than that guy
if your correct if if if shit gets comfortable then you say I just want to hang with my friends then your boyfriend say ah buat apa
because I don't like you atau you don't like me either ways there was something more than a friend you give me no fucking purpose you give me money aku kasi uh I aku kasi kau berbual dengan dia dia tak bayar kau duit
atau dia bagi kau knowledge dia tak bagi kau opportunities in life get the fuck out because I'm your fucking best friend cause to me is like
to have any fucking goals to be busy with other shit than to lepak
would would not get mad with you meh he will get mad what pasal kau dah kau dah pernah berbual dengan dorang and and the way that your and your boyfriend will probably be pissed off because
if syafiq keeps telling you eh lepak ah lepak ah lepak ah when the first meeting problem starts with eh I didn't before sia there's there's gonna be this part of like
I would say because dia very religious kan kau just cakap macam just playfully flirt lah macam
things that make him feel like oh she really wants my attention like eh kau tak berbual dengan aku eh dah lama tak rindu seh or something like that so
it's not haram what I mean okay it is haram because you have the intention but then
I don't like people who lie I don't like people who chase after me I don't like people who like macam step uh apa ni eh uh like you can flirt lah but then like
faham tak it's so many red flags sorry but
I would further macam I would pursue him
faham tak so bila kau dah macam together dengan dia not not if let's say he starts to
like it's either you are a good boy atau you are manipulative
for real huh dia hantar you portrait kimak budak-budak kental pe sia confirm aku cakap dengan kau
you kena cheated also eh we might know he's fucking seeing girls now we don't know
pukiwek three years abeh kena cheated eh siala
you need to ask for details so if he is the type of man that is like macam
kawan aku legit bila aku kecil-kecil kan dia memang betul religious habis the family and very baik so
shy baik and are religious so she she talk to guys from Muzmatch Muzmatch because she's shy to talk to guys in real life and she's also very religious so is very scary lah for you to just macam socialise what
she's the type that don't even wear tudung depan uh pakcik makcik
so legit eh ada orang datang pakai tudung pakai tudung that kind of thing atau macam
eh uh berbual pun baik macam budi bahasa macam lembut so when when she go out with these kind of uh men uh
um pasal everyday they remind themselves ah oh jin selalu ada kalau tempat dua-dua berduaan jin cepat masuk that's fucking true let's be real macam and and that's why to me
in my head is like um if she already said that I want this this this this you you shouldn't complain cause if that's not the type of girl the ratio of the halal and haram is not for you
kau masih nak try try try tapi kau tak up there then how nobody's asking you for a lot of money people asking you for respect towards the girl so this is um
how do I say this ah everytime I give my friend benefit of the doubt I'm always right so macam
eventually will come true whatever I say maybe because whether it was lame maybe that's why sekarang ni dia macam cakap ni cakap tu so if she she say she don't want it then kalau um
he should know better what right that's what I'm saying you should have Muzmatch sia this is not like macam remeh-temeh girl tau it's not like macam
for me to and not because like eh aku no no no I mean my gift alhamdulillah is I can make anybody be fucking comfortable with me so I use that to my advantage
I'm nowhere where I'm at now but I fucking promise one day I'll get up there that is the kind of fucking response I want to get from a man faham tak
you're at his fucking like stage in life where your fucking life is so hard like macam you're going through a lot of uh problems but you have so much to do with it
you are not small boy it's not like eh family aku my family is uh uh poor I mean uh mak bapa aku sakit abeh aku masih kat sekolah
itu aku boleh bagi ah tapi buto kalau kau tengah kerja kau masih nak complain
you know that's why in my in my head is like macam
and like macam I just see through the fucking bullshit I'm not going to lie sometimes when I date date someone also
uh I'm blinded that was the one yang dengan the arab guy that I was with yang macam aku betul-betul sayang but dia macam
like dalam islam pun cakap a good girl is for a good guy if you don't get it maybe you should self-check so cakap dengan dia gitu maybe that's why I don't get the girl is so simple as that
if if you want to say that kalau kau nak macam if you play by insecurity saying that aiya aku tahu lah aku ni buruk aku tahu lah
and then diam lah sial macam do something about it because you're not handicapped there's so many other people that kena burn on the face
and can do nothing about it but did they fucking complain no like macam ya so
you already fucking put your dignity on the fucking floor you step on it already you send a girl a portrait what the fuck sorry aku macam really that's that's weird
it's weird ah macam
how to say ah it's weird it's weird unless kau macam
fan mail then legit kena call fan sia fan I also want to vomit sia huh kau fanatic dia ni when she's just a pretty girl there's no such thing other than that
no you should tell him straight ah eh kimak kau lame pe kau hantar perempuan gini that means before aku kau hantar perempuan apa eh macam tiba-tiba
what the fuck do you do with your free time kau scroll perempuan lawa pastu kau hantar portrait
if you don't like him right trust me if you don't like him I I know that kau perangai kakak-kakak kau punya orang boleh steady punya tapi kau dah kau dah suka
once you date me you die already you die already all my my macam bipolar attitude
all my shout I tell you already what I'm abusive what back then lah you know like I don't give a like bro aku boleh ambil kaca aku boleh campak sia muka kau pun aku boleh pecah kan sia and as a guy also
who the fuck macam owes you a fucking living that you have to change them your mother father lah but not your partner faham tak so
that's why to me is like if you are at this stage to like kau dah mature enough don't lower your standard for a man who doesn't
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be with him I have friends who literally the the guy masuk jail cakap once you are a millionaire then you marry me and he fucking learn eh
that is weird let's see kalau kau betul-betul cut contact let's see who else he send the portrait to bet ah
faham tak cause
ya so that's why aku cakap kau it it all takes time what people especially when you like someone bro
and you've never been he been been uh at his lowest point of uh point in his life have you ever be that kau tengok kau boleh tahan ke tak
you fucking tell me engkau then apa diam ah sial then you want you have a better goal lah like it's simple as that macam
uh that that that that's where I play my game faham tak of like
I pick my battle lah macam okay this guy is enough for me
tell you before leh fuck bro kimak aku punya boyfriend dulu eh perempuan hantar dia macam
eh I saw you around school you look cute aku maki sia buto siapa perempuan ni dia nak tengok-tengok you buat apa dia pasal what
asal kau you can be vulnerable but at the same time you have you have to be like I know I know sleepy
bapa aku sia nama bapa aku sial
then you're much more clearer instead of nevermind just let it be it's okay so that's why I'm telling you kalau
if he if he's not confident he don't pass the confidence punya
wait but then saturday sunday kau buat apa kau keluar dengan dia
okay ya then then just hang with them like macam you want to have fun that is that is that is proper fun bro
stop it like macam if you tell your if tell your oh my god I don't accept that shit like my my partner got tell me before macam
oh I went out with this girl I tak pernah I tak pernah
dia gila-gila kan I tapi I tak pernah uh apa ni
my boyfriend said that he doesn't he just use like he just know that oh this girl got got macam
all due respect like he try to not I don't even know if he does that lah but he said as like macam okay I'm just your friend I'm just your friend but then I simplicate whatever text you send me so he told me that he never liked her at all
you want to fucking go out with her because she got connection because she can give you some sort of like macam um
help with ke apa lan jiao
go ahead with it or whatever kalau macam nak tanya advice about macam kerja in the future ke apa go ahead with it but I'm not
like macam is not more of like macam oh I reciprocate back
so right now you are reciprocating back if your boyfriend were to tell you in the future you ada keluar dengan dia tak you pernah keluar dengan dia tak I was fond of him lah
tapi I tak pernah mata air dengan dia
I can safely say that because I went out with a guy that fucking cheated kena cheated three times still fucking stupid
ah aku pun nak terkencing so how many more
so you telling me I want to belanja you or what
motherfucker aku nak patah balik I need to go back
tak boleh lah you cannot be distracted
oh they cakap that she probably want to get a divorce suddenly so deep ah
okay boleh
wait avengers pasal apa
captain america tak nak
what do I like oo I like comedy oh damn eh err superheroes I won't say specific superheroes like not really like a group of it so aku rasa macam group macam a bit too much gitu
macam you don't even know who to focus on right so if you have to choose then it will be spiderman but only the toby maguire version I don't really like tom holland the character
dia macam a bit awkward
um so dia
so like the way that he act macam
macam half-hearted gitu macam dia nak tak nak gitu
did you just see the the the one yang uh andrew garfield acted ya ya watch all spiderman exactly I think that's why I think it relates my life I don't know
ya aku tengok kat suntec tak tak salah
tak yang movie yang err real life action nya aku tak ingat siapa yang
sedih pe rumah kita kotak-kotak dok kau serious
apa dorang jual dekat supermarket
okay so kalau kita tukar penjara kita macam norway kau rasa boleh jalan
confirm ada banyak order in their own prison cell and and the fact that like in terms of like relapse I think like people will enjoy going prison because they know compared to singapore punya let's say err four room flat
amenities tak ada
so ya I think you really have to see dia punya apa ni culture
eh siala rabak sia
aku boleh pilih ah dia punya
macam tak biasa ah
eh sial lah aku tak belanja sia aku sedih sia cause last year last year aku macam bingit sendiri dengan sendiri tau
err aku tak ada duit kalau aku kan kerja kan eh aku tak kerja aku sekolah
so aku fikir cam simpan dalam apa dia punya basket eh shopping cart dia
benda-benda yang aku nak beli takleh afford
sedih sia
err entah macam
aku rasa aku terbawa-bawa dia punya feeling for sebelas sebelas punya sale
macam it's nothing for me um macam I don't have to worry about eleven eleven because there is black friday
because at the point of time last year black friday aku beli benda so but eleven eleven tak boleh sekali masuk kot aku rasa
kau takleh ni eh macam err collaborate
apa right right right
oh benda dia jalan
anting-anting jer kecil besar
macam stud gitu ah
sembilan puluh lapan siak ah beli kat shopee lagi berbaloi
repurpose ni kan kedai ashley lah mmhmm
eh but then if you take like macam for example if you take like the buttons from a top a blouse for example Chanel buttons how would you know it's actually authentic
belum sia eh kau tahu kan yang one thousand note dah tak boleh pakai
okay bukan tak boleh pakai it's more of like it's obsolete now um so like whatever that it's like remaining out there in the world whoever has the one thousand ya so uh laki aku cakap simpan dulu atau buat investment boleh jual kat carousell berjuta-juta dolar tak aku tipu jer so I don't know
like apa ni
err apa emas
kat cash converter eh cash converter betul lah money max situ ah ah maxi cash

ya simpan duit dulu ah
ya sekarang tak boleh belayar pergi mana-mana kau tahu pasal yang travel bubble
ye ke no lah I think like I mean it's more like commercial travel but um
tak normal like normal nya allergies jer
sakit ah sampai nangis semua
serious dia
laki kau kena block rabak
kirakan kau dah biasa ah
oh dia pun
tapi macam siak jer
dia gardener
damn oh kirakan dia dia kenal tu market
cam dia dia buat survey tak pernah beli
oh pandai juga eh because I have no idea who wants exotic plants I never met anyone
so dia baru start ke
apa nama dia mid-life crisis eh
mm dah lama kan I mean bukan lama sangat lah
macam a few years but
I think it's a thirty thing ah you start to reflect on your life and your parents dia bukan muda lagi
asal kau fikir gitu sia
aku rasa at this point in time
comparing to like our twenties kita tahu kita tak solat lima waktu
and we're in denial of it macam other time in the future I will change but at this point in time like now you flapping I mean that's how I feel like aku cuba ah solat subuh like susah sia nak bangun alarm clock blasting here and left left and right
aku bingit sia selalu adamnya ringtone kan it's like super loud I just take his handphone just like this is so damn annoying dia punya vibration dia just semacam tau
its more mellow so bila aku bangun macam like oh bird you know its much more
compared to bodoh punya handphone
as a wife and and someone because I I came across this Tiktok belajar eh so I came across this Tiktok with post err they were mentioning about like err
my kesalahan right kesalahan aku it's not
on my husband's punya shoulder
my my kesalahan is all just like my fault but his is his but if I do something wrong and he didn't like tegur
so like it's the same thing as wife lah so sebagai isteri kalau aku tak kejut dia untuk solat subuh part tu kesalahan aku lah
so aku macam like aku tahu kan husband aku tak bangun then aku bangun kan dia so asal kan aku kejut kan dia kalau dia solat ke tak solat
okay aku tak tahu but that's how my understanding of it lah
like time kau bertemu janji
kau fikir macam like oh ah aku nak benda ni tapi aku tak nak bilang dia aku nak benda ni
and when you have this assumption and this hope and when the thing doesn't come then kau bingit sendiri
yes I I do acknowledge what you say because that's how my husband is like kalau aku tak tunjuk dia cara-cara
ah kesayangan ke apa dia fikir macam oh aku tak sayang dia so like I have to sometimes show him make effort
well and he does the same to me lah but for me I I rather have him communicate like what he wants or what he doesn't want because I cannot just assume aku aku macam in a way macam a bit
so ya sometimes dia macam hint hint hint then aku macam like what is it that you want and dia dia macam he's the kind of person who says things this way and that way and then macam like cannot make up his mind his decision then aku macam bingit ah
oh kau kau tolong dia ah untuk hantar barang-barang
tapi lepas yang kau cakap dengan dia dia harus berbincang like perasaan semua then apa dia cakap
untuk kau kot the way that you say it
dia mat teruk okay
what's that analogy credit card emotional credit card take it as emotional credit card bila kau run away kan swipe

aku ajar art jer
aku rasa untuk budak lah menarik because like the fact that they know that this err the first three weighted assessment is not as heavy as last one so they can learn at their own pace but some students especially the sec ones
dorang macam like
rasa macam like dorang dah like gerek ah macam like eh tak payah belajar then ni ni jer buat buat quiz jer buat group work jer ah tak payah kita relax jer ah until they reach to the end eh bila macam september sept holidays eh sial lah next week ada peperiksaan sial lah aku belum belajar eh sial lah apa sia tu aku belajar dari january tadi ah so dorang panic ah so if they would have to grasp they if they have grasp the concept
of the this topic that they have learnt in err in from january onwards right then you don't have to worry you ah but kalau dorang macam like ah aku tak kesah aku boleh belajar procrastination and it won't do

no lah I tell him already I I sampai then he never reply
oh oh there's one the nice one the one the dua tingkat right
what's what does simon want to do nak buat apa
then you kena tunggu ah how long was the simulation
ah that's not bad tak tunggu lama ah
I mean even when you're not influenced even if you're not drunk tak mabuk you still cannot predict what that's so funny
cause they already like nak masakkan you then is that it
you makan apa seh kat situ azizi still got
he buncit already meh
ah pasal dia punya percentage for exams is the they um turunkan for exams so they put it at every other uh like assignments quizzes so they increase the percentage there so it's heavier for the assignment than quizzes it used to be like five percent now the quizzes are like ten percent that's whole grade leh babe
so like I have to do properly lah then I taking I taking four modules sia babe like fucking busy I'm so sorry for saying that word but but I'll be so busy tak ada time
ya so I'm telling aqil like I'm gonna be busy I tak ada time for him sometimes like for during the weekdays
he gets it tapi dia pun sedih ah sometimes
ah dia macam kalau I boleh buat you pun boleh buat gitu ah
ya I think gitu ah
lain ah lain I cannot sia like he that time he also he only one module lah then I got four modules
cause the other day he was asking me eh err do you have lobang for like then it's like aiya syrinah boleh cari sendiri ah but like you know the previous place I worked at the dyslexia association of singapore they they paying quite high oh now lah
ya it's macam learning centre punya timing ah but it's lepak ah the job is it's damn lepak
no babe it will like strain your body sia then you want to have baby camne nak have a baby if you're gonna be tired all the time
then you can just hantar him lah
tinggal mana seh babe
that's so freaking far from dari bishan pergi choa chu eh pergi his ah camp is kat mana
like you beg her that's what I would do I would pujuk her I'll cium her kaki sia to kasi the bilik
it's like girl I'll get you an iphone and ipad anything you want just let me have the room five days a week you just live in the hall for five days a week a few nights a week and then on the weekends you can have it wah susah sia tak ada rumah sendiri I swear it's damn hard
wah then must tahan like this for satu tahun
no wonder simon kata want to get his own car the other day
it's not cheap sia babe tu hari I tolong top up kan aqil punya minyak cause he was driving me around so I offered to bayar for the minyak ah I only kasi fifty dollars and it's like
what the hell it's so mahal sia their minyak the fuel consumptions is like shit
it's mahal as shit man I swear it's like honestly bike
like I I tengok also if like
and it's all the way at the lim chu kang there sia what bus will pergi sana
tak payah lah oh my god you know what I think right it's a good thing that you're not working right now because you can like hantar simon
sleep in or you know not the one to trouble you but kesian sia he he like I also will think like
but it's only like um august september october november lima lima bulan jer tinggal then after that you guys can like like breathe a little right
the doa the berkat the berkat from the family like you know like another I don't know lah to me doesn't matter as long as got I don't need my makciknya berkat it's okay god sees me and god loves me so that's fine
I feel like as long as ya I feel like if you're pregnant tak yah sudah it's like forgo the whole idea but since you're not pregnant you know planning planning
right so are they agreeable to return you the duit after kalau in december tak boleh hold a wedding are they going to return the money
but that like dengki sia
oh masih tu ah
I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them macam everything tau you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to uh and then you also include like you you um macam if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how sia you nak macam it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects lah like you still going to lose money sia
and at this time leh macam
macam like you lost thousands of money eh just because like orh the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
it's not even your fault sia it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been uh how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the majlis are over like you get duit salam you know
I told aqil I had no expectations like kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin ah but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time ah cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course tapi I tak nak macam okay I need to find a man yang I boleh kahwin no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will uh fall into place lah like if if we kahwin then kahwin like but ultimately I feel like uh it's important that aqil and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting ah of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so pelan-pelan ah
because we are exclusive kita tak cakap we we kita tak berbual dengan orang lain like we love each other like we see a future in each other tapi um
so he say ah like let's celebrate or officiate um hujung tahun
tapi kan babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I tak biasa like him looking at my phone
he must see me siapa text he must see me siapa call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I nak tengok your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all ugh in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
oh right so anyway like in december he kata like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I macam oh then he cakap ah actually dia dah start saving like he's very uh thrifty like
like a lot of things happen because of him like macam me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
then I was really sad cause during my birthday dorang tak wish I um
I know like I know he's an adult like I know dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
so like I was so sure of hassan ah I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him oh my god okay I nak bilang you something ah yesterday yesterday semalam I told aqil this I say I cakap dengan aqil um
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things um tertulis ah lah like is everything tertulis what like

that's like trying to be macam they are trying to
lepas tu um dah kahwin after a few after a few years dah penat like pretend to be someone that you're not
cakap melayu lah okay so itu saja tentang hassan
ah tentang hassan dan aqil
oh I still macam sedih seh you and simon tak pergi honeymoon
the thing yang I akan look forward to right
thai pancake sedap dok thai pancake
ya but krabi punya water activities mm lame juga ah
I nak ikut I nak ikut mak dan ayah
tak boleh itu honeymoon
okay abeh atas I tell my parents I go with you then over there we separate
then kat sana kita separate
kalau pergi krabi
ah ah kita I tell
I tell my parents that I go dengan you then kat kat sana then I separate lah dengan aqil lah
no tapi nak buat like you can do your own things boleh buat benda sendiri boleh
lepak jer water activities makan lepak
you don't like macam buat activity
tapi macam sightseeing pergi like hiking pergi like um visit temples and shit
I'm okay to like shop like maybe half a day or like two hours or three hours kalau the whole day nak pergi shopping I boring seh like bosan gila
macam restless as err especially if like I tak cause I don't really like shop much
if I don't have anything that I like then boring gila seh
I feel like kita should go
buat anak dekat bali
uh kalau kita empat pergi bali aqil dengan I kita pergi uh ee kita get high
kita get high on shrooms kita get high on mushrooms
orh yesterday um we saw aqil ah class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like he was with his girlfriend oh my god the girlfriend cantik gila sia I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like uh ya melayu but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like macam like I say hi ah but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then aqil was like are you like shy then I was like no I just I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
because right babe when we duduk in the car aqil need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
I am not complaining ah cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I tak complain lah pasal I pun nak aircon the kereta dia anyway so up to you lah you nak on aircon I okay jer you nak waste nak waste gas
but I think one thing that I need to like um get used to is dia punya cemburu
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person dia cakap dia tak jealous tapi
bila I cakap pasal like my guy friends or like shah shah sia shah is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then macam oh maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I tak jealous pasal like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
like to me it's like uh old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that one I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like kalau you nak dengan dorang you dah lama dah dengan dorang
so like the fact that you and dorang tak together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything lah between you
I punya timer five three two eight
orh pasal aqil tak practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard ah to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like oof damn cause he dulu tak pernah puasa then he say for the last two years he's been puasa full lah
so macam
especially practising muslim so macam like ah but macam I have friends who like drink but then they go solat jumaat
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like dia dia punya
pendirian ah like dia rasa like it's okay for him to do it because dia tak practise he's not a practising muslim tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia practise practise religion then itu salah so like I don't wanna ya so like macam oh okay like that's your view too
gasak kau lah nak buat apa you you dah besar you tahu apa salah apa betul apa so I tak kesah ah dia nak buat apa
not my responsible to tegur you because you dah tahu all this you dah tahu and like siapa I nak tegur you know
so I think part yang dia like in terms of I'm just scared macam my parents ada high expectations on aqil like they
they nak ni nak tu then they will they will I scared they feel like aqil is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair lah pasal they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I yang nak kahwin pe
I think my my parents punya fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life lah like once kita dah
meninggal like you know that kind of thing
macam tak sincere jer
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our macam we will start planning lah like properly macam
apply for house then like um because aqil just started working so his is tak banyak
I feel like I feel like aqil is very very reasonable dan dia punya like
dia tak macam kata dia kata dia tau dia like dia dia will dengar cakap orang then after that he will like process and then he would
macam be with
like as a partner dia
dia faham like the what is understanding in malay babe

I I wouldn't say informal it's it's formal enough to know err where you stand or what you want to get to know you as as as a candidate but at the same time it's not like stressful you you know how interview can be can become like macam like siala I want go interview but I scared sia yes like you know you get so intimidated by the interviewer
we choose it in a in a sense where this pandemic is gonna be for quite some time so even if you find a replacement job you must you be able to like the job if not you gonna drag your feet to work you know and you also have to think strategically in a way where macam um aku kerja sini kalau aku tak suka aku nak nak berhenti kerja lain then bila aku cari kerja lain I'm fighting with a lot more competition then after that macam
very much so yes okay lah no look my training ground is actually quite far tapi aku aku fikir panjang kan dia cakap five year plan kan aku fikir five plan dia dekat dengan rumah aku saya pun okay

mm damn fikir-fikir balik aku rasa aku pun struggle a lot lah but those issues was only faced during in like year three ah so bu
I had a lot of assignments dengan to complete and it was really nerve wrecking for my internship cause it was at a hospital lah
tapi in all I guess my poly life was quite fun and interestin
mm aku tak tahu ah macam mana nak bagi kau tips but because like it really depends on your course since I was in biomed kan more of my assignment was more into like theory based punya</malay
tengok kalau aku nak bagi kau tips pun aku rasa tak manfaat kot cause kau pernah bilang aku that your course is design righ
err I'm currently working full time at P&G as lab analyst dekat</malay
it's a microbiology lab ah so called kau akan buat testing to like you know facial products and shit like that penat sia kerja I mean like there's there was a lockdown right like during the COVID perio
mm aku actually actually planning untuk sambung sekolah cause aku rasa righ
oh aku tak tahu that your sister was in because I'm planning to go to juga um as a part time student in biomedical engineering cours
aku rasa part time student is the best for me right no
mm pelik kau punya cousin boleh pecahkan kau punya specs sia
mm maybe lah if I got time err in the future and maybe I have enough money aku temankan kau buat specs lah cause I feel like I also need specs my degree also keep increasin
mm we can't really go outside unless they are for like necessities and stuff like that ya rindu seh keluar dengan kawan semua especially karaok
mm like I say limited places sebab like some places pukul sepuluh dah tutup seh so macam</malay
ya that sounds like a good plan tapi like as I said mm semua orang pun busy aku pun busy juga since I'm looking full tim
um ahead kau nak pergi staycation err
kau ada ke hotel that you find interesting at the moment like any kind of promotion that you see or stuff like tha
mm actually that place one pun bagus juga ah I went there for my friend's birthday bash that was like pre period like before circuit perio
kalau ada room service pun baik juga</malay
mm talking about shangri la I came across the article dekat apa tu the smart local if I'm not wrong pasal the shangri la
I don't know lah it's entirely up to you I don't know I also don't know when the promo ends also I aku rasa it's end of this septembe
tak salah aku ah
aku dengar-dengar kau punya kawan pun kerja dekat shangri la how was the place like I know my friend work there before but has
he said the food there nice lah but tak halal lah
mm ya maybe we should ah but we really have to plan well I guess I mean kalau tak boleh staycation pun I guess we can do other activities cause like there's a lot of dessert places and also like food places we can visit I have a list of it lah maybe I ca
ya I remember pemalas malas nak jalan oh I remember that cafe I think it's like hot chicks or somethin
aku recommend kau pergi I mean we we can go to cat cafe dekat rail mal
very cute kau boleh main dengan kucing while you like have your dessert or some stuff mm cause I saw this on my friend's instagram and it looks really cute and the price is also not so bad lah it's affordable and other than tha
the mind cafe is just like macam apa ni you go there and then you order some drinks and you can play games like board games and stuff like tha
seems interesting but that malay cafe that you're talking about sounds really shady asal pergi sana aku pun tak tahu
uh uh mm maybe can ajak ayu also ah bu
pelik it's weird ah I scared I'm awkward with her I mean you you're closer with her I guess I don't kno
I mean ya lah aku tahu during secondary school I was a nerd lah cause I was really focusing on like you know finishing my O's going poly and shit s
I mean I had a I I mean I talk to guys during that period but I don't think dating was an option cause I mean you look at our school lah lelaki semua pecah sia
let's be honest can't they're I mean they are not pecah but they're not like you know nice people so I rather not be attached to the
I will do my part also I guess you don't really need to show everything online lah for me ah cause aku rasa kalau if show everything online nanti kalau kau orang break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
I don't know I just don't like sharing it's weird I I don't know how you all do it like kau orang just post pictures of each other and stuff like that I'll I'll feel weird doing that I guess it's just not me ah
a few days you can come to work kan macam tak fair seh kau tak akan earn tak akan apa ni hold duit yang cukup untuk sekolah and for your own like needs sebab aku tengok kau design kau selalu macam</malay
kena pakai printers semua untuk print kau punya project so tu semua pakai duit sia
huh someone got fired who sia siapa seh what happen I'm curiou

apa eh orang kata be mor
flexible I guess like if she's really busy baking for the shit right I mean baking for like you know the breads and stuff like that then like at least her as a manager she can handle the cashier what tak salah pe asal dia macam gini sia tak faham seh
on with that kind of salary plus um aku ada bilang kau ke tak yang aku punya matair sekarang tengah kerja temperature taking righ
dia punya his pay also got cut like previously it was twelve dollars right but now they cut it to eight fift

in short overall everything will work out fine anyways aku dengar after your interview kau keluar dengan kawan kau kan pergi mana jer merayap jer kerja</malay
like he pay for your stuff and he didn't do anything creep like that ustaz who is a creeper don't know why you go out with those kind of guys also those disgustin
plus sixteen ex is quite a lot so what does that mean he he matair for like two months habis tu break then another girlfriend is it sixteen banyak sia
just focus focus on yourself lah lagipun kau lagi muda there are other things for you to worry about like your school and your career there's a lot of things in front of you you have to achieve before you know finding the right on

kita uh kita bermula berbual dalam bahasa melayu
kita just
kita just
kita just bermula dengan apa-apa yang kita boleh uh berbahas
though aku tak tahu lah aku punya melayu just rabak
aku punya bahasa melayu boleh berbual but tetapi
ini aku tak tahu kalau saya berbual melayu
tapi gitu lah
begitu lah
kamu kamu belajar um
anda anda anda belajar err bahasa melayu
eh kita berbual macam bahasa pasar aku rasa pasal aku aku mencuba
berbual dalam bahasa pasar kadang-kadang perkataan perkataan inggeris akan termasuk dalam jadi saya and
ah perkataan inggeris akan termasuk dalam
memusnahkan memusnahkan recording ini
apa eh awak lah bilang saya
oh rakaman macam saya
macam mana saya boleh ingat macam mana hendak mana saya boleh macam mana saya boleh terlupa benda macam gini senang senang boleh terlupa tak bagus ini
ya allah susahnya ini sejak saya
sudah habis err
peperiksaan melayu A levels saya tidak gunakan
yang formal
ah dia akan termasuk tanpa pemikiran
lebih baik uh
saya boleh I can control okay I can control better when I speak formal malay like so that no
okay berbalik dengan berbual dalam bahasa melayu sekarang
kerana saya takut err bahasa melayu kita tak cukup
sekarang kita hampir nak dekat uh satu jam saya tak tahu kalau kita nak extend satu dua minit just berbual bahasa melayu
uh kau did you realise just now that I just said the word just
okay kita sudah hampir sudah sampai lepas satu jam
jadi kita try
naik basikal I see the cuaca today like hot only
I need to wear face masks right now sekarang dengan COVID nineteen ni semua
oh the kain yang macam instructor when they do instructors when they do camp they wear that buff mask right that kind that oh ya okay okay
tadi that time you told me before lah apa you cakap you you cycling abeh ada benda go into your mouth is it
susah nak nak bernafas lah ni
lalat as in ah as in lalat as in housefly
but a lalat the black flying buzzing thing
you swallowed you went to swallow ah the housefly sedap tak
so you were cakap orang cakap apa ni perfectly fine ah after you accidentally swallowed a housefly
the oh ya true true ada tempat yang
err ya I mean ada tempat
entah mana lah suka they they love to makan all these maggots spiders all these weird weird apa binatang ni semua
no no I I don't I don't want to eat all these any weird animals eh you said you you ride bicycle eh datang sini
and you tengah ambil your motorbike licence right are you oh yes
kat mana where you take where you taking ah
and kalau you naik motorbike if I'm not wrong lah if I'm not wrong err if you work under foodpanda dia punya gaji lebih kan sepuluh dollar per hour I think
tapi I think I got some friends who are under
who are under foodpanda dia orang I ada tanya lah I ask them eh how much gaji bagus tak if you work with foodpanda as part time and stuff and they say it it's not bad lah actually like I think they have the for foodpanda if I'm not wrong they have the
hourly rate and then if within that one hour you boleh hantar banyak makanan they call it docket if I'm not wrong
so if you can hantar more food means you earn more dockets and there's ada macam bonus lah kasih dia orang happy sikit kasih the riders happy sikit
macam competing lah
oh okay tapi if I'm not around kan ah kadang-kadang if the customer happy you bawa
their their makanan cepat-cepat then they will boleh kasih you tip eh
tapi tengok lah tapi ada orang kasih ke tak
okay okay okay tapi ah what's the
what's the paling banyak ah orang kasih your tip
macam paling banyak tip one time they give you one big tip ada tak
one customer kasih give you ah ten dollar tip
wah very good ah but oh ya your bicycle I see I like so terkejut no I follow my friends semua nak beli basikal I thought lah I ingat one bicycle maybe
sixty dollars ke hundred dollars ke but
and we can you imagine you tengah hantar makanan orang tengah tunggu at the house waiting where is my food alamak then find out the the rider bicycle pancit or the wheel
ah pecah ke apa then like quite wasted lah if you buy a cheap very cheap kind of bicycle
oh ya lah dia punya drivers kalau nampak orang bicycle they will try to try to apa tu drive very near to the bicycle ya lah I mean I know that you all want to rush for more orders means more money but then sometimes terlupa that eh you guys are on the road
and there are buses ada apa tu lorry ada motorcycles semua so next time just be more careful lah tengok lah before you pusing you tengok apa apa tu blind spot check back check back eh check back whether there any vehicles around you ah
okay okay then you tadi morning you told me you were taking your motorbike practical also right kat where again kat mana the ubi ubi eunos there right is it
ah so you macam tahu lah apa dia punya dangers and stuff
so next time when you dah dapat license your motorbike licence ke car license or lorry license so next time you know especially when you see eh got one cyclist coming or eh got one cyclists behind me you know lah to be more careful
eh wait wait that means you on which practical five eh lima
ah okay okay okay before oh ya prac five yang you have to do everything in the circuit then kalau pass prac six then only can go out at the road
uh okay tapi one thing about ubi eh cause I took my license there at ubi also
that dulu lah dulu lah when I when I took my license apa tu ubi ah very crowded so you just be very careful lah kalau especially when you first time keluar naik road
because I know some of my kawan they took the license motorbike licence kat
the one yang kat the one yang kat mana woodlands woodlands ya I know they told me that the area there sunyi ah quiet like not as many vehicles not as crowded macam kat ubi so I think for them was macam lagi senang to pass the test lah test
you naik basikal to ubi
oh you tak ambil public transport
orh okay okay okay then for you kalau dari hougang want to cycle to woodlands itu dah penat bro
by the time you want to start your lesson at woodlands you already penat you cannot really ride the motorbike motorbike ride you I think I don't know whether motorbike would go then later you kena scolding from all instructors
tapi I think one practical how much is it now
dua puluh eh dua puluh lebih
oh yes yes as you I think as you naik naik uh as you progress the cost of course lah dah lagi more mahal
kalau you go out on the road I think one instructor the ratio one instructor is to five
six or five riders I think that that's lagi more mahal lah as you go along this
but when do you think you will get your license though boleh beli motorbike boleh naik motorbike no need to ride your bicycle
lagi that day yang kat ah news north west line the major ah blackout alamak itu dia orang during bila peak period and then the red line the green line dengan dia punya yellow line sekali breakdown
ya but ah apa tu when you when you dah pass eh which I hope you do pass soon which motorbike you looking for yamaha suzuki
one five zero itu kan the tuning training centre punya motorbike eh tak
oh you can get cause I know my friends yang sekarang tengah pakai they say it's err fuel efficient dapat jimat duit sikit
atau kalau you banyak duit sangat kan you boleh beli those err more expensive motorbike yang macam triumph
triumph or ah the one I paling suka when I see people riding on the motorbike uh royal enfield
oh but you don't want to buy a first hand punya motorbike eh
wah and then kalau you tak ada here for six months then who going to use your bike cause you need to always someone needs to start start your motorbike right you cannot leave it err sleeping for too long period
but I mean the transport transports sekarang tak boleh reliable sangat lah sekarang
tapi I would say that the transport has he has been getting better lah dulu I think a few years back three or four years back ada this one period of time macam every week confirm plus chop ada breakdown every week confirm ada
breakdown lah ada yang
the travelling time was too long ada jer problem kadang-kadang but I would say now is much better lah they're doing a much better job but but having said that masih boleh improve that they can still improve so that's my take
the best surprise eh yang I paling dapat uh
ini many years ago lah eh many many years ago when a for my twenty first birthday selamat hari jadi eh my twenty first birthday ah my kawan-kawan kaki bola my soccer mates want to throw me a birthday
ya so I remember that time masih masih bulan ramadan that time when we were still fasting and then my birthday fell within that month lah
then err they chose this place namanya is called mark's place the one at eunos they wanted to belanja me dinner then okay I was like okay sure ah then I went down
they book the table for seven so senang lah bila time buka we all boleh makan together right
so I came down I was so excited lah kirakan eh I went there at about pukul berapa eh I went six thirty so I sat there and I was the first to come I was the first to arrive so okay I duduk I duduk there at the table
then I duduk I tunggu tunggu tunggu for my friends nobody turn up tak ada orang datang
so I just wait and wait and wait and then the next thing I know ada because the place where I tengah duduk uh is facing the road
so I saw this one kereta just drive past tapi nampak ni kereta macam pernah nampak jer this kereta then I noticed dia punya driver was my one of my teammates so I was like okay okay maybe they already arrived so I'll just continue sitting down so
oh by the way kita tak makan kat sini I tengok them they tengok me and then I still remember other tables
they went to put a blindfold around me and then I was like terkejut sikit lah eh asal tiba-tiba want to blindfold me right so they blindfold me and then they they put me in the car
then err so they blindfolded me so when I masuk the kereta I didn't know who is inside I don't know what was inside the car so you just tell me diam-diam and then just sit in the car they will drive me to a unknown location lah location yang I sendiri tak tahu so
but then I think the duration on the car trip was about twenty minutes I could hear like they went to make some pit stops because I can hear the the dia punya pintu
I can hear the pintu buka but when the pintu buka also I I cannot remove my blindfold okay then after that I
I felt like the car dah park and then my kawan-kawan say okay now you can uh get off the car so of course ada orang pimpin my tangan cause I already blindfolded I cannot just walk right I might fall into longkang or something
ah okay then I just ikut I just pimpin my friend tangan they brought me to a unknown location ah next thing I know when I open my blindfold I was at marina barrage heated gang marina barrage
kita kat marina barrage
ya oh if I remember correctly tak salah there were about
seven to eight more of my soccer teammates who were there and they they were sweet they letak uh picnic mat they letak uh fairy lights and they prepared some makanan like pizza which was good because I was hungry by then and
just to remind everyone that we were err tengah puasa time tengah puasa I was very hungry and then they prepared some food and drinks ada bawa uh game cards so that we could play and then we played some music and nice lah like people celebrate your twenty first birthday
yang paling best uh lepas kita dah makan dah sing song uh perut dah kenyang and then err one of them pass me a birthday present
and nasib is the birthday present that I have been wanting for quite some time it was a kasut nike like this specific kasut yang
was quite mahal lah actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this kasut that I think was about dua ratus lebih this pair of nike shoes
and honestly when if I were to buy a present for somebody I will tanya the person first like oh apa yang you nak you want a teddy bear ke you want
you want if motorbike cannot lah I not that kaya so I cannot buy for you a motorbike but if you want a storybook or a backpack boleh lah if you your birthday present what do you want
ya at that point in time bila aku dalam kereta macam eh
takkan they want to kidnap me takkan they want to hantar me to johor bahru or put me in a abandoned house or something ada lah there was a period of time I was like asal kereta ni macam suddenly so quiet eh like where is everybody in the car or suddenly they abandoned the car then I'm sitting there alone in the car not knowing what's happening
so but I trusted them I mean they are my apa ke tu ah kawan-kawan kaki bola so that ended well and I think the thing about a presents eh
because sometimes I don't want to belikan orang tu a present that they might not want or atau present like they won't use so either I will ask them personally like oh okay what do you want for your birthday lah or it's either I buy for them uh
vouchers like it can be macam adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vouchers can be nike vouchers ah pergilah kau apa kau nak beli
I know kalau kalau perempuan dia orang selalu cakap lagi senang pasal can buy err gift card from sephora especially like sephora or you can buy from victoria secrets usually lah girls I think lagi senang to to buy presents for compared to a guy
took my suggestions I I wouldn't even call it suggestions actually I said that I tak suka kalau macam
uh big uh birthday bash macam ada orang kan they especially kalau
twenty one birthday they will have their macam nak glamour glamour have it at the chalet where they where they will invite macam kawan dia nenek dia cousin dia abeh nanti banyak sangat orang like I tak suka that kind of stuff lah
kawan-kawan rapat lah so is good thing that they didn't throw a big uh big surprise at a chalet or hotel so I do you like kalau anybody do like a big grand gesture like that
and also kalau macam banyak sangat orang especially kalau invite banyak sangat orang abeh orang yang you tak kenal atau orang yang that you barely talk to so you macam tak nak awkward lah then kalau banyak sangat orang also later you have to
you have to split your time with err different people and then I mean you cannot cut yourself into half right so you will have to speak with this group of people for like five ten minutes and then you kena go to entertain another group then you you'll be busy just entertain people actually
instead of having macam a very good time and macam shiok sendiri
and I so I feel like kalau like you want to have a this macam grand gestures right you need to kena fikir where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until macam sakit kepala lah you have to think
about venue and then you have to book in advance kalau you want to do like
tempat mahal-mahal macam hotel you have to book maybe a few months in advance
maybe and aside from venue also you kena book
ah makanan I mean come on I mean when you invite people you don't want them to come there and then there's like nothing to eat anyway we're all singaporeans right so we we love our food so we need think about venue nak kena fikir pasal uh makanan
and then you have to send out invitation then you have to you if you want to have some entertainment then you have to fikir oh what entertainment do you want I mean kalau you have someone else who is doing the planning and stuff okay lah then you can like lepak don't have to
if you gonna dapat orang birthday planner or something like that then you kena bayar this birthday planner pakai duit lagi
oh ya I mean like quite true eh tadi you cakap pasal if your birthday on macam twenty fifth december ke or macam your birthday is on err
thirty first december where's the peak period macam banyak orang confirm nak nak book err tempat macam want to book the hotels dekat dekat dengan the floating platform so they can probably see like the fireworks and stuff
so that one will be even harder lah I would say or even if your birthday falls uh during national day parade I'm pretty sure it will be quite difficult quite difficult and susah to dapat all this uh bookings and stuff
and also kalau macam some people macam tak nak celebrate dia punya birthday kat singapore nak pergi overseas ke apa nak pergi batam
or let's say somewhere even further like you want to go poland or something to go and celebrate your birthday itu lagi mahal kau nak kena beli apa tu plane tickets semua tapi sekarang bila time macam gini
nobody saw it coming macam time COVID you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more gerek lah if you can celebrate your birthday in bali or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more gerek sia
like I think for me kalau if I can choose eh where I want to spend my birthday I want to go where's that tempat banyak sheeps ah new zealand
like honestly if I can if I can choose a place to celebrate my birthday or to choose a tempat for me to go holiday that would definitely been using you can go to the countryside boleh apa tu feed the animals you can play with the animals I mean come on man in singapore
err kambing so at least when you go places like new zealand especially dia punya countryside you get to see all this kind of animals and you get to do a lot of uh
natural activities like apa tu yang kat river the water rafting you can go hiking you can see
uh nice nice mountains and of course dia punya cuaca also lain lain from singapore singapore is always hot either hot or wet so at least there in new zealand if you can go during the winter times dapat juga some snow you pernah pergi new zealand eh
tapi kalau uh japan japan nak cari
halal food also was quite difficult I remember that time when I went with my family we went to go japan or we wanted to look for halal food punya lah susah and
it was not readily available so you have to do your macam homework lah before you go you must probably want to bookmark the places where you want to makan halal food
because it's not like singapore where your halal food boleh dapat at food court you can dapat your halal food at a hawker centres which are all semua dekat dekat boleh jalan so there the
their are halal food ah is different different locations and you have to go and find it in orang jepun they don't really speak english so kalau nak berbual you probably have to use ah the app google translate to help you out
oh the place I went mana eh I went to their
uh tokyo so tokyo was tokyo honestly dia macam singapore lah macam banyak sangat orang it's very crowded it's a very urbanized so if there's other parts of jepun that I would like to visit err I will go further up north
err pergi hokkaido I think hokkaido also lagi tempat dia will be more sejuk and I think the food will be even nicer as well
have to been to pernah pergi tak hokkaido
so I think kalau if you don't want to go jepun another place that I pernah pergi also err south korea like at least south korea you know lah people there dia punya complexion semua cantik-cantik
semua the people there their are complexion all putih-putih and then I think probably I know why now because when I went there their food
is always some kind of err herbal food dia punya makanan is very different from singapore like our singapore diet kita banyak lemak-lemak kita banyak pakai err makanan yang very oily but there in korea their food
and they always like to eat their favorite kimchi so I think their diet really helps them out to for them to look even more kacak and cantik lah actually
oh ya because their their location have err what you call that four seasons but for us in singapore it's just hot all year round because we are located dekat equator
so I mean I'm pretty sure uh countries yang ada four seasons of course their complexion would be even better I mean if you go to ah further up north
places macam err sweden ke or you go to norway or finland if you tengok their completion putih macam letak bedak kind of putih
and err one thing kalau want to talk about uh going on vacation and stuff I think one err important aspect about going to vacation is to naik kapal terbang like honestly I miss
I miss taking all this kapal terbang just to duduk inside the plane and then below you look out the window you can see the clouds you among the clouds and that
in a roller coaster when the plane dah nak takeoff atau the plane about to land I think that's why now COVID err introduce the
dining in the parked aeroplane like macam banyak orang nak pergi tapi dia punya pricing I would say to me is a bit expensive like you are eating
I think the cheapest one for the economy class is two hundred two hundred dollar plus just to be eating in a parked plane and sitting in the tempat economy
so maybe I will decide nak tengok nak pergi ke tak but probably not maybe you just want to sit the aeroplane and that's probably the closest thing lah that you can get to travelling during this
err COVID situation will you go for this err parked err makan
and also I think the the tickets for the business class and first class if I'm not wrong lah is about six hundred plus if I'm not wrong and honestly kalau nak fikir pasal six hundred plus I think that six hundred plus I can use
for better purposes six hundred plus I can use it for a staycation kat sentosa ke or I can use that money for
I can use that for better purpose as an anyway since we are coming to december dah nak dekat
I would wait for the hundred dollars tourism voucher lah to use it and spend and help to revive the economy because I mean since orang kat luar cannot come in so obviously we are the ones who have to
next week kau start ni kan apa ah volunteer eh
kat mana ni kau pergi where is it
orientation online macam mana what like what a lot of you meet macam gitu
ya lah this kind of volunteering betul betul betul betul betul I'm sure you can find something that you can do best you know macam that will fit you punya
chinese new year I think uh end jan apa
selalunya selalunya kan end jan
entah copywriting ya exactly maybe they should they will definitely make you guys to macam go on the ground isn't it macam distribute stuff no ah kau tak penat ke but they might ask you to do that no like be on the ground
penat ke apa engkau ke you know like you got to
how the hell would I know abeh macam you have to go on the ground like what if they ask you to like okay you go to the homes and distribute stuff
ya they volunteer because I'm I'm one of the uh volunteers right so aku my my my volunteering with them is really fostering ah so I'm a rather than you know uh
it's a shelter the dogs are in kan kan is a shelter it's over at west we're actually quite close to what tengah ya tengah ya we are very close it's it's just next to choa chu kang ya like we're very close to so they have people they have volunteers at the shelter itself so that means the volunteers must go to the shelter uh that involves dog walking
err cleaning really literally like cleaning the you know the poo poo ya ya and then uh there are volunteers such as ambassadors such as what I mean like macam they have events they have events like okay then there is an event here at this uh uh at this uh area at one raffles place so they have like a booth or two booths you know and then they need somebody to to to to to man the merchandise table and another one is to macam
uh macam orang lalu-lalang kan then you macam talk about the awareness gitu lah which I wouldn't mind doing actually uh tapi sekarang uh we don't get enough as a volunteer I don't get the notifications anymore because I think they stopped that lah for being like you said lah because of the COVID ya so they're not so you know they can't go out in the open anymore for now
dog walker boleh lah cuma only you and the dogs tapi macam public all this awareness sort of stuff uh no not so much now I think later they will probably do it I used to get uh emails pasal unit unit ambassadors and all that tapi now no more
ambassadors macam you you you macam you at the booth and you wear punya t-shirt uh you're next to the merchandise punya table sell the merchandise and then of course the donations punya uh apa ni uh tin tu kan and then then you talk to people about okay this is what we do uh this is what we do as an and these are the cases macam gitu awareness of uh what does and how they can help oh they also have social uh pre-corporate social responsibility punya programs companies punya tu
so then you can do that uh they can say oh we need we need volunteers for to do the ambassador part and all that ya so of course they have different volunteer ada volunteer macam photography
macam to be a volunteer photographer to take pictures of their animals for their adoption drive for their website ya you know all the gambar-gambar for the calendars so regular they need uh you know volunteers photography web design web designer of course fosterers a lot lah I'm one of them
which I'm fostering for kucing I volunteer to be a foster for critical care
fosterer for puppies macam gitu so when they have cases then they contact you say okay wati we have this then
exactly kesian kan
you know lah kan international kan kan nama international punya brand kan so orang pun ada lah you know macam kasih donation gitu ada lah I think I guess they do have you know uh
uh but at the end of the day they still run on donations only which is quite sad uh kita punya G O V takde kasih apa-apa
dia orang eh ini binatang-binatang kita orang tau daripada negeri ini mesti lah jaga sikit
ah that is the masalahnya tu
oh I think must there has to be some uh apa ni uh macam caretaking of all or all inhabitants but of course we're certainly the portion is not lah macam of course the priority is to be citizens in a way as in proportionate you know but
areas not all these wooded areas you know these these areas bukit batok lah banyak banyak macam jungle jungle apa they are clearing all the forests and the stray dogs are coming out you don't know bukit batok has a lot of stray dogs ya and they are the stray dogs are coming out from the jungle areas and where are they going to go they are being pushed out right from other developments where are they going to go then they are going into the uh estates like now so then of course who is going to get panicky residents residents are going to complain uh authorities come in take the dogs and cull them which is very inhumane so ideally what you should happen is if you are going to develop the land which I know you probably should have to but then there has to be contingency plan where you going to drive the animals out  you know is like I feel it is not thought through out you know okay we're going to develop the land we're going to end up pushing the animals that are in there they are going to end up going to hello resident areas so why don't we do something about that two pronged approach
tengah mm mm mm
of course they know they know they see it we they see it all the time and dogs are coming out punggol pasir ris choa chu kang but there also but also yes the wild boar of course is in the news and everything how can they not know but are they doing anything no they are not the second part is the second part is they are not this is why we are frustrated we go like why don't you do something help we are not telling you to do it one hundred percent because we are completely we understand that they are completely incompetent but takde collaboration kau faham tak takde supportive effort at all macam okay kau okay kita sekarang kita punya and animal welfare groups okay why don't we support you into doing this you know what I mean kita nak buat macam gitu macam okay kita dia orang because dia orang uh yang boleh ambil I mean they are the ones with the expertise the heart the passion all that but they cannot be run they they cannot do all because they have no space and duit takde duit kan so siapa yang ada duit ni yang itu kan government kan so at least macam okay kita tolong collaborate lah you know uh okay uh kita buat ni then you all can uh kita boleh kasih kau orang support sikit-sikit untuk blah blah blah you know this is exactly what should happen but it's not happening so apa yang buat sekarang is bila binatang ni keluar yang gahmen gahmen ni semua angkat tangkap bunuh it's like it's an inhumane approach you know what I mean ya itu yang kita boring
ya lah tapi not to this extent not to this extent look at tengah now tengah baru tengah is now being developed which means they are they are accelerating and intensifying the development so now the animals are getting pushed out last time the animals are not getting pushed out so much because tengah is still around correct lim chu kang sekarang semua nak development punggol mana ada punggol dulu dulu mana ada waterway punggol sekarang dah ada punggol apa all the dogs from punggol are coming out you can you can literally walk on punggol street with the traffic light and there's like a pack of stray dogs dulu mana ada because punggol was not developed that's why the the problem is highlighting is being highlighted now because wah dogs are coming out what how come people people are like how come there are so many dogs because they have been around but just that they have been developing they are getting pushed out they have the dogs have been around in there in the jungles people I know people who go around and feed the dogs at the edges of the forest because the dogs are coming out you know you they know why these people go to feed them at the edges is because they are trying to prevent the dogs from coming into estates because it will be that will spell danger for the dogs you know the dogs people are going to complain people are going to complain the the dogs are going to be in danger so but the dogs are hungry so people now the feeders go to the edges to feed them and the dogs are you know they are wild dogs they're feral dogs but they are very smart and they very and they really harmless because all they want is food they're not interested to go down to the to your heartlands and do what whatever you know they just want food so the people the feeders there go to the edges feed them then they go back inside the the jungles they are very sweet you know but
the wild boar pun sama
betul exactly aku nak salahkan wild boar tu macam mana kesian pula so this is exactly what we are ini macam frustration lah kan
no gatal kau tengok aku punya ni rashes tapi aku memang sensitive skin
kau kulit kulit buaya
kau takde macam ni cover ni kan ni kan
abeh ada tulis arab ah
kena saman there's no such thing
I don't know about the saman part I know you that you kena saman if you litter
we tell people don't put up food water because the dengue and then particularly doesn't like that because dengue apa
you know they because they have they have a certain route right okay block this block I feed three cats eat eat eat feed feed feed feed makan makan makan ah dah habis okay bye bye clear
and then I go to the next block some people do that or some feeders they will just from one block X they walk to they leave the food then they go to block Y Z then they balik then patah balik dia orang patah balik then clear lah
kalau tidak it is considered littering
entah littering lah whatever the charge is whatever the sum is hundred dollars I don't know
town councils town councils um cat welfare society ya ya usually cat welfare society collaborate with town council and they put a sign lah dekat kat lift landing you know uh please keep clear within two hours macam gitu macam posters
bagus lah
block mana this block this block
kesian kan
macam back to macam back to nature eh
scout does I thought dia bawa kawan dia
ni depan ni eh
kesian eh
away from all the orang-orang
ya eh masa
macam what bila aku dekat uh botanic gardens aku kerja kat situ oh my god the otters came all the time and they were huge my god they are like
oh they have a certain route all my colleagues will go off first at ten o'clock they will be here and then after that you can find them dia orang macam ada very designated they like know where to go first first then second twelve o'clock you will see them there is like
uh I guess because botanic gardens kan ada lakes kan ada lakes ada eco lake swan lake and all the macam the stream stream stream and you know botanic gardens
the the the park rangers make sure that the animals don't get disturbed you know so uh when there are otters we tell people me when I was located you know like me when I was located no please please stay aside you know make sure ya we basically monitored people's behaviours so uh the the we were policing the people for the otters the otters I guess felt safe macam ada bodyguard
ya dah macam they were protected ya which is a nice thing you know and but it's so nice to see them they were so cute huge though oh my god the biggest one I swear I swear it was like that I was like when I saw I was like my god it's huge ya they're very big
because singapore there are a few a few families of otters they're not no they're few families dia macam different clans
are you cray cray are you kidding me they are different ya there are different families macam different hello macam macam tigers kan lions kan ada different pride
sini ada so they have the kallang clan the kallang one which is like the the family that lives ya alah kau baca lah dalam surat khabar you know the otter city the otter the otters are being watched by their fan club
ya they are macam a'ah they macam the hobbies gitu
ah yes they are watching the birds the ah okay yes macam gitu
mana ya alah of course lah they look the same mana lah aku tahu macam mana rupa dia orang but they are these these people are the experts right they they like okay that belongs to the kallang clan
uh so the kallang clan otters are the ones that hang out in the kallang area dia macam territorial lah
maybe they are another clan but then again you know yang dekat yang dekat kallang tu wah I tell you
uh or the ones yang pergi kau tak baca dia masuk kat
ah gitu dengan tu that one is one clan know
ya eh dekat bishan park bishan park pun ada tau
you know macam they have a certain it's just like cats and dogs and lions and all that this is their roaming this is their range
uh this is their territory kau masuk dalam territory dia orang boleh bergaduh
dia orang bukan macam um some canines some felines yang after a while they have to separate you know so I don't think so that's why you call it a family great technique family
I think uh tempat fishing punya people who are not allowed to fish but they still fish there
I think kallang I think one of the anglers one of them the babies got stuck the hook mati tau so sad
they macam they go to their mana aku tahu dia orang pergi mana but they have their own spare trait lah kalau kau macam pergi dekat kallang river side I'm sure there is you can see them I told you botanic gardens they do botanic gardens
to be honest aku tak ingat sejak bila when is the first time they came out but otters ni tapi uh
uh both apa ni uh I don't know I don't know I don't remember when aku nak kencing I don't remember exactly when I don't remember exactly apa apasal aku toilet what do you mean I come back lah
ya cakap jer but I don't remember exactly when the otters um
uh I don't remember exactly when the otters you know keluar but definitely at least uh you know five years I think
bila bila aku start perasan ni lah when I first started you know noticed the news ah not noticed the orchards okay noticed the news
masa kampung babe masa kampung-kampung dulu kan ada sungai-sungai otters nak pergi nak buat apa sekarang they're all where are they going to go
sama lah sama lah
these people these okay these animals are native so when they started ya ya they are native they are you know also they're from we have mangrove apa dekat sungei buloh tu kan so I guess they decided to jalan keluar jauh sikit lor
not care taking not care taking no no ya ya ya ya ya ya they are not it's not care taking but they care for them in the sense that they care for their welfare they will do uh they will do um macam awareness macam don't feed the otters do not go near them don't
you know if you see them stay away don't don't provoke don't apa apa you know so they do that sort of message they carry that sort of message but of course depending on the context lah these are otters so you know so when they say we say they care for them means they will like they know oh they come out at this time so they know their habits they know how many of them
you know they might even have names I don't know ya so there's this group uh this you know quite a sizable number of their fan club that actually know them that knows them well well enough to know that this one belongs to this and there are like seven adults and two babies meh ya you know from a distance I guess they record which is kau tahu macam
macam macam the ornithologist yang tengok-tengok observe the birds and they will also all these these clans but they don't necessarily take care of them right in that sense
you know the otters in the city wow can you imagine you are at bloody then otters that's like wow what a nice sight of course of course ya ya ya but you know ya because they are like macam unlikely sight
ya mana ya pythons ya pythons and then they ate the cats and all that ya there's one there's one recently uh couple of two months ago maybe one snake over at entah bukit merah or what the snake ate the cat the com cat
ya all these com cats kat bawah it's the natural predator apa natural hello this is a cats snake hungry ya so they ate been a few cases where the cats ate the snakes is it com cat
less and less what forest yes yes exactly so we are driving them out so the snakes are eating the com cats already quite a few com cats already mati because of these the snake pernah ada satu ada satu gambar ada satu gambar yang snake tu yang snake tu tengah com cat dekat depan dekat mak news ah snake com cat ah

if the feelings hilang already what
his one right I think his type of like macam
convincing or talk or apa apa ah in general
his type is to like macam lead you on
okay macam okay
humairah said that he still like macam cakap to you cakap
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he tak itu
so jangan don't don't think that that is the end of the world also
mm cheat juga so it's two ways
tak nak tanya lah
toxic bodoh
oh mana aku tahu aku ingatkan perempuan tu
you can't K the thing is kau tak boleh expect like a guy to look so great
cause that's when you know macam kau kau confirm tak boleh dapat
you know it's not their hati yang gatal it's bawah dia orang gatal
terus dia reject
kau reject eh
oh ya kau tolak eh kau cakap I I'm still moving on
I think he said because kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua kan zack is the opposite what that's why he feels like very competitive gitu dia tak suka
alah kesiannya you but did you tell him that
kau cakap apa dalam letter tu
comelnya okay
you should just tell him that kau orang together not because your expectation of a guy is
macam you should say that at least he tried it's easier
oh dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat
okay I mean dia tak teruk seteruk aku tau but
kawan pun boleh eventually turn out to be so
that's that is the beauty of like having friends lah itu jer
selenge aku ketuk kau kan kepala ke kau kau cakap pasal si zack depan-depan dia sia
aku I was like laughing behind the screen I was like I want to look at izuan's reaction
ya tapi dalam hati tu mesti sakit padan muka
ya lah okay you're you're moving on two months dia dah break up dengan kau two months
it's kenal-kenal
guys who kenal-kenal me also

ya and then after that I was like I was so shocked lah like mak dia tak suka
like the girl dia punya ex gaduh dengan gaduh ya I'm like
ya exactly it's not her what humairah madrasah ke takkan alim jer
you know that a guy from madrasah
suka dengan budak madrasah yang lagi satu then I'm like
but but look like at the kids yang dah pernah madrasah even if I don't know they have done it
K but very annoyed itu cerita lain ke
I literally gave up you know when he said that aku macam tak nak gaduh lah diam jer lah
he said what layer layer layer aku cakap am I not layering that one
feel uncomfortable ah like macam
okay it's not it's not bad that he tegur but tegur tu like
cakap baik-baik not not say
it's not his tone it's the way he say it he macam cakap can you not wear like that macam gitu
nanti lelaki will think otherwise that one that that one I don't mind
if he says like that I don't mind but he says as if I'm the I'm the macam I'm the one wrong
tu pasal aku dah macam marah that's why I was pissed
aku dah cakap apa terang-terang like kau nak pakai itu kau kau kalau cuci mata gitu then it's not my problem
aku pun pissed gila wei gitu dengar
I don't know we were talking about oh no kat dalam kereta lepas hantar kau orang balik
lepas tu aku tanya dia like husni was like talking because kita tiga jer kan dah biasa
then after that we just talk ah macam
err we need to talk about like macam kesiankan adina semua kenapa dia emo gitu
lepas tu aku bilang lah dia orang macam apa jadi
like as in apa jadi as in like uh why is she still feeling sad lah gitu
then aku just cakap in my opinion I think
dia masih belum move on gitu ya then after that ya
mm and then lepas tu
husni cakap maybe
err husni came to a conclusion he just said that um
because like uh that is why you shouldn't play dating app ni semua
ya then after that aku macam it's like aku cakap ah macam sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person itu jer
for fun also what kau nak kenal-kenal orang jer pe
tell me that uh takpe kau kalau buat pun jaga-jaga tau lelaki ni semua tak bagus
then after that aku cakap lah aku cakap dengan dia like uh the guy I talking to that irfan
I told him that about that guy ah macam mana dia cakap dengan aku gitu
husni cakap ya just um next time just be careful jer lah
then kata aku cakap um
aku bilang husni ah aku tanya dia in my in your opinion lah do you think it's even that obvious can you even see
pasal tu husni cakap no you cannot see anything what
it's just one line dah tu jer
wah it'll it will trigger me right if he say that dulu kau pakai tutup aurat lepas tu kau pakai gini
tak he never say that before but if he says it that I'm gonna flip out sia
and the thing yang aku pakai tadi kan baju tu kan yang colour purple you cannot see anything what
ya it's just the ke belakang what
pasal dia tak berani nak cakap apa-apa that's why
kirakan apa birthday surprise dia bodoh
buka buka gitu birthday surprise
lupakan jer aku tak kisah
aku pakai gitu pun like I fikir about my family
relatives semua dah tahu aku dulu pakai tudung semua
mm itu sebab apa because that one time I suddenly change ah I just suddenly like that tak pakai tudung
nenek aku makcik aku ah like because kita dah rapat gila that's why I don't mind what they say ah
then she she very abeh dia baru lagi
I I I just jawab ah tak ah dekat jer nak buat apa
lepas tu dia kata huh gitu eh
ah gitu lah buat apa
so just kalau kau tak pakai takpe lah
this is the first time I post about yang I tak pakai tudung just ambil gambar biasa jer kan
not tegur as in bad tegur ah dia orang macam cakap eh lawanya
I'm not trying to brag ah but they said eh lawanya kau pakai gini
then I was like oh okay thank you gitu
just so I don't try to bring it up lah gitu
lag ke
pasal dah ya lah
tak lah
aku pergi mongolia royalty tu
even the girls that I know that pakai tudung kan right
they they buka somewhat they same time as me I mean after me
I have no idea but they they buka also leh like they suddenly just tak pakai
cause dah biasa kan dah daripada dulu kecil then after that
kecil as in I started seriously wearing sec one
then the lepas tu holiday pasal aku ada internship kan aku tak pakai
then from then aku tak pakai
sebab tu aku macam like a bit hesitant to wear lah
it's very stupid if they ban that lah macam bodoh sangat lah
that's that's the bad thing you know because it's your adik right then you are the kakak you're supposed to show example then they they have the mindset that
ya you're supposed to learn from your kakak that's all
I mean doesn't suit as in macam kau tak ready gitu
lepas kahwin then okay lah maybe
like because we ignored it right macam kau try to avoid it that's why dia dah malas nak cakap
kalau aurat tu boleh tunggu I know it's a good thing to
obviously you ngaji kena pakai pe
tak lah tak lah tak lah kau jangan
kau macam really lapar sia
macam kering sia tekak aku
boleh juga ah
funan ada apa siol
lebih baik kau boleh buat sendiri siol
kan kau tunjuk aku gambar tu hari
ya oh wah lawa seh
perm balik
I texted you I say because I saw your your hair macam ada bangs then I I was like
aku rebond ni jer
kalau if you dye your rambut nak colour apa
oo yang it hides under jer
itu cool gila seh
their service is okay ah both for both ah karva dengan pearlista
a bit more macam
ya it's kind of affordable lah especially for students right kalau kau pergi pun
ya I mean for the day itself kalau kau nak book obviously full lah dia orang tak ambil lah
macam that time I do my nails for graduation
then I was like pasal aku tak boleh sampai kan kaki aku then plus kaki aku kecil after that they were like
eh I can charge you for children's price then aku macam ah children's price
because it was a voucher yang kita beli dekat you know celeb fest kan kadang-kadang ada kan
ya and then after that makcik aku beli so it's hundred dollars altogether
it's hundred dollars altogether so fifty for me fifty for her then fifty tu aku pakai untuk perming ah so buat pedicure
ada sikit leftover then they refund sikit
so aku macam okay lor
tak pernah eh I just don't want to do anymore it looks very unclean that's why
later a long time later nanti dia karat ya that's why I don't like
rambut jer buat rambut jer
your nails don't bother
or if you like this pendek right beach wave
eh no bukan beach wave
dia tak banyak volume it's like just a bit gitu
then it's lawa
ah ada ada red colour yes okay
okay kita kena berbual english and malay
okay cuba cakap
because dia course by united
tapi class ni kenapa dia ah eight hours
mm tapi work from home ah
are you being paid untuk course ni
dah um semalam ada meeting err dekat conference room
ah aku gather all the ten of them lepas tu dalam ya ten of them split into two accounts
so dalam two account tu ada dalam
aku nya old team ada empat orang
err the other team ada enam orang
six six orang dalam team lepas tu kan ada social distancing kan so aku approach err safety manager ah minta pasal aku nak get the message relate to them across um but um I don't want to split the err dua dua team aku nak err two teams to dengar apa aku cakap as one so dorang tak confused
I want them to know the anyway boss aku memang the the day before
dia dah dah cakap dengan aku lah what to say dia cakap firstly about the unpaid cuti tu jangan
jangan bilang customer
don't tell the customer just say that we are clearing our leave tak tahu apasal boss suruh macam be confidential about it padahal it's quite known in singapore banyak orang sebab tu in the end um but I have to say what she say lah she's on leave dia tengah cuti so um during the meeting everybody um listen semua dengar semua ye so the two err explain that the two unpaid leave tu nak kena ambil december
february dengan march
then kalau macam the situation doesn't improve
err start for this err unpaid leave cuti kena ambil
compulsory you cannot macam bawa to the next err month you have to err settle lah within that month but rotate err every member kena ada backup dalam office
so that at least ada one person to answer customers' calls
kena ah so macam today is one of the unpaid ah
unpaid cuti err for december hari ni aku ambil dengan another day next week
so dalam bulan december aku kerja seven days only
best kalau boleh pergi holiday
and tak tolak gaji
ah free kan dapat
ya I think civil servants ada restriction kan
but two years eh kawan aku kata they don't know indefinitely
then macam mana um then how they clear the leave
I think they can break I think they will pay that time got ada keluar news apa
aku tak ingat apa ah tapi ada ada incentive the government say because they know that the civil servants cannot clear leaves
so cuti they will back they will back pay will cash or something
ada kan
for civil servants confirm ada that day baru ada pe they will they will pay the err they will bayar
tapi tak ada yang you know the apa usually apa bonus tu yang
extra berapa bulan for government civil servants ah that one tak should be tak ada adik aku pun tengah
she also mengeluh because
biasa ah kita dah beli beli beli barang we always macam nak kena
they hope they hope dia macam she hope for the bonus to
dia boleh bayar balik ah bill bill
kau tak perasan ke yang bila kau dah stop kerja then work from home ni that your your that your apa tu expenditure is lesser
tak lesser ke
motor masih keep ah
kereta memang necessary for korang pasal korang a family of enam
family of enam enam six cats seven cats
tapi alhamdulillah lah aku rasa ada berkat lah macam I'm sure somehow eh dia dia cukup tau cuma kita macam rasa macam we maybe because we don't see the the income coming in every month as a lump sum eh so we think macam
we are restricted tapi actually barang-barang semua masih still go on
dia penatnya apa bila kau kat rumah then dengan kerja while working nak kena tengok budak tengok rumah kemas lagi sebab tu macam overwhelming
time masa off
mm betul
jemput makan eh jemput minum sila kan
dah dah settle
bila dapat tu results
then dia nya first choice ah
yang yang okay what secondary school will that be
masa masa zaman-zaman kita tu the reputation not very good ah
oh but eh now maybe dah changed ke
oh the neighbourhood situ eh
tahniah for your result
ah jual besi
every month every month macam one point three for one account tau
so yang bulan lepas err our sales
cuma two hundred fifty eight K
tak drop banyak tu from one million err dia dia start turun bila tau bulan june july august
dah start to decline then the number of orders we used to get like hundred over orders dalam satu hari
sekarang satu hari dua tiga ke empat order macam system and it's like cutting metals for like a few inches orh really really very bad the demand drop
err dorang buat dorang assemble untuk ah the machine assemble untuk ah oil rig masuk kan dalam oil rig
so you know yang macam equinox err shell axon order kat all the oil rigs tu when they put things inside the down hole stuff too ah that metal they they buy from us kita kirakan macam distributor ah sell the metal kerja memang sebenarnya kerja aku ni jual besi
ada macam-macam size the round bars the tube all the tubings nanti they will order macam certain sizes then we need to look at the drawing sometimes they say ah we want to make something from this so what do you have dalam stock
to offer um benda-benda gini ah nanti dalam inventory tengok ah size yang kena ada abeh aku kena plan inventory for them the stock level must be always available so that bila dorang beli bendanya ada tak payah tunggu
cuma different product ah barang lain so
somehow yang bila yang last year tu bila aku dapat promoted tu from one account they ask me to also take over another account
so kirakan macam two accounts combined ni is the two biggest account dalam company mm
which is unexpected lah yang pasal aku kan baru habis cerai that time kan
then ah after the divorce tu
somehow ah aku tak tahu ah then the boss yang cina tu kata um we need to look into your portfolio you need to grow yourself so
then err dia tanya aku nak ke tidak macam if bukan aku dia akan offer to another person then the other person if not ambitious ah this girl dalam company aku ni there's another account manager yang very ambitious
then dia pursue dia punya degree at the same time I with her own money pasal dia nak aku rasa dia nak position boss aku boss aku asia and ah
asia-pac marketing and apa eh marketing and apa director
so dia kata if you don't take tak take up this position I'll have to offer to another person the your colleague
then the other person ni dia okay dia ambitious aku tahu it suits it suits her lah tu macam dia bukan ada
not someone yang there yet lah but pada aku macam not the
ah tak
bukan experience dia macam dia micro manage ah
abeh dia imposed macam kerja-kerja macam dia punya
dia bahasa kalau dia buat format eh
kalau aku buat format nak kena macam gini nak kena ikut tau team members semua kena ikut cara dia gitu ah dia akan check one by one kau buat kerja betul ke tidak like if you don't do it um betul-betul dia macam
dia send one email nanti dia kasi
dia buat ah step one step two step three really really micro manage punya kind of person jadi macam
aku pula bahasa agaknya aku tak teratur tak organise langsung
aku akan usually dengan budak dengan team members aku bilang dorang you do like this tapi pandai-pandai kau lah buat cara sendiri lah takde format punya benda tau dia lain dia bahasa kena ada format dia nak kena after this dot must have exclamation mark atau question mark that kind tau
very teratur very neat and tertib tulisan dia pun very tu kadang-kadang aku pun hairan macam mana dia boleh
aku totally opposite tapi boss aku cakap macam dia cakap err she will also be promoted but she will take care of the well head activities then aku take over the down hole activities so that time aku fikir err try jer lah ambil jer dulu lah that's how sekali dah take over dengan tahun ni dengan COVID ah kau sales baik dua account twenty one million ah tahun ni tak aku rasa
work wise ah work wise macam aku boleh manage ah cuma every night sekarang almost every night nak kena kerja
kena buat report
kat during the day tak there's simply not enough time mana answer customer nya email then err nanti ada quality issues lah supply chain issues logistic tak datang lah then at the same time kau kena check into inventory then check into macam housekeeping at the same time kita kena think of ways to reduce the inventory
macam-macam lah dalam satu hari one day you can like
tak boleh habis so nanti benda-benda report yang bahasa nak kena churn out data
aku buat malam kat rumah atau that time during work from home tu kan tu lagi productivity terus turun pasal siang anuh budak-budak take care of the kids punya tu
nanti aku macam takde aku tak boleh focus tau ah macam aku punya walaupun tak banyak kerja rumah aku boleh just let go tak buat apa-apa
tapi you can't macam tak boleh tau the data that you're you're doing at that point I rasa macam
takpe ah nanti I need macam quietness at the night baru aku buat ah tapi pada time malam aku dah tidurkan elly nanti aku dah energy aku dah gone that's why sometimes aku cakap telefon apa jamu nak ambil
yang deep station yang tu aku beli kan
itu aku rasa help with tangan aku that time
pasal bila lepas two months aku rasa macam takde effect aku stop tapi right after aku stop tu
about one month tu tangan aku clear tau dah tak gatal-gatal lagi tau there's a period aku remember aku jumpa liyana um she also noticed eh tangan dah baik your hand is better now
sekali one month aku tidur rumah aku start balik

really ah aku tunjuk aku can actually come to senses ah like tunjuk kau macam aku ambil
kita punya kedai handphone ada Twitter
banyak ah jap eh
eh takde eh
takde Twitter ah
camne eh nak explain
oo best ah kau kena tengok ah eileen the burton
eileen the burton ah eh for example ah the things yang dia highlight
yang benda yang dia highlight is like especially macam perempuan do this padahal kita pun buat laki pun buat like macam kita padahal kita buat not only with kita partners dengan members pun sama tau like macam kau tak tahu pe aku satu minggu penat macam for example dan it can be as simple as dan
this week aku penat gila ah kalau tak boleh turun boleh that kind of thing tau but we expect him to understand that eh kau dah bodoh pe
aku hari-hari kerja kau masih nak lepak sini ah that kind of thing ah it's like it's as easy as bro uh this week I quite full lah cannot come to the shop or not that kind of thing
ah this kind of thing ah so dia kata if it's a true love or if it's true friendship if you understand each other without saying which doesn't makes sense ah
abeh dia kata like macam we expect to do that we expect
macam for example dia cerita kan ah from a real life punya experiences dia balik
dia balik then after that err anak dia anak dia baby dia give anak dia some food anak dia tepis toddler ah nangis terus
kalau bini dia dah sepak ah I mean dia kata aku dah bingit gila ah dengan bini aku but he's my son lah but what I did was I try to understand him
like macam why did he why did he behave this way dia nak berak ke pampers dia ini ke dia gigi nak grow ke gini gini ah that's why then after that that was thinking ah dia kata dia macam why can't I behave
ah like macam senang cakap bila kalau
benda gini we always talk about girls kan macam eh what's wrong nothing that kind of thing like you can just tell me
but that's the thing ah like but at the end of the day also most guys also dorang tak tahu how to talk about
emotions macam suami kan
macam if they feel something diam
dengan dan pun diam unless kita brought it up really force him to talk about it then he will talk about it
a'ah tu pasal ah dorang tak ada orang ajar I mean like they
in a way lelaki kan
that's why dorang macam ah tak kesah pasal for example kalau laki laki ah siapa-siapa nak keluar kan
kita punya anak sedara ke siapa pe bapa pun macam nak pergi mana keluar take care eh jangan naughty naughty eh perempuan nak keluar kita kongkong that kind of thing lah like macam
laki we are just left to be everybody understand everybody have a way of thinking that guys are they can make it out there ah quite expected to know everything or like kau should know find for the answers
kita is still need a manual pe in some ways cuma that differentiate people lah like how they actually view things ah like some people they will macam
tak tahu continue to be lost lost lost lost lost lost sampai ke mampus anak bini semua masih lost ada kalau people have gone through a lot of shit kan then after that macam eh things cannot happen like this ah I want to find something better baru dorang improve
macam that time yang client aku hugo tu whoa
sama ah like macam abeh nampak dia tengah going undergoing stress tau a lot pasal bini dia kat portugal and dekat sini semua
abeh berbual dengan dia berbual berbual habis terus aku just open up ah aku just ah butoh lah aku cakap pasal bapa aku semua kan
aku cakap err apa nama dia
oh like macam that time bapa aku gaduh kat kerja tak ada orang defend dia that kind of thing then macam see everybody expects guys to like
macam siapa lelaki ada siapa nak berbual takde siapa-siapa pe
dan dah macam
okay ah we have no one macam you know then my friend ah kata ah aku tengah stress kawan aku kata
you know I'm not the up for the psychiatrist thing dia kata
laki ah laki you you don't know how to open up pe
a'ah it's seram
macam that time aku dengar satu talk tu ex-feminist kan aku dah cakap kan dia buat documentary dia feminist
and dia buat documentary ironically pasal err apa nama dia dia buat documentary about macam opposite of feminist ah kira men ah men fighting for men's right dia interview ni semua biasa tapi asal dia kerja
dia shut off that side of dia punya feminist side ah so kepala otak dia semua dia just judge whatever comes up to their mouth kan dia just judge
then bila
it comes to editing she have to listen what to everything so dia dia have to edit out filter all the content so dia realise never once

kau tak pernah tengok cerita tu when they see us
kau should watch aku ada cakap dengan kau pasal ni interested no it's about
raping ah charged rape and murder oh but they were totally innocent but dia nya system inside dia nya ah police
so fucked up that they will separate the kids without any macam apa parents or lawyers kan dia dorang cakap okay that guy from another room
blame kau yang anuh mm that guy from another room blame kau yang anuh but then this guy another room they keep blaming each other but no one blames themselves ya so dorang make it like a story by dorang dia punya problem
end up macam kecoh ah now dorang dah tua sia sekarang
rabak sia tu
actually donald trump ah who ah that time kata donald trump banyak
keluarkan wrongly ah wrongly reason black people out
orang buat people will do things but then if in matter of the in the in the matter of kau tahu ke tidak is siapa yang sampaikan media apa that's why media is they say
sometimes aku ada fikir balik whether trump is really racist atau tak
kau tengok eh
before trump was a president fifty cents semua rapper semua suka fifty cents ni semua suka trump sia
aku grow up hip-hop pe trump memang
respected ah tu fifty cents kata eh dia jadi president semua orang benci dia
pasal dia pandai dia businessman apa
first punya election cause whatever you see on the media is just a for example forty per cent of americans the most americans semua like next ni semua dekat kampung-kampung so when you go to kampung-kampung I want to make
america great again orang semua suka kau ah ah so you get the majority votes
aku lupa ah
pastu dia dia pada aku kan
at the end of the day kalau kau dah enam puluh tahun kan life kau memang macam atuk nenek kita pun dorang cakap benda annoying pe that's one thing second thing kan this guy
new york kalau kau boleh hidup dengan mafia you can work with mafia to create trump tower when the workers who built that tower is mafia nya macam mafia control them but ni kau dah bagus mafia control everything new york
apa nama dia concrete bricks ni semua semua dia control
abeh kalau kau boleh survive that makna kau bukan bodoh sia
tu ah macam cakap world is being too soft ah
like macam that's the thing pasal aku macam aku nya aku selalu step macam jahat
jadi terlalu baik cause I have to acknowledge the devil the shadow kalau you err psychologist ah dia cakap kau nak kena face your demons kau kena acknowledge kau punya demons
so all these closet perverts ah be that all these closet perverts ah dia macam
um macam macam kau semua kita cakap pe kita open kita gini gini gini punya orang kita tak bedek kita tak macam
tak ah aku baik baik baik padahal musibat
ni kalau kau bersih pun maknanya kau hidup macam kermit ah hermit
pasal it's not human pasal apa-apa yang ada dekat kita itu semua part of feelings
pada aku is wrong to apa
feel a certain way but it only jadi wrong when you act upon it
kalau kau act upon it means kau dah conclude the whole
macam salah a'ah macam siapa nama dia
ah dalam islam umar
umar paling fierce placebo
no matter is considered allah
umar umar bila orang kata rasulullah meninggal kan
dia kata pe satu kali korang cakap kat aku rasulullah meninggal aku pancung korangnya kepala
abeh terus err apa nama dia
it's the other aku pernah dengar this talk orang ni cakap ustaz dia aku ni pemarah gini gini macam
bermakna it's not wrong we have to chill lah paling sekarang siapa next ah apa err the third khalifah a khalifah is someone paling garang sekali pe
macam you got to chill lah it's what you do you do
tu aku tak suka orang cakap ee kau ni
err cepat marah seh cepat marah I mean like pada aku cepat marah is a bit people who are very attune with their emotions
macam people want entah lah orang just
sebab tu lain orang lain pe
macam aku dengan mata air aku selalu macam aku cakap raised punya voice kan I'm not angry I'm just I mean I mean I'm I'm not angry at you I'm just I'm trying to acknowledge my feelings but when I raise my voice macam kadang aku tak marah dia it's just macam kita berbual pasal something ah we get hype up macam I'm not angry at you I'm just ah accepting the fact that I am angry about this
at least aku tak terbawa-bawa ah at least aku tak like macam
err apa nama dia
step ah step baik tak acknowledge ah I'm fine I'm fine
butoh I'm fine
kau hide it under the rug wonder the rug will be big enough sia kau dah tak tahu mana nak buang kau punya angry
dah berapa lama ah
tiga puluh tiga puluh thirty three
okay ah this is about korean show ah eh korang jangan judge aku
this one korean show aku tengok pun sama pasal apparently this one kid
macam dia nya life just
memang fucked up ah memang rabak ah but then she work inside this company whereby dia banyak tolong orang ah but then at the same time
sampaikan orang tap
into other people's phone untuk dengar conversation semua
terus friendly orang yang this guy another guy in dia nya company kira orang dia baik gila ah macam bukan nak cakap baik gila but then he's
entah macam very straight ah with dia nya principles dia kira cakap sometimes certain things kau shouldn't kalau kau dengar
kau shouldn't say
certain things kau dengar kau just keep it to yourself pasal kalau kau benda benda macam gini eh kau boleh disrupt orangnya friendship even though macam aku dengan kau gini kan aku dengan kau macam okay depan korang aku baik
belakang korang aku might be talking shit but sometimes that is the kind of thing that sometimes people just want to express dorangnya feelings it's not meant for the other person to hear ya
so dia cakap I know you're working but kau kena fikir balik apa kau buat pasal this kind of things it will disrupt orangnya life
that's why macam pada aku orang yang macam step baik kan whenever someone said something bad they will assume oh dia ni jahat
pasal kau tak pernah acknowledge anger you don't understand anger
macam aku just nak cakap jer ah aku not satisfied with this what's wrong with that
sebab tu that time aku sangkut sia cakap ni apa ah ah nama cerita dia is my minister
bagus sia
it's not about a okay ah very like ten per cent about love like the most is about dia punya how fucked up the whole situation is ah
pada aku semua cerita best ah korea ke apa ke
that's why aku quite shocked sekarang macam aku quite interested to macam tengok like korean shows
pasal dorang kan kalau kau tengok balik korean they are very well attune to dorangnya feelings
tu pasal aku suka tengok cerita lucifer
oh asal pasal yang macam dia acknowledge whatever feelings pasal he's not human mm he's not human abeh dia jumpa psycho ah psychopath pula dia jumpa psychiatrist dia and dia talk about feelings oh ya
and like macam the way dia take it like macam oh aku feeling this way eh is it ah that kind of thing ah so macam interesting
wah then dalam one of dia nya show dorang aku dengar this this guy cakap
macam dia tak tahu tak tahu apa dia nak tak tahu apa what's going on around the world dia buat hal dia macam gini sakit hati kau mampus ah macam gitu ah dia clueless about everything around
sun tzu cakap dekat art of war
I mean if you look at life as a war kan macam everyday is a constant battle ah
you can battle with a lot of things ah dia kata
kau kena tahu diri kau kau dah tahu the people around you ah
whatever everything kau pada aku aku boleh relate ni benda ah and then like
macam walaupun bila orang tu buku ni dia tulis untuk war pe but then you can look at it into business in life
macam battle ah for example
sekarang eh
the battle is for me to win korangnya hearts boleh cakap gitu pe
abeh macam I trying to win a friendship I want to get this kinship between us that's a battle also pe so kau nak kena tahu diri kau kau kena tahu kau punya people apa kau suka pasal apa kau suka apa apa kau tak suka and then from there aku boleh win the battle lah
aku pernah sia that time tengok after that watching dia nya like the series kan aku balik rumah aku just hate everyone
that's walking around aku sia aku macam like fuck sia korang like
aku macam aku tengok semua orang macam korang like do you guys see all these things that's banyak orang tak nampak
ah macam sial lah tak ah macam like these kinds of things that happened in the dark ah macam usually orang nampak semua macam let's say
a'ah from apa orang tunjuk jer pe
pasal sometimes no matter how bad the person is also kan kau nak kena tahu like what make him that way
tapi pada aku macam no matter how bad the person pada dia dia dia betul ah ya lah that's why like macam ada orang kata like
someone else's war is someone else's peace something like that lah dia punya line
it's like pada aku like macam wow it's like kalau kau nak kahwin
kau nak anak kau islam kau tak boleh kahwin dengan orang christian pe mm pasal pada dia minum no problem whatever dia believe in is different than yours
so to them after that korang gaduh then tak boleh cakap salah siapa pasal korang believe in different things
ya lah means like dia macam
that time adik aku pernah cakap ah dia bilang aku cakap kalau let's say eh the relationship korang gaduh in a relationship kan korang gaduh make sure korang berbual with each other face to face mm then gaduh quarrel with inside
ah that's not me ah yes kalau kau nak quarrel dengan aku kau quarrel dengan aku aku sendiri
macam that time aku text mata air aku dia kata apa
kau mesti ingat eh kalau aku tumbuk sesiapa sekarang kan okay let's say aku tumbuk kau kan if you get punched the only pain yang aku with the puncher is accountable for is when dia punya fist hit kau punya muka other than that kan tu semua self-inflicting pain
ni macam yang johnny depp member amber heard ah
oh dia tu lagi satu sia kesian sia
berbual kan a'ah aku ada dengar sikit juga
johnny depp tengah kecewa
ah terus end up jadi pukul pula
in a way dia punya suara like they just dia bukan marah tau dia just disappointed with what she turns to ah
like sebelum tu aku nampak kau macam wah like she's that perfect girl then suddenly
once that's why macam
ah tu pasal ah
macam apa romanticism dia cakap like macam one thing dia tak suka pasal romanticism ah is
first love macam
kau tengok jer kau dah tahu tu dia punya kau punya love one he questions the one kau tengok kau belum kenal that person tau
macam everything is based on feelings
abeh dia kata the only normal person eh
semua orang semua tak normal actually semua orang messed up
kau tak tahu dia punya problem tu pasal dia kata like macam
it's best to have a communication ah like macam bila kau jumpa orang kan I rather don't believe in like oh dia ni cantik ah kalau kau rasa dia cantik maknanya kau suka dia physically then after that kau get to know that person ah
then slowly like macam
ah then work things out from there ah you have to know like macam oh
does dia love aku macam
cause some people dalam dia some people
pasal when it comes to love kan cause suffering also come to place juga
dia dia dorang ada ratio dia
banyak orang kita can vibe with
best sia romanticism nya talk pasal I mean
even though aku suka dengar pasal tu kan it's not that aku tak romantic as well at all tau
like macam eh I cannot behave this way towards my girlfriend cause it will make her have this romantic mindset which would actually damage the relationship in the future
err ya like macam gitu ah expectations ah like macam a lot of the things ah like macam merepek ah tak masuk akal ah
aku need kau ada Twitter tak lis
tak pakai ah tapi ada dekat handphone kau
pasal aku nak kena tengok some examples ah
eh actually aku boleh ah tengok pakai ni aku boleh record sambil ni takpe aku tengok Twitter dari aku punya ni
handphone then aku aku highlight some of the romantic romanticism punya ah ni
vulnerable lah like macam kau takut nak jadi vulnerable
a'ah kau tak nak
oh azmi ah azmi cakap apa
si azmi pun
dia kes dia punya orang pun dia apa tau dia kata macam dulu dia macam kita macam baru kenal dia kata diam dulu relax
but then what make him change was he went travelling then like macam only on the third day baru dia berbual dengan orang terus macam dia punya last day kan ataupun orang tu last day
terus macam eh sial ah gerek gila sia
when I can talk to you in the first day and then we have a great time together sejak dari situ dia just macam open jer ah dengan semua orang dia boleh berbual ada selamba jer dia berbual jer ah
you cannot force the process ah macam kalau dia cakap gitu aku pun takleh expect anyone to oh betul eh aku try gitu cannot cause you have not gone through that process
you never truly understand it ah so if you skip the process memang
plus kita busy with a lot of things
err apa nama dia ah to throw away ah
and like really ni satu annoying perempuan pergi screenshot mata air dia gi send
tak this is all the stuff that aku scroll aku nampak ah
perempuan love this kind of shit pe
panjang gila mampus eh macam si dia tu highlight ah
err apa nama dia dia kata romantic romanticism can only be practised pada orang yang tak kerja orang yang tak ada goals in life
macam you want that macam that is not healthy sia
macam hundred of hundred per cent of your time or ninety per cent eighty per cent is being
err spend on someone tau dia macam just talk shit just make yourself feel better I love you you love beautiful that kind of thing kau spend pages tu semua
kau tahu macam you can spend time writing this tapi kau tak boleh write benda-benda yang lagi berfaedah
like macam
ah like macam god meant to take someone macam sial ah
ni cantik cantik tell him queen
macam ah
hais sial laki ni ha padahal aku belum tengok dia kata laki ni sial I mean like oh okay so you have to lie now
dan ah macam dulu dan macam oh thanks bro macam whoa best pe dan ada dekat sini
sekarang apa-apa dan buat nanti syahmi will find a reason to hate on it
pada aku ni macam a little bit romanticism in a way
I mean like macam
to to a certain extent okay lah there are some guys who just like openly like ni semua macam that's the thing like macam
aku tahu sia macam from experience I know girls
who secretly wants some guys sial lah living okay tak payah pergi jauh adam sendiri siak berapa banyak attached women go to him
the fuck is that abeh kau nak come to aku like macam kau nak pure gila nak mampus
macam no I only think of you macam
kau jangan bedek ah kita manusia ah sial
dia kata one of the things that
sex and marriage sex and love intertwine so dia kata apa tau
when you kira
and then err apa nama dia err
so they intertwine sex dengan love so if someone can treat you like good
bagus gila nak mampus tau
sweet tapi dia tak boleh fuck you well ah
kau terus down
kau macam oh this is not true love
or in a way ah tu pasal how I see it ah like most girls kan bila dia dah give themselves too easy to a guy
yang apa nama dia ini ah dia kata like macam so aku macam try to understand tau
kadang mata air aku ada sikit annoying ah which is aku understand pada aku like macam
dia believe in romanticism ah
before dia know aku pe so like err
I mean like it's a like confirm confirm tak boleh tau
and like macam kalau kau buat maknanya dah end of the story that kind of thing
it's not that aku nak main orang lain or what ah
but it's just that when you place that kan so slowly kau subconsciously
kau punya mind will go lower and lower in a sense that
err kalau apa nama dia that mind macam so kalau kau like orang lain kan sexually dah kira salah kalau kau have fun kalau that time dia ada issue with aku keluar kawan aku perempuan aku dah kenal dari dulu dah lama gila
terus dia tengok story macam eh you look you seem more happier with her tu aku dah kenal dia berapa lama macam aku aku happy pun salah ke
that kind of thing like macam so they will like if someone can replace can if someone can give him happiness
maknanya that person is for him then macam happiness comes in different form
so kau jangan think it the way just cause gini abeh kau down
abeh like macam oh dia dah tak suka aku like this
takleh keluar tak ada kawan tu semua that's what overthinking is a more commonly err
ya happen in that situation ah so macam all these toxic punya
toxic punya pemikiran ah
and like macam
pada aku most of the time kita tak gaduh it's just that disagreement jer ah like macam we talk about something disagree macam dan dengan ni
ah dan dengan mel
tapi tak sampai kita merajuk it's just that aku disagree atau certain things like macam dia kata I cannot sleep ah terus macam asal oh I
don't overthink kau bilang aku jer asal let me talk to you lah like macam
ease your mind sikit ah apa aku boleh buat dia cakap tak nak nanti menyusahkan kau
abeh terus nanti kalau dah bilang then after that dia come to conclusion that dia overthinking abeh dia ingat macam
oh aku selalu buat orang susah lah aku selalu macam kita kena gaduh pada aku ni tak gaduh
ini bukan gaduh it's just us communicating jer
can you stop pasal that's the thing
macam all these romanticism kan benda-benda gini fikir gaduh
pada dia kan love is love hundred per cent all the time having fun
that is like the the extreme err apa view of romanticism ah we have three more minutes my friend
dah terlalu banyak benda personal if you're listening to this
tadi korang cakap berbual pasal happiness pun macam
it's just like macam how orang europe confirm pergi holiday dekat bali
dia kata ee
like macam
pada kau mesti ah pasal kau punya standard lain apa dia punya standard lain
macam dulu aku bilang aku pernah bilang korang tak aku berbual dengan razi then razi tanya aku

nanti aku ajak I think I will ask my nephew my cousins these two
we're not into gold yet no no no we're not the makcik makcik who likes wearing gold
I think today there's really not much to talk about lah because macam
there was a lecture online today tu jer ah
talking so slowly and plus dia start the lesson lambat
but dia datang lambat
really really kau asyik datang sekolah lambat seh
no but the previous semester usually kau on time for school
speaking of attendance kau tahu aku that time dapat email dari sekolah cakap
just masalah ni like macam
okay K this is err out of topic but like you know leh ni tak tahu siapa asyik reply aku punya tak eh reply aku punya pula always like replying to my instagram stories
yes yes you know this person and dia ah sama course dengan kita masa I think sekarang pun sama lah
mm boleh can
ya Q asyik reply to my eh why do I keep saying reply to my apa tu lah reply to my ah instagram story
but it when he reply right it's always the randomness things macam for example if
and then he will wah tempat ni kat mana seh
no tapi actually dia punya his malay is
ini playground aku
apasal dengan budak ni ah maybe
ya and then but tapi recently kan
so dia macam tanya eh this week intern apa eh this this week is what week of internship like as if he tak ada classmate nak tanya kenapa dia kena tanya aku and then
oh and then err I will reply ah this week this week twenty then the next week he will ask me this week with apa untuk intern
then I will reply the same thing we twenty one but then I don't want to tanya lah you don't have any classmate meh macam offensive seh
tak tak tak uh this one he asked me during the week of internship
while kita tengah masih intern not after
but but dia but he got message you on instagram what that time kau tunjuk aku
no lah I'm I'm not overthinking about it and I I don't like to fikir banyak sangat about this pasal anyways if
if he was actually trying if he actually ada motive kan
dia tahu pe aku ada mata air so why would he even try
my replies to him are like so boring like literally if when one talks to me they will just tidur
exactly I am the most boring person in the world and I aku tak suka social interaction
kalau if
stop it and then and then ah he asked me that this is like tengah malam so like twelve midnight
but then I was so lazy so malas to like look up the thing cause I was already in bed macam nak tidur
I told him that and then he is like oh okay tak apa dah jumpa
and I okay you just wasted my time and then he started to move on pasal
uh apa tu about what's my and everything then and
he actually pandai seh his is three point two you know
and then ah I see wah your cumulative is so good then he ask me your intern kau dapat A ah then I say
ya I get A what about you and then dia cakap dia dapat B can't believe he dapat B actually kan that time I berbual with captain ho dia cakap most of the boys dapat B meanwhile the girls get A
aiya whatever lah it's over already anyways your tinggi pe so like there's nothing to
risaukan ya
then he said alah university kalau university pun uh he will go to plymouth
apasal you like he is it ee
K K kau suka dia
tapi but we are the same height what
ah ya ya can you please tell me what happened I want to know nak tahu
notice apa why ah why leh
huh siapa yang reject kau sia I mean you're like damn pretty
aku feel so betrayed
jauh pe orchard is so far
pasal your jokes can be quite
kau tahu the wing wing joke
exactly kau tahu it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny tak kelakar pun
is it is it macam blind date like you
just did not know him or kau dah nampak muka dia and then you decide to go on a date dengan dia
it's always the cute guys yang buat kita orang macam like this
I think I think you kau ada cakap telegram oh
ya he was practically ghosting kau kesian
actually ah I have one calon for you
and he is he is actually mak aku punya friend punya anak
so like but we kind of grow up together lah so sejak kecil until besar
tapi kan the thing about him is the thing about him is dia pendiam so
eh no dia macam pendiam with certain people that's what I notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so I think it's like secucuk for you lah
adik-adik ya stop it sia
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then I know kau suka lelaki yang boleh fight dengan kau
but he's the only candidate that aku tahu ah yang I can recommend to you
no I I told you what he is my mum's friend punya anak
so like I kenal him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends sejak dulu so mm
you you like guys yang suka bantah is it
ya I faham I faham
but that kind of person susah nak cari seh because like nowadays guys are just
I don't know you tell me is he is he like really kasar dengan kau
to to like date you and then to kahwin with you
actually uh after the truth or dare game right I thought dia
tak suka aku because like I feel like maybe
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me
then I am like wasn't the tak oh is he not at me
ya lah tu
huh I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know kau tahu
dia masih berbual-bual dengan ex dia seh ya
yes yes there was the story then ah you know then after that I teman him to go for one office takraw
punya sessions just to watch lah and then we were walking to the sports hall abeh I think kawan dia saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then ah kawan dia upload to
snapchat and then eh his ex nampak lah then
yes dia playing hard to get but then she's also like macam
not sure about him but also playing hard to get macam mana
so dia orang dah break up lah
ah aku just tak suka when like uh apa tu girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend punya kawan I mean just make it clear lah that
you guys just kawan and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what kau mean by that ular ular kepala dua is it
but why would the girl buat such a thing to the mata air sia
so aku rasa it's okay if you want to buka aib dia to me because I don't even know who he is so
wait so does that mean at some point kau pernah suka lelaki tu on
like kau orang are just platonic friends lah
the mata air dia just have issues lah I think because remember remember when aku used to have issues dengan yasmin
I don't even know why and then now kita we're friends so like look ah the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference entah lah
speaking of the office you know my sister ah I told my kakak about uh all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
the cameraman kena zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then uh dia akan uh bend into like the people around dia punya reaction that will be so funny and then the title should err the office two point O
aku is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to buat kerja for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they macam how is the company going to maju right and then
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance habis tu
ah after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person lah and then mesti perempuan finance ni pun cakap
asyik pass kat aku seh this one you pass back to err si logistics dulu then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is dah kerja kau pe
mm it's like macam as if they make it look like macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal
they are the ones that making kerja aku susah you know so frustrating
um I I get what you mean though because macam oh at
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID kita kena work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually kat kerja I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so kecil dari desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and then oh and then aku punya boss every damn day dia akan suruh kita on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
mm I mean ah almost hari-hari kan my boss will tanya everyone oh what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
macam every damn day hari-hari nine thirty sharp zoom meeting without fail dia akan tanya
um kim yam road nak pergi sengkang okay lah and then plus you know bila nak pergi and balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit oh my goodness
ya so depressing tu turbine intern so huh
wah so jangan lah
is it jannah dari mata air
kau tak eh
who who who do you have in mind to be jannah mata air
honestly I cannot wait until jannah kahwin though because like
I will feel so happy for her macam yes
any guy yang dapat jannah is a very very lucky guy
no because you kau tahu pe I don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
sepupu aku they are either lagi tua or they're younger than me
so like I don't think jannah will be interested in dia orang
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have ah girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew jannah tak suka lelaki yang younger than her
kan saya ni like shaza really shaza pula jap I mean you deserve the best also but jannah also like deserves the best
it's so merepek
it's like americans don't even take dia orang punya elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
orang dekat dia orang like oh have you registered to vote
it's your masa masa hadapan that you are thinking of it's the masa depan masa hadapan of your children
especially kat singapore
woke culture has been like taking over singapore punya twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers
it like it's macam
are you guys have to be woke in order to like macam so you guys don't ah offend siapa-siapa I'm like ugh stop it stop it
macam no offence na na na na na but ne na na na
uh actually women dia orang minta for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time ah seek catering to their needs better it's like macam for example you're looking over fence ah this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut okay nevermind
nak you pergi terancung
actually for my malay aku dapat A two no but there was only after I retake the malay paper
at first the aku dapat B three
mari lah
belajar otak you still got into so it
tak made a difference many ways was like the two best years of my studying life
and aku don't regret at all
and like it's just so lepak
ya I just miss so much and the lecturers actually do give a damn about you and your welfare not just kau punya studies
um ini apa
most of us tak suka miss judy because she was like so naggy for some reason she was so naggy
I remember ah the time yang bila kita baru dapat result for which company kita dapat for intern and then I didn't get lots but and I was so sad
so miss judy got me out of the lecture theatre and dia just she just tanya me ah apa jadi lah then why why asal I'm crying
I said I didn't get the companies that I wanted to and then she just no it's okay takpe I mean she been didn't say takpe but like it's okay
cederakan diri lah
ketabahan is like her macam patience
add to a certain extent lah that cause kau kan perempuan
you macam shiok seh tiba-tiba
it's I yang bilang
kau takde tissue that time
but but that blood was because you were you were scolding this lelaki yang tengah buang sampah sembarangan kan
she betul-betul seh
just route lain
how come I tak tahu it was a fake story
why your cats like so kasar like that if you train them
oh my god mister alan is just so comel you know
mister mister alan ada snapchat
best gila just shiok you know
eh aku tak sabar to get of the country like it's been so long already since we've been like at home and like just in singapore I'm so I'm really getting bored nowadays
ya then after that they say I don't know I actually didn't read the news so much ah but then nampak macam dorang nak buka like give us masuk like kasi kita masuk tapi macam they just I don't know what I don't know what was what happened ah because I don't really read the berita right but I was like
I mean because no no no dorang dah tutup
for like apa berapa bulan dah so like ya I mean I think ever since like the COVID really boom so much right I think they actually um close it already so like
eh betul ke
sekarang are you sure
jap for real ah
okay I guess I guess that's why I don't know because I mean aku baru kerja masa tu kan always night shift mana ada nak siapa sempat tak lah syafiq kyle not my aku dah aku dah dah sebab tak ada kan because of this COVID dah tak ada drama kan so macam dah
apa what the heck
jap so jap but did you know which one is it because I just know there's like zul ariffin
zul ariffin eh um I think I think he there was ah because you know because of COVID kan dorang tak ada buat drama baru kan like now they are in
sedih pe
okay ah but I never cause because of because of okay not really because of COVID but like a few since like a few years ago kan then I already like because of apa friends punya apa-apa nama dia I I guess influence macam gitu they be like K drama K drama K drama ya that's so
aku eh no I feel like
I mean you got to watch the drama first then after that you will be in love dengan character dia pe
lah cerita lama tak best I mean I don't really watch all cerita lama but I watch lah like at um a few years ago punya kan
I watch like macam
I swear every time he macam oh I don't know what to watch goblin and I'm like bro are you
weh boring pe tu aku tak boleh okay no matter how good a show is right I will never re-watch uh not that I'll never re-watch sebab I wouldn't go until six times three four times
but ya lah because you know after I mean I can lah because you know after watching a show right you can actually macam like you know I don't know about you ah but for me after watching a show or like when I watch this show I feel very attached to the show
boring pe aku tak boleh dok macam tu
wah okay that's is that's a new thing for me like macam a new information of someone
actually now that I think about it aku rasa aku tak tengok dia punya spiderman tom holland I just saw you know like macam all the the marvel the big big shows like the what is it called captain america eh not captain america ya civil the civil wars the last one endgame so I only like I only like apa saw that big big one are the main main shows lah I don't really watch the specific um only
ya like you know got the batman lah all that different different one right so I don't really watch yang macam tu
wah but eh but you know because of COVID also right aku this year aku binge watch banyak gila korean drama
okay jap aku okay first aku tengok doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic kan so it's like macam um is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously ada that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then um I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think kirakan about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay ah ya to me ah so I watched the doctor romantic first lah yang first tu so it was that that show is about apa banyak doctor doctor punya scene ah so it's like banyak so jadi punya tempat punya scene wah you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like eh can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery punya punya apa nama dia what do you call it uh surgery punya
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama punya they are so tip top bro
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors pakai oh my god cantik
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same tau like as in like but it's just that why can't it why macam just macam tak sama tau aku aku pun macam
ya so I was like shit okay so dia cakap ada hotel bloom I'm like sabar am I am I suppose to wait for it macam happen like
so dia macam tak ada tak ada
ada lah yang kan aku ada buat aku tengok doctor romantic two dia ada dua dua
I mean maybe not so because kadang-kadang orang nak kan people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama eh dia banyak international fans tau
banyak gila international fans
eh even suria dorang tunjuk tau aku macam
ya ya you know cerita um my is gangnam beauty
eh park seo joon eh bro my is gangnam beauty yang
ya but it's that apa cerita pun dekat suria then I was like sabar
itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka but I think I remember dulu bila back then also selalu tengok because selalu bila kecil-kecil kan mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada box kan you know the android box that kind of thing
dulu mana ada benda tu semua kan like macam
ya so there's always a singapore nya channel so dah tengok singapore nya channel tu kan kadang-kadang like main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya button tu semua kan so kita tengok ah like some of it macam all the apa nama dia channel one is it yang all that dub basically that thing lah
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember ah when I first like came upon on that that apa channel lah aku macam apa benda sia ni
I think ya oh my god okay even aku rasa even kalau dorang kalau park seo joon cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka
but ya I cannot lah watch that kind of show I just need the original punya
ya but honestly for me also kan kalau tengok um subtitle dengan drama at the same time macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga ah sebab you know you wanna
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm uh is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because kadang-kadang
aku dengar jer kan
kan sama sama
but then but then you know sometimes kalau macam I mean not not um not korean drama also like like anything ah because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like macam make faces so is like macam if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then macam you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I tak faham
oh no the the translation the translation is like very macam so formal right the word
yo same ah same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix aku tengok malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like whoa what are saying translation ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham seh
tapi like kalau kalau apa malay drama pun kadang-kadang dorang guna all the peribahasa ke or like the
like kalau okay singapore nya tak sangat ah singapore nya
oh my god I love anak metropolitan
youths okay ya so oh my god but I love that show though it's like so cool so gerek
ya but if I'm not wrong anak metropolitan actually ada dua dua season kan dua ke tiga season but the one yang dorang tunjuk kat youtube sebab if I'm not wrong sekarang youtube ada then me watch pun ada tapi aku tak tengok ah dulu kan toggle kan I think toggle pun ada ah but like
who actually I don't know who uses me watch or toggle though honestly ah cause like kirakan dorang punya platform I don't think is that is that apa nama dia friendly is it
then kadang-kadang dorang load lama tau like as in like you know macam kalau nak masuk go inside the app then it will like load quite long to actually show you the page show you the ya
ah ya memang memang macam tu because that time aku kat malaysia then aku nak tengok viu tau then aku tak boleh tengok sebab I'm not in singapore
I guess I guess so that's why macam aku tak boleh tengok so I was like geram ah macam shit aku aku ingatkan aku kat malaysia aku boleh tengok so I'm like ah sedihnya tak boleh tengok because because benda tu kan because benda tu kan tak boleh tak boleh uh jumpa mana-mana sangat kan so I was like a bit sad ah gitu lagipun macam I thought holiday holiday pun I still got time to watch apa drama kan
ya so macam sedih ah
I guess it's not really holiday it's not really holiday a holiday ah sebab aku kan kat rumah kan macam eh sorry not kat rumah aku kan kat rumah cousin aku aku ada cousin yang tinggal kat malaysia so I go there ah everytime kalau nak gi malaysia selalu singgah sana so that's why ingatkan dah kat sana dah ada wi-fi semua then I'm like shit
ya bro ya I mean see because of COVID mana kita boleh pergi malaysia dok what the heck
ada ah tapi macam just macam isi minyak pastu like beli makan sekejap pastu balik you know that kind of thing so it's not like you go there and like staycation eh eh sorry
huh oh aku tak pernah dok pakai train uh pergi
kau bedek ah five minutes
siak okay from here to aku faham ah tapi it's from woodlands kan
abeh kau apa kat dalam kereta kau just tengok
kau punya phone
eh then they should start making at dok
ya ya ya memang memang eh kapal terbang kot kau bro aeroplane how slow can the aeroplane go
aku actually pergi tu aku um in my whole entire life aku jarang pergi just for leisure
I get no no no because um kirakan selalu aku kan cousin aku tinggal kat seremban kan so aku selalu gi seremban no seremban is like you know um johor then I think melaka then after that seremban
ya you know okay I tell you the furthest from here that means the furthest um country in malaysia is perlis is perlis so right apa um uh is perlis so perlis is near thailand so it's like aku selalu pergi sana sebab aku ada cousin kat sana juga ah not cousin ah but more of like makcik pakcik yang tinggal kat sana cause uh arwah atuk aku dia punya family semua dekat perlis then after that I go there ah sometimes right so um I got this place ah got the padang besar padang besar is like the big ass shopping area kat kat perlis so when you go there right you literally see the border of thailand
ya ya ya ya ya you can literally you can literally see the gate entry of thailand kat apa padang besar tu tau then aku macam sebab that time aku bila aku pergi ah first time aku pergi padang besar tu kan then aku tengok ah aku macam because I was thinking the I think car lah cause kat sana tak boleh it's too packed to take the uh uh apa bus so um I took the car ah abeh lepas tu aku nampak ah
naik sebab aku pergi dengan my cousins and my pakcik makcik ah so it's like banyak orang kan so kita naik bus jadi dah naik bus tu um dari sana dari from singapore kita naik bus till like till like perlis or till like half way through then kita change another bus to um perlis so from perlis kita dah ada kita punya all the makcik pakcik kan so kita just pinjam kereta ah kita kita gi jalan-jalan kat itu so dah pergi padang besar tu aku first nampak aku macam why is this why is there macam apa like thailand punya wordings eh kat sini eh macam what
ya so I was like so so I tanya ah
is that close bro that's why from singapore actually right we can go straight I don't know whether we can go whether we can actually go by car until england kalau tak salah
ya ya ya so so so that means from thailand then after that kalau kau pergi atas lagi then you will be connected to another country lepas tu kau boleh pergi to another country then kau boleh ya ya ya so until england kalau tak salah yang paling yang paling
yang paling jauh ah yang kau boleh pergi ah
ah motor okay ah sebab motor dua-dua orang jer kan so like
right oh my god so it's like you can actually just kirakan ah what is it called uh
you know I wanted to do backpacking cause like macam why not right
but then it's budget ah you cause dah bikin
but backpacking selalu
itu backpacking nama dia
it's I thought backpacking selalunya ah maybe I don't know what's the meaning
I guess no because I thought backpacking is like apa memang bawa minimal barang abeh lepas itu
gi oh my god walking eh
wow just gila aku tak tahu siapa yang sanggup jalan kaki from here to
tu macam apa tau tu macam dah apa uh berapa ribu tahun lepas
weh oh my god jauh though
ya dok even from here to jurong east aku tak boleh dok
I mean tak boleh lah cuma macam the thing the the
bukan tak kind of macam malas gila ah nak jalan ah
that's why so I'm like what the because you know kan aku dulu sekolah dekat jurong east kan so macam like macam I kadang-kadang kan kalau terlupa bus pass ke apa then macam nak kena balik sekolah
itu pasal lah kau ingat eh apa aku dah penat-penat apa pergi sekolah apa aku dah penat-penat sekolah then aku nak kena jalan balik rumah oh my god that will be like so tiring sia dengan bag sebab dulu bila kecil-kecil selalu um bawa bag berat-berat kan so macam I don't why though huh
no wonder I was like because that time you told us about you were walking at like jurong lake gardens aku macam
aku ingatkan kau actually apa nama dia kau walk just within the
ya ya and like within within jurong lake garden jer tu pasal aku macam okay lah apa-apa yang
jap siapa punya idea ni
science garden science centre ada park kat belakang
actually kau jalan macam jauh jer
but then bila kau jalan kat reservoir macam jauh tau
asal kau pergi jauh-jauh eh sebab dari sini sebab kalau naik bas ah kau dari sini kau boleh apa I mean that is a bit
then why you have to go science centre bagai
for real ah sebab actually from here kalau kau naik bas ah kau boleh naik I think naik bas tiga puluh kat sini abeh kau stop somewhere near taman jurong abeh lepas tu nanti
ya lah ya lah I mean that's why I was like wondering asal sampai science centre sebab from here but
so it's like ya taman jurong so I'm like dari situ then boleh jalan pe that's why I was like science centre asal seh
ye lah semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau confident sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau eh kau cakap kau dah sampai
ya I mean kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun eh kita semua dah berapa tahun obviously we have to be like independent
wah you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like macam okay so dah nak dekat kiamat kan so like why not I apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap kan kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat madinah ke makkah ke kau tak kan jumpa dengan dajjal kan so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when uh one thing yang aku tak tahu is that dorang cakap that apa nama dia even even orang yang duduk kat makkah dengan madinah um
no no no you dajjal can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the apa malaikat ah so like macam but then the thing is within makkah and madinah there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami tau
in in the end of times ah so there will be so uh because of that tsunami or earthquake it will keluarkan orang-orang yang
beriman gitu ah
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in itu so yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri they will keluar
dorang akan stay inside so that's why yang so that's why I was like thinking abeh kalau macam tu kalau in the end of times kalau aku pergi sana juga then what's the point though sebab because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore kau mana ada experience tsunami or earthquake pun kan
ya you know you know that time aku pernah pergi japan dengan sekolah aku pergi sana for school trip lah kan so then lepas itu aku
oh itu pun
ah australia dorang apa afini uh apa eh tak bukan atikah ella dengan alia dorang pergi melbourne so aku pergi japan dengan puteri dengan ifa so aku pergi sana then lepas tu um kan you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big apa gitu kan so
ya so kita uh yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi hiroshima dengan aku pergi osaka
yes history all that so dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal history kan so dah alang-alang belajar history kita nak kena belajar lah pasal we went to this macam ambulance place eh not ambulance macam fire place gitu to like learn about macam ways to like save yourself from like apa
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually ah we did a earthquake punya simulation
bro kau tahu sebab dia ada stages tau bila that simulation kan aku pergi we all had to take turns going ah I try ah because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself ah just anything to protect yourself
so aku pergi sana aku macam so there's like different different um
apa ya
ya so it's like uh they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us uh yang medium or towards the high a bit just to rasa rasa kan
it's just the tip of the iceberg ah you think just a bit ah gitu kan
it's not the worst ah it's not the level seven ah it's like level four or five gitu ah dia kasi kita try kan kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar siol it's really it's really like bergegar like macam I can't even like
jap so kalau kita
jap okay so kalau kita tengah earthquake ni kan kita boleh masuk sini tak
tak as in like as in like it's not a good place right sebab benda ni kan
right so like macam
kat bawa jer kan but then jatuh juga so like
tak dorang cakap kan because kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk cover kan
ah kau kau guna anything to cover yourself just to like macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau
ya ya ya so because kau punya head yang paling important pe dia yang dia yang control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why ah macam apa nama dia um they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like macam wooden ke apa ke as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
ya oh my god that one sedih juga though kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi I mean okay tapi kau punya kaki dah
ah and like kalau dah penyek kau confirm nak kena amputate
ah itu itu lama gila
ya so that's why a bit scary ah gitu kan
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic lah but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is apa kirakan it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well lah like sekarang
singapore actually dapat
it's good that kita kecil ah cause kalau kita kalau kita besar confirm tak boleh control ah sebab
hmm lagi nasib baik kat singapore ada banyak quite a number of uh hospital kan and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think ada quite a number at least at least two ah ya then now cause sekarang they are all starting to built community hospital
if I'm not mistaken community hospital yang all the firstly is all the very minor minor punya sickness ah are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing lah
and it's also for people yang from the major hospital transfer to
I mean ng teng fong ada community hospital
ya so that's why so sekarang dorang dah buat community hospital kat sini so I guess if I'm not that time aku pergi
mana eh woodlands ke east side east side or north side aku pergi aku pun nampak they are like trying to built something then it looks like macam community hospital also dari luar ah sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok renovation kan then nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu kan
so like you can see like all the you know like kalau for houses I don't know if you know ah but for houses kan nanti they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then kalau for hospital they would show hospital punya itu ya so macam from the outside we can
I kind of saw like macam that that thing lah so I was like oh I guess because kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah
I mean is sekarang banyak gila foreigner datang sini seh like banyak gila
actually sekarang
wait so bapa kau masih kat sana
alah sedihnya sorang-sorang
oil abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa
ah tapi kalau oil but he's not really in contact with oil lah right he's just like
I mean baju dia kau dah cuci actually that time kan bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja airline kan so dia pun nak kena fix fix all the aeroplane punya stuff right
ah ya it's time kerja cause dia cakap dia balik rumah then dia nak kena tukar baju because apa dia terjatuh oil ya then I was like I was like shit apa bau sia ni
it so strong macam toxic
ya but then actually kalau kau pergi I don't for you but for me aku kalau pergi what is it called petrol station aku suka bau dia
low-key tapi aku macam
ya so but then that time apa dia kena kat dia punya baju kan so baju obviously aku rasa dah in contact with the skin gitu ah
ya so it's like dia dah mandi kan then dia dia dia tanya aku ah eh ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi eh
okay so ya dia nuts he was carrying the table and then after that the the slot just doesn't go in mengamuk ah then I don't understand it's like julie was trying to tell him to just carry the thing out just carry the table out like which I said then he was like no no no no cannot carry because the thing is not locked I was like sudah lah just angkat jer lah he wants to have the table locked jadi dia punya tu a catch under the table I know right that's a assault ya allah lepas tu bising-bising I don't get it tapi si julie macam just angkat jer lah kau then kita tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh like lock lock
hello who's that okay so ya ya so what's the story about the makcik seth ya
bodoh nak mamps
I told my friend about him then he's like oh oh oh okay he doesn't know her but like macam bodoh sekali then I was like saying no bodoh is an understatement this is really beyond bodoh B B but I don't know

dia orang nak test concept eh like concept of a show
oh iya lah
what you have to watch a show first then kalau kalau kau tak suka
ah eh who who are they like new faces ke orang lama tak ada like popular artistes
I don't know I used to I mean like my parents used to watch it all the time right suria so when they have the on kadang-kadang kalau ada show yang macam okay okay then I'll sit and watch ah but to be honest I cannot remember any any specific title
ah ya like it's just like macam background noise gitu
tapi macam I I mean the content okay kadang-kadang like the some documentaries there was one with um that girl dalila I don't know the girl with that cornrow hair
ah dalina dalina during bulan puasa ah bulan puasa macam kadang-kadang like sebelum buka then baru will watch
kalau tak macam err
oh my goodness mentang-mentang ada library eh kat situ dia orang dia orang dengki eh ya
kan aku dah lama seh tak pakai zoom call
oh ya jannah ya ya I can force jannah then kalau kalau aku berbual seorang
oh ya ah you have your but eh then where where is your sister dia tidur kat mana seh
nice eh tengok tengok tengok sikit
tu anjing eh
abeh apa oh lah horse ya allah
anjing eh eh cantik
cantik seh babe is that ros in the photo
oh ya ya betul betul betul
macam-macam lah kau mengarut
oh okay okay cause like right now there's a lot of discussion about kalau you dah age thirty you must have at least hundred K in your bank account that kind of thing
like a a a real high flyer then of course you can save a lot more lah cause right now a lot of like twenty five years old are saying oh I already saved fifty K then you no need to get married meh no need to buy ke you know ya then still spend money what
oh no then sekarang are you actually stress about the wedding or stress about all these things that you feel you're stress about or
aku ingatkan kau fikir banyak sangat ah
ya kalau kalau kalau bukan ros kalau robert kalau alah apa-apa jer lah sebab kau rasa macam robert you know would have the financial means
but the think is russell financial means are also above average jadi you know apa yang tak cukup ni sorry kau
is it dia
right but then cause of COVID and then they say oh people will are only gonna start flying in twenty twenty four then ya lah rasa takut tu mesti ada right sikit
oh okay okay okay that's nice so now your loan amount berapa
eh thirty three dengan hundred jauh beza seh
wah that is okay lah tak apa kau kau cepat-cepat collect then
ya two percent then tak apa lah just pay lah five hundred every month then after that you slowly accumulate your wealth back again and then you can invest the rest what cause you can always make your investment grow more than two percent so that's the logic behind it lah
mana dia nak cari masa nak do relief teaching on the side
ya tu pasal lah then banyak seh burden dia banyak burdens to bear
kesian hais I know
but like what could they possibly be bringing home eh dalam banyak-banyak itu baggage gitu
so so in the end flight tu delay ke tak

the other time like last year or something and then I actually uh duduk at the rubi for like
satu jam and then I was opening and hooking and unhooking the kasut from the shelf and then the shop owner look at me like huh you want to buy or not
then I legit do that for so long and then I end up tak beli apa-apa then I just left the store
ya I think they look at me like I was about to curi the kasut or something
and then I diri there and I was going to check in lah then my phone semua then I was scanning the safe entry then my safe entry macam lagging so
I tunggu there for like three minutes or something because my internet macam

eh that's like uh you get a kembar

no haven't that time almost we want to go but then like macam our schedule doesn't fit
macam got cancelled because of like I think one of two or them couldn't make it
ya ya then then she say that time she she got go back like um apa ni
ya she got two one one is very younger then the second one is like macam teenage
like in a way macam I don't know lah I don't I think they with the sisters but then she she the one that uh want to go first or something like that
I think I think got some wedding then they will stay there then oh I think the nenek
the nenek also was there the nenek lives there or something like that
mm plus eh tak payah tak payah tak tak
it's like apa tu what they say is it investment
like the higher rank one they they do that macam they they buy a condo because their pay is already high what so they they buy a condo
apa ni ya
I think they see also lah macam what kind of like background
family members support also you know macam like they like oh okay lah I got this amount like I
boleh tak start balik
okay I have a friend in in lah so macam they are they are brought up in a very err
ya so like macam
so like macam most of them um
they want to like go to like macam apa ni
so like macam wah like very interesting like they have they know that it's already like fixed you know
so I like wah so so lucky then like they like very chim know then like macam
susah sangat eh
ya if if they want if I mean like if they want to macam
work in a line where requires like or masters then okay lah but then I feel like macam
the type of work or like macam what you want to do
so it's like more of like macam
he was like uh telling me afiq actually kan um degree tak tak perlu sangat lah macam like if you want you want lah I mean like
huh my my senior ah my senior dia cakap actually at first also I want to take degree then bila fikir balik macam
um waste uh not not not say waste of time lah macam like you you need more money what to pay you school bills and all
apa tu enhance or like
like he can just like get in already because of the experience that he get macam like his
ya so first half is um local then macam I think around four months lah four months is overseas
so I got a double cert macam
like uh apa apa apa apa lah
in half a year and usually like that kind of thing take like macam a few years or like macam in one year ah
tunda lah kahwin ho then dapat anak dah empat puluh
chey sedih seh tu tak lah
no lah it won't this one ya tiga puluh
eh lelaki dengan perempuan masalah tau
ya eh really I mean like macam okay for for the girls eh
I mean like of course like we as guys like we want anak or what
then imagine kalau like you know that you can't um produce anak
then like it's another thing then you feel like macam
family tree ya ya zuriat wow
I wanted to say zakat zakat different thing sia
imagine if like your jodoh is like a older like for me eh a guy my jodoh is a older girl
or females is more like macam I feel that uh like girls kan macam like now the this like our generation kan
but I feel that now like macam they want to
unless ya unless your pay is like macam ada commission that kind
macam not
so that's why you need to have a back up ah macam like
satu ribu tu like for the longest time
ah then your the one that you saved up confirm [dah] makin lesser what
like a heads up eh macam now people start to think oh I need a like a back up plan I need savings that kind of thing
unless your company have like macam monthly pay cause uh ya cause like
um one of my friend uh apa ni
err dia kerja events so like monthly she got like a fixed pay of like two point five
uh apa ni she
um jobs ah macam like ada commissions so macam they give a lot of like commission things tau so she need to do a lot of like
so macam she will take in the other
uh person punya slot
so like okay let's say like macam you you already have a thing to do
then after that but still the commission will like the double commission tu will like
ya so so like macam it will add up lah it will add up to one commission in the end but then that commission can like
macam whatever they sell they will get like a few percent of it
gila kan
ya lah she untung lah
two no not cawangan err
so that this group will do some of this group punya work then this group will do like ya
crazy lah so macam like
ya but then of course the the shit that they go through like banyak masalah lah ya
ah sembarang ambil
uh got lah got but then um macam if you need to work
you really need to macam you need to put your work first like that
instead of like family of what which is the point like my friend macam
at a point of time she give up she wanted to like macam just um quit
so like macam
ya but you really need to stand for your right lah even though macam that pay is good ke apa kan but you must know your
so that the their apa ni the one that will take over them
ah dia orang punya anak will not have
so that macam like in like some people have like emergency money what
oh at that time uh they have a saving so they were sharing with me lah and my family macam they have a saving
uh okay their emergency is like so weird it's like macam okay emergency like wedding
like dia punya anak wedding
exactly macam okay like let's say macam
err last minute um the the anak couldn't pay for certain things kan
err then macam they need to help out in a way like that kind of like emergency lah
ah macam like those those small things macam like maybe uh venue
ah macam like
not it bukan bukan lupa bukan lupa but then she couldn't pay
because she's okay her ikat tunang
ah ah that one I don't know ah okay dia punya ikat tunang is two years
so I think she like macam want to get uh married lah already lah macam more earlier so they push like one year plus
then the mum was like think like saying are you sure I feel do you have like enough saving already then she say err nevermind lah buat simple simple
so like everything was like tergantung then the mum keep asking have you paid have you paid have you do this have you do that then she said oh ya ya ah later lah later lah then
but her side is already then she like macam
take it very lightly so I was like thinking kau nak kahwin ke tak nak kahwin ni kau serious ke tak serious ni
then I mean like if you want simple then just like nikah then makan sikit-sikit ah this one she do like a sanding sanding
then like got this and that I mean like macam okay the the quality is not as like
you know this girl ah she everything she tangguh tangguh tangguh then after that
cannot take it already the mum like there's no updates or anything then the mak ask her
then she like err ya actually ni nak kena bayar lagi berapa ribu gini then the mum like
then the mum the mak don't want to say like she got money to help
then her mum actually um help out lah in a way like macam a few percent of the
ya only like maybe like nikah lah
I think it's a that's what like every parents want nak ah ya because like even my mum also like
uh don't want lah we make uh some some somewhere that is like macam bigger ke apa lah
then like if more bigger means more money then she said err tak apa lah err I mean like
I can help you to help you like settle this or that then like of course my brother is like the first child so he don't want to like macam burden my mum
so but then my mum wants it so like macam
dia dilemma lah whether to do or not when she said then then the girlfriend um ya the girlfriend also like
said thinking like macam
uh tak apa lah kita buat simple simple you know gini gini but then like my mum want it to be like
um sempurna lah in a way looks good like people side
ya so like macam but the family is quite small
so okay so like macam not a lot from her side then from my brother side my brother really thought was like okay I will invite like less err he will be inviting like less than a thousand of people
macam maybe six hundred or five hundred depending on ya dah how many
know like macam
ya ya see kalau ada kemampuan lah I mean like ah ya then that ya then that's the that's one of the emergency money
and then like after that like macam maybe house or what
like macam
uh so that's why like macam
and plus like macam it depend how you
investment eh apa tu namanya um
like macam like you will get money if you
like insurance like that tapi you will get monthly money ah
no macam every month you pay something then after that you will receive um
ya tak
that's why I mean like definitely we want to adult with a clean way like macam a clean way of saving money or like getting investment kan
masing-masing ah eh masing-masing

oh ya ke
so basically in school hari ini kita start sekolah pukul um nine

bab kita um analyse companies and their sustainable uh efforts lah so from there we have to think of um
tapi simple simple jer lah we went to makan err nasi goreng

oh saya tahu
sebab saya
it's all on food if food is free and can be replaced with something rather than duit then err
ya I will boleh jimat banyak sangat ah
clothes boleh like kadangkala jer boleh splurge
for me it's err mengada-ngada
err ya other people like example macam service crews cikgu
that one itu tak boleh tahan ah
kalau dia orang betul-betul like
tak tahu like boundaries like as sebagai
spam jer lah nanti besok pagi dia tengok all of your messages
boyfriend kita semua kat army
like semua benda like the system capitalism semua sudah tak ada
then you will bring about chaos lah sebab semua orang akan like fikir
like of their own selves like in ways where they can survive so for example macam food semua food resources
tak ada system ya
so some would tamak kan
so dapat uh apa tu will definitely
dia orang will definitely be selfish lah of like whatever resources they can get
and it will eventually macam create havoc
so as much as capitalism semua orang cakap macam tak bagus it's like much needed in the
ibu makan cheesecakes saya beli empat puluh lima dollar

like suddenly a lot of people main layla sia then after that like I don't know she got stronger
so macam layla
eudora eudora eudora pun sama
then siapa lagi
ya a lot of like older older players ah they revamp then macam nowadays
a lot more punya yang we don't use last time macam layla
enam puluh dollar on the game I have no words I am

let's start playing again ah cause like aku pun nak try naik balik tau cause aku drop sampai like aku from mythic sia mythic you know abeh aku drop so it's like
the fact that okay okay asal kan asal kan kau bahagia ah eh asal kan kau bahagia
I don't think they revamp karina cause macam I don't see a lot of people playing karina so but you can always try then mana tahu kau dah baca kau punya itu build builds semua kan mana tahu kau boleh jadi pro karina so ya and ya it's not as toxic surprisingly lah aku tak tahu asal which is weird lah cause normally kalau cause I always play mage dengan support right then I whenever aku play ah I aku punya sekarang pretty bad ah like noob lah noob so bila
noob ah and ada slurs so macam
nowadays they don't like last time they they ada lah they got say
all the mean words but now they don't eh surprisingly so macam

then like dia macam dragon gitu super cool
dia punya actually I've tried before lah and
aku tak bagus ah aku tak boleh main fighter apa aku jadi fighter macam macam
like real seh everytime aku jadi fighter kan confirm confirm aku mati banyak so it's like a no no but ya that dragon is pretty good macam dia punya ulti kan you basically become dragon
okay lah I don't know what's the term lah cause I'm not as nerd as you but um jadi dragon then right nanti okay dia actually kecil tau dia punya character tak besar sangat then bila dia lepas jadi dragon dia dah collect macam don't know what is it called I forgot apa five whatever it's called
then um meet gordon besar sia dah macam
dah macam besar lah besar ya but I think ya you should play you should play that one or
I mean kau pernah main apa and it's when you play freya bagus lah
so macam maybe at that point of time the the the the the the player wasn't as good lah weren't as good but I think if kalau kau
kalau kau just keep on go kan and main more games and practise right confirm kau boleh jadi top sia hear already knowing how nerd you are
then dia punya balmond bagus sia
legit legit super thick like macam susah nak susah nak bunuh dia
and dia pandai main dia tak macam kau macam dia punya ulti kan dia tak hit minion
dia dia tau pandai nak hit so macam I get I get it but it's okay I know baby steps baby steps
actually tank right I think kau pakai hilda atau masha is good lah I mean ya we've talked about it hilda atau masha
aku kalau aku kalau fighter atau tank tak boleh
cause like aku tak I'm not the kind to step up lah aku aku tiada pendirian lah sia
paksa kan nampak

but we are fine with hanging out together lah kau step jer mana kau punya glue glue alamak kita boleh hang out sendiri lah chey just kidding
so just lepak lah basically eh but but we wanted to go trampoline kan so it's like
kita rest on the first day then second day we just go trampoline all the way so we go morning you want to go gym then after that
I was like eh abeh korang pergi gym dah lah gym boleh dua orang jer abeh aku
so macam I boleh lah korang nak pergi gym pergi lah but then maybe aku just I don't know go for a run but
aku tak tahu that area okay I am not very familiar
container dia pun bukannya besar sangat kan
okay never mind we just make do with what we can okay on that day so we just see how it goes because I aku pun tak nak I just don't want you guys to macam
you know like I don't want you guys to in the morning leceh have to go for gym also I mean it's quite tiring right if we sleep then in the morning I mean it's refreshing in the morning lah of course but
right we're going to cook breakfast right then we cook breakfast then we mandi eh we mandi first then we cook breakfast
container macam you already bought the container mah
bought eh as in like I don't know lah aku macam nak stay in the container
the other end is dhoby ghaut right eh salah
okay what quite dekat what actually
so that's the first plan the second option is the one yang itu lah yang
cause from trampoline park right we'll be sweaty already if we want to go other place aku takut
I mean even if we tukar baju and everything we still busuk mah like we still feel very icky and sticky
bro oh my god okay if that's the case then kita punya our breakfast we just eat mcdonald's lor you can lah can lah not not so eh okay what mcdonald's one of the days
hey the what a hater I mean come on sponge isn't supposed to masak also you know come on now
oh sorry I don't go there I don't know about all this stuff because macam macam I see what's in front of me so my little pony is cute like that is cute like that there's nothing go behind it unless you really go make your reason
sudah eh
um there's a lot of animes I like to watch I I'm a anime fan lah so Netflix surprisingly dorang macam makin banyak anime dorang masuk-masukkan kan I was like wah quite quite amazed though sebab dulu Netflix there's not much anime
you still hype dia masih ada serious serious because right now um the movie just came out abeh macam
all all of us uh kita pergi tengok movie dia kan
there are some of our friends also dorang masih belum tengok
and also tak salah aku the season two pun belum keluar kalau kau belum
ah kau baru nak start the hype you still ah don't have to wait so long for the season two
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu season two possibly dorang akan keluar like
ya Netflix it came out ah slow but it came out came out right april tak salah april twenty twenty that's when the hype betul-betul naik ah sia and apa everytime
like uh there's some macam
apa eh I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that ah the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also err dia nya manga because normally mangas like macam for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach uh naruto
dorang punya like the amount of copies that they kan
berapa lama eh tak salah aku one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay lah this is just a rough gauge all of them ah took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
untuk demon slayer for the manga aje eh
dia wah it's only four years ah
dah hundred and twenty million dah
with drums ah ah tapi pasal kan tu ah japanese kan kita melayu kita kita kompang
masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya eh asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar eh
ya the like what they say ah apa actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how apa gui is ah as a person
ah tapi
dia nya other than the anime
um apa soundtrack dia kan
because one thing about uh anything in general ah kalau kau tengok a show or something kan
it is more emotional kalau dia nya soundtrack is a very macam it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer sekarang the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa yang the opening
and pasal
that it becomes like everyday object everyday ah actions are sampai they don't know ah they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but wah it's
for all the animes ah I watch semua ikut yang this dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang
macam aku rasa like one shot there's this thing called one shot animes dorang usually macam forty plus minutes abeh dah tu jer
dia macam a short a short film ah kirakan but it the sometimes like
orang fikir like oh the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters ah kadang-kadang even like those thirty or ten minute films kan it leaves a very
uh everlasting mark in your in your memory macam tak boleh lupakan it's that good ah like the story storytelling even uh the soundtrack cause come on man ah without soundtrack anything will be boring lah
it's okay man it's okay aku nya A math pun
bila entah eh macam there's this kind of stigma ah whenever you go to school or like university ah in that case
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh
ah I I shared this with my one of my friends ah dia pun tengah ambil university but I think is like I think ya so ya ah bro that one is just that's just one person lah don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
especially kalau kau buat coding atau math kan there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where macam oh wait what's going on I don't understand sia and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly atau atau secondary school tau
sebab mak aku english teacher
ya and also macam being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called err from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
like err apa tu there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is huh
macam apa sia dia ni like asal asal ah kecil hati exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like eh don't don't be so abrupt don't be so macam rude ah kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini kan the person who speak all those abrupt words or macam kasar kan dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam oh ni semua ah normal lah takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe] so I'll just continue with what I'm doing ah
adapting and also apa eh what's that word again uh you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
abeh kalau your
then kau akan dapat suspension
ah kau ah eh sorry
after one year then kau kena re-enroll
um when you are in a academic warning punya ni ah ya
if you haven't get academic warning then asalkan your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save lah
ada is that macam kau nya topic bukan topic apa module module is that module macam
kau nak kena belajar pasal another language
like macam malay atau mandarin
orh is it the same as macam
ada benda kita nak kena reverse the structure of a of a word
kalau english post office abeh melayu pejabat post dia dia dia macam reverse ah it's in that that way ah like buat orang macam confusing
pejabat post
oh like apa dialects ah slang slang
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the macam
ah baru-baru punya module yang apa nak nak kena ajar like aku rasa for example like
uh in the market I guess one thing yang
macam banyak-banyak tukar is the job finding
kalau let's say err user experience kan
normally macam tak banyak kerja pasal user experience mah because it's not that known to be uh to be like a proper job orang fikir macam alah ni orang lain buat boleh buat pe macam it's another job
on top of the job that orang tengah buat but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object macam kau pegang cawan
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right abeh kau imagine kalau they handle ada duri tak comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics err the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though macam it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
macam kau tengah bad mood abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa
like err happiness like for example kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja
abeh kau rasa macam eh how am I gonna get to that level so kau kau uh bertungkus-lumus kau uh cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak and that process buat kau bad mood
some people dorang dah so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset macam oh since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
like kau imagine ah like he said in two years eh
cam rezeki akan di diberikan like don't focus always on the rezeki focus on like
what make things work in in the last time ah macam retrospect ah but for now it's more like
which is why I appreciate like all those people yang even though it's just ah comic books or like anime kan it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
ah for this anime macam all these one
that's why like ah apa eh ya macam demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience lah the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
it's happening in in that macam ah alternate universe lah in a way ah ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is dorang they apa
dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam the movie walaupun that movie ada banyak orang macam superpower kan tapi dorang buatkan character tu macam he goes through everyday life as per normal but uh they somehow macam in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though ada orang dorang tak ada ah superpower tapi a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something yang buatkan kau macam strongly
uh huh game of thrones oh tak eh
tell you about it like macam eh macam orang gemuk like they want to achieve being slim like have that ah that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like eh dah kurus eh sia baik [pe] but actually kau kau tak tahu like the process itself buatkan kau nak slim kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam eh kau dah kurus kan
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal uh weight your optimal image tapi the
the thought of people macam dorang perasan like kau tengah berubah at least macam you looking more slim or looking more ah toned your body looks so toned then kau you'll feel better and it helps to
tapi it's it's I guess this little happiness macam kalau nak go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness buat kau macam maintain your course cause ada orang let's say pasal yang language one aku pun tengah another language is called C sharp programming language
for this different generations like sejak okay ah this past few hundred years ah there has been certain developments in uh certain parts of uh humanity like last time there's uh agriculture industrial evolution kan then there's uh
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam
aku nak keep up to date to certain things jadi macam I'm not
uh losing in the race for finding jobs atau uh skill sets so
aku push myself ah I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes kalau kau buat benda sorang like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
especially if you okay lah probably yang buatkan kau malu is kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam eh ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku assume that walaupun susah but aku I can just Google apa Google is there for me to help boleh search senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri
uh the the amid the Google search yang kau buat
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work kalau tak kan kalau kau ikut jer it will definitely not work
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun kan kalau kau buat game macam five dorang main ke I mean
ya like okay kalau aku ah nak aim for
apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar like tiga tahun empat tahun ah not not not not tak tahu belajar I mean tak tahu tak tahu buat math like aku bagi dorang game pasal math tapi ah dia nya macam quizzes aku bagi chemistry
lari kan that's why err that target audience is the most important thing when kau buat game macam untuk kau eh best sia game ni ada chemistry tapi kau tak tahu actually your audience is yang orang yang nak belajar pasal math
like iron man okay ni ni ni betul-betul uh off track
ah ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart lah like he might be one of the inspiration where aku will continue programming because
scenario kalau orang betul-betul don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so aku rasa like programming is a
apa eh
that's why aku really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
I mean they will have a controlled environment macam uh dia nya apa tu
apa tu ah udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam this sphere abeh kalau ada ikut macam earth punya udara inside that sphere aku rasa everything should be fine kalau orang kena tanam ke apa there might be a proper grave for them cuma
it's weird lah it it's weird ah cause tak pernah dengar orang ah eh mana kubur kau bukan kau ah mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa oh dekat mars ah aku nak merawat
naik spaceship but that is a possible future also like kalau let's say when elon musk dia cakap uh human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine kalau you have your own spaceship macam kereta sekarang but kau nya spaceship kau imagine macam eh aku nak pergi ah moon jap kau nak makan ah moon burger eh boleh ah kita gi makan sekarang K jap aku ambil spaceship aku
ya abeh kau ah fly ah okay ah ni set ah to moon then dia nya spaceship kau cakap okay uh ten minutes ride okay
abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang Grab pe so kau call uh space Grab
unless bila mars dah ada a way to like
maybe the thought of that like macam aku tahu aku tak mati so buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua you become complacent
then kau complacent then then there's no progress in life lah macam semua dah convenient untuk kau [pe] or aku boleh ah aku boleh tengok anime hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati pe so takyah belajar ah takyah belajar apa takyah mandi cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
makes humanity not to deserve to have a um apa eternal life
but not the things like macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam eh dia ni bagus sia okay dah tu jer ah abeh kalau macam for example kalau michael jackson
dia buat buat lagu semua macam okay lah kalau dia tak mati it's still there ah tapi bila he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because macam oh a legend it has it is a legend because
so imagine if like ah the apa eh
the same goes for ni ah the the the football legend
macam eh dia ada buat aku susah but
ya so okay lah takpe lah eh banyak time ah ni tak banyak time sorry
dekat bilik spare
wait wait wait so he pinjam duit
ah dia put afan name down as macam guarantor kau tahu kind of thing ah
but did he tell him beforehand ke apa
so how long ago was this and berapa
dia punya amount
wait but kinda guy macam like can't he go to a licensed one
but you are initially macam kau okay with that ah actually
dia macam degil kind of guy ya
tak macam masalah dia it is that kind of thinking like
nanti your issues will like snowball
snowball anjing punya
pinjam duit shit
making macam
co-curricular activities kau tahu
but aku aku macam thinking more of on the lines of
macam you ask me to get a guard
macam eh eh eh bodoh you know that kind of thing
kau jangan get rile up ah
okay so the other day aku jumpa dia
oh it's one of those kind I like like like um on the video kadang-kadang
they would ah play macam
okay so dia cakap macam
kalau aku hilmi
then ah he wafan was saying ya but you know the act of macam more or less you're saying
I was wondering kalau
matair jer
so that's the thing I was trying to get across to him ah macam you know I understand where he's coming from sebab
help help that's a fucking understatement kan ya but macam
in a in a very tough spot aku macam put it in a more personal light ah I'm saying that I totally not okay
like would you still hang out with me tak
and then macam cakap
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then dia macam maki sekejap ah
abeh he said that he said that ultimate like pakcik thing to say that ah that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this one pakcik thing but he said the other part pakcik thing
nanti aku tak boleh focus
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay I I would still hang out with you aku masih boleh
lepak dengan kau ah kind of thing
aku macam okay
let's say kau nak main macam devil's advocate kind of thing
so what do you feel about the difference macam in terms of
okay but what do you think of her macam dia punya character and such
okay so I what I don't see where you're coming from ah macam aku faham but I don't think it's matter of gender tau
bodoh gila pe
sama sama situation as us ah
bulgy chonkers juga tau
dia punya their food
kan dorang punya makanan
the portion kan besar gila
tapi there's no incentive too you know
but that one also doesn't paint like err macam compete picture juga cause a lot of the citizens dorang punya baseline is met
okay uh as a brown guy here aku pun free education ah up to a point
we get sidetrack macam anjing
other factors juga
err apa nama dia
so what is it about the home wrecker yang
punya urge to choke slam dia is like rising ah it's
like the underlying issue is still there apa like he's basically not happy
it's a dengki thing ah
but if you see me tons of time aku mana iron anything
no but it's one of those things that it just macam it creeps up on you
sebab ah asian dengan
wait wait ah kau sixty one right
kind of situation aku macam I was eighty six kilo sia
aku used to have an issue about eating ah I don't why like I I was constantly lapar like hungry
but you eat you wake up in the morning kira kan macam
ravenous nak mampus
so macam um I think they were doing like is
macam no no no
aku dah macam yo
is it dah macam you know like
no it's not so much muz ah muz macam
so he was first I said okay but it was that kind of okay macam
suka hati ah you know that kind of thing
ah kind of ya so my sister was complaining a bit and then after that he was finding a a lot of issues pasal
aku pun nak join his side but I cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know I've I've um contemplated about lah some of them macam not a big deal but there are some things that he that as I find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is zakat
dia macam cakap oh it doesn't feel transparent
betul ah that's what fahim adhere
no not my family dinner at simpang kan
ah aku dah
aku dengar tu aku dah macam oo
roma dah stand at attention
so I kau jangan cakap gini ah
macam you cannot expect a marriage now what doesn't make sense right
just the show juga
oh he ajak me again like today's friday but aku macam
oh no no aku have
no it's one of those like coursera kind of shit kau tahu
this makes sense aku aku faham
australia eh tak
and we been friends for berapa tahun
dari twenty fifteen
tu twenty fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen
did you know they say kalau apa ni you been friends for tujuh tahun lebih kan then it's a friend for life so in this one year that's the defining
and that's like nanti we we buat apa ni
macam buat form konon eh aku kasi kau ah nadi you have to sign this form for making sure friends for life
so lagi satu tahun ah
banyak commitment
okay ah jom kita tengok
hmm macam
pada I semua makanan sedap so semua memorable
um kalau satu eh
terduduk right or like if I makan curry cause I tak suka sangat tau makan curry right so kalau makan curry right then confirm sometimes I will think about the bunny chow ah macam mengidam
basically curry dalam roti satu bantal roti sebantal roti
and then curry kat dalam
ya I know I cause like kita order kita nampak gambar tu that's why kita order kan
so tapi macam I think yang kenapa like
tempat the tempat itself
like orang-orang dia semua macam
chill right like dorang nampak kita macam kawan baik padahal tak pernah jumpa and then I think cause also not a lot of people cause it wasn't a meal time
tempat orang tourist kan
terus tak ada orang then kita jer
food adventure day so macam
kita makan tu lepas tu kita gi makan was it a burger
cause also we had no money but kita nak makan banyak
ya nak kena agak-agak
agak-agak lah
oh aku ingat seh aku ingat McDonald's
I remember the McDonald's pasal
aku saja jer keluarkan chili packet um
I ada gambar I think
satu benda tu macam ah roti dalam dia daging
it's like roti prata dalam gulung gulung daging
kari daging or something like that is it
oh ada nasi
macam nasi briyani tapi tu tengah tengah dia cheese eh apa eh
cheese dengan daging ah
ah tu nasi
daging dengan cheese ke something lah putih there right it was a
ya then cause melayu dorang bukan macam melayu kita ah cause their malay is mainly they came from indonesia ya and then
oh I aku tahu err there's something else kita cuba um apa benda tu yang roti
itu jer eh roti yang is also from the malay apa the melayu the cake malay site no remember we went driving like I think on my birthday or something we went driving in that area
so that no it wasn't bo-kaap it was like a different side of cape town and then we drove there specifically for that particular roti
what was the roti called
okay so the roti is like ah roti perancis panjang gitu kan and then after that dia potong setengah lepas tu dia taruk macam you nak taruk daging ke nak taruk ayam
ya but it's like a very very long roti perancis right
sayur right and vegetable
ya then we no we then okay so we had the whole roti perancis and then they asked us whether you want the full you know like Subway like foot long or half right and then we were like ya we want full and then so he was okay so you want two
ah terus kita nak masuk kan ice box pun tak berani
tu lepas tu tak ada microwave
so kita macam
nak buat apa ni eh so I remember satu satu malam kita tinggalkan kat tepi kat atas meja betul tak
uh it was like I think we ate like like for lunch and dinner on that day we ate only half of that roti perancis betul tak
and then the next then the next roti perancis
front that roti we even half it again right so it was like one quarter so we ate the one quarter then the one quarter and another one quarter so it's like four four four meals ya but I think
no it's ya sedap
then the other day I tengok then there's I think someone was also at
the freaking roti perancis
um was we wanted to go to the hill remember kita there was like
hari kedua kan kita dah sampai okay so we sampai kat cape town then we already checked in and everything then the next day
so kita lah macam ghairah kan konon banyak tenaga so kita orang macam okay the next day ya
masih muda that was how many three years ago only
so like the next day we were like okay even though we're jet-lagged kita nak pergi we know tak nak buang masa kita nak terus like jump into all the activities right
so kita pergi
and then the Grab driver was like very nice very friendly talk to us the entire trip okay this was at five or six in the morning can you imagine like we lepas just after we got off and then
ya and then the Grab driver okay so the plan was kita nak panjat itu hill and then after that at the top of the hill then we see the sunrise
right it makes so much sense and people say like to go up the hill it takes like you know half an hour at most so kita macam okay ah boleh ah settle juga ah kan so the then the Grab driver very nice what was his name ah I remember it was something very doug
betul it's like no doug or something doug lah his name I don't know and then and then ya I remember we made a lot of jokes after that no okay anyway so
so the so we told him that we wanted to climb nak tengok sunrise all that and he then he dropped us off at this spot and he said ya a lot of people panjat kat situ they start kat situ then they panjat and then by the time dorang kat atas nampak sunrise so kita macam eh it doesn't look like
the hill or whatever and there's like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so kita okay lah go jer so so kita tak tak pakai benda climbing pun kita pakai jeans kan kita pakai winter coat uh you I remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
tak bersedia langsung we just started and then air pun tak ada I remember
botol air kita ada satu jer botol air right between us there's satu botol air
kasut biasa and then kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gula-gula
you know Daim kan yang chocolate gula-gula something like that
I think there's like berapa gula-gula jer and then after that ya satu botol air okay so we started climbing then masih boleh sempat vlog tau mana video tu pun aku tak tahu pergi
then kita panjat
kita panjat terus dah macam lima belas minit ke dua puluh minit macam masih belum naik eh belum lagi sampai a'ah so kita macam kenapa kenapa macam jauh betul ni ingatkan like all the online say like it's very fast should be okay and then like okay ah
ah puncak dia macam jauh kan
I don't know lah kita dah sampai
go jer ah ikut jer takkan nak stop
a'ah eh tak jauh ah
terus dah dah setengah jam gitu aku ingat kita dua macam dah penat kan terus ada kat ada macam tempat duduk kan then ada bench
then it was like facing the apa the town below so kita macam wah cantik kita pun duduk then kita duduk then kita macam penat terus minum air ah then kita minum air wah macam relax ah konon terus minum air
then by that time also sunrise pun dah naik terus kan kita macam okay don't need see sunrise ah but never mind ah
ya and then I remember kita share gula-gula
apa ni minum air lepas tu dah okay dah nak can continue okay jom continue lagi
continue berapa jam ah dua jam tiga jam dua jam
aku rasa dua jam continue all the way to the top
like seriously siapa panjat all the way tak perasan macam oh go jer
like macam jap jap dah sampai atas gunung
tak like waktu kita tengah panjat pun macam angin dia terlalu kuat kan then the angin
naik kan
ah macam angin dia tengah tolak kita naik so I think that's why kita macam every time kita pass by that part kita macam cepat-cepat naik kan macam go go go go
ya so turns out the hill was like so why the mountain was called lion's head is cause the lion the mountain the the the head it was actually the kepala and then there's signal hill that we wanted to originally to climb was actually the body of this lion
so kita
but the Grab driver didn't see that kita tak pakai baju athletic at all oh okay kita pakai baju lepak nak mampus
oh I remember after when we were going down kan aleh-aleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak so dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini
dengan beg sekolah dengan coat warna biru aku ingat seh coat aku biru macam shiny
your bomber jacket like bright pink bright blue so macam I really going down the mountain like wearing casual clothes and then these mountain people
ya macam
tak puas kan
we all melayu together
you talk all the masjid-masjid
all the masjid
kita ikut macam ada walking tour kan tapi tu kita tak halfway kita macam
kira was cape town itself and then when we went for that safari after the school
the safari so we had so basically lepas kita dah
ya it felt so long right ya like hari-hari ada benda nak buat
weekend kita orang pergi mana
pergi entah lah sekolah bawa gi jalan-jalan kat mana it's like literally weekend trip to a different part of
it was it was very bulgy I think also cause majority of the budak-budak yang ada were budak apa american so like I think they had to up like they wanted to make sure these americans tak complain sangat confirm dorang complain ya
ya so for that after kita dah belajar for the summer programme then we had like this one week plus of safari so kita orang pergi um basically we went up the coast of southern south africa
and then kita ya basically went and look at all
we saw we saw them but like kat reserve like we had to enter a reserve to look at all the wild animals and it's not like a zoo where you know where they are cause you is if you're lucky then you get to see if you're not lucky then you don't get to see
oh there was more than three right four I think empat
sepuluh kot and then macam aku tahu we had to sign up right for the vans and then we had to put our names down for which vans you want to be in
so we sign up we sign up for like the last van cause tak ada orang like no americans wrote their names there I think right so we put names for the last van
ya same tanah air
um ya and then like all the americans already had their cliques and whatever so they dorang taruk nama dorang in the first few vans or whatever you know supposedly it's gonna be like a fun trip for them
and then err at the end of the whole thing we realised yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih mature I would say eh and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we don't really know each other lah sebelum tu when we started the trip
but then by the end of the trip like the vans like the first like the the van yang first first tu semua macam
nanti dorang tak jadi kawan lagi ke apa tau macam at first dorang start off macam ghairah nak mampus macam woo woo woo tapi tu at the end of the
like the whole week dorang macam
macam enemies eh macam tak nak dorang gaduh banyak tak cakap apa-apa padahal untuk van kita
beginning macam
tak kesah all then at the end of the whole thing kita orang macam woo woo woo
berapa one week plus
I remember when kita dah balik he still message me for photo
I'm like ya like okay hantar hantar hantar hantar
so what what did we do kita buat oh we did bungee jumping
oh dia tolak
ya I was like siapa eh I think kaysa eh anyway I was just telling her like
I couldn't see where my legs were I couldn't see where I was going so of course I just raba raba
so instead instead of the muka-muka kawan it's basically
do you want to talk about the food atau makanan atau everyday activity
aku baru nak tanya what's stopping you
no the question was three but never mind I don't tengok we take turns ah
I mean dulu aku pernah
primary school pernah belajar apa inline skating so I'm assuming that it will be similar to ice skating
I feel like I pernah tanya kaysa
ya you know hari tu dorang saja-saja satu keluarga pergi pergi apa ni kat kallang punya eh ice skating sama-sama and then dorang complain budak-budak tu kacau
similar like if you can naik if you can inline skate then you can ice skate that's what she said
right and then if you you know especially why kau tengok kau tengok movie movie kan dorang tengok ah macam pretty women yang baru punya tu eh pretty women pula little women kan
and then they there was a scene where joe and laurie pergi kat lake and then after that they skate
tak hitam ke tak merah tak sunburn
banana boat ke
you tak tahu swim you tak nak mati
it's not it's not like the tarik you that kind
tak ada lah
oh ah memang a'ah
okay tapi tu kalau I if you tahu macam mana nak float kan aku rasa okay jer
kalau macam gitu then okay lah bye bye
asal kan kau tak mati okay jer macam floating is the kau tak mati
jangan apa ni jangan dapat cramps sudah

dia itu macam ini tak err bukan competence tak competence lah dia kata tak bagus lah apa semua memang rude
memang rude kalau baca message dia memang rude
a'ah itu ah macam kan kan sudah tak pernah kerja tempat lain tapi
tak apa lah okay so that one is second
ingat tak waktu bulan tiga apa yang berlaku we need to refund
fifteen K to uh our clients lah because waktu itu ah
project tak dapat jalan and COVID comes and then
actually dia orang nak minta kita bayar dua puluh ribu ah
tapi err we said to them yang kita kan sudah buat kerja sikit so kenapa nak refund full
so dia orang minta refund lima belas ribu then
that one is very tough lah untuk kita semua for her for us as a team and
for others lah juga untuk dia juga lah
and that one is better for her juga lah sebenarnya okay
okay so empat saja boleh tak
terlalu painful lah okay ida tak nak cakap tak nak cerita lima okay
waktu dia susah bukannya waktu kita susah lah okay
balik lah
mm mm cakap saja lah terus terang
okay yang awak rasa macam top lima yang memang awak rasa awak buat keputusan yang betul yang awak betul lah
ya sama
walaupun kita duduk seorang tapi rasanya macam yup yup tapi tak lah memikirkan masalah di rumah
okay that one is the first one sama dengan akak juga second one
okay alright teruskan teruskan
tempat asal lah tempat awak tinggal awak dapat tawaran dekat tempat asal awak lahir okay then
stay tempat yang ada sekarang tempat yang awak belajar lah
err saat rasa macam ada certain soalan macam a bit repeat lah
okay let's say sudah tak ada
apa ah top five things yang you got right is the first one is I made a
bukan lah ada bukan lah make decision pun I terpaksa pun untuk hantar thesis I supaya I dapat viva
nak kena mengasuh dia orang bagi faham lah apa benda lah lepas itu tak faham-faham juga
but then ada staff yang we got it right yang bagus
walaupun macam yang mungkin macam gaji yang kita bagi pun tak ini tapi we promise to her that we might be give you
better later because kita pun tak kaya kan
so kita tak nak lah share kekayaan itu di kalangan kita saja kita mesti nak share dengan orang lain juga
okay so I'm not sure it is the got right ke tak tapi
ah mempertimbangkan lah okay entah lah ada berapa sudah empat kan empat saja lah okay next question
okay akak dulu ah okay risiko terbesar yang akak ambil adalah
macam to from kelas mengaji err class mengaji physical to online fully
and memang struggle ya allah ya rabbi buat facebook live and so on macam gitu kan
tapi we managed to do that lah walaupun struggle
totally memang change and then after that we build um err jauhari
masih dalam progress and hero cilik waktu itu and like then juga shine untuk board game lah
tak ada okay we skip all that question then soalan keenam
what was the smartest decision you made dekat sama kan
okay tak payah lah okay next which three important relationship improved the most family tadi awak cakap lagi
alright okay dua okay so macam akak pun akak the first one is
err ya lah our relationship eh kita tak ada siapa-siapa kita dua orang saja ida okay with my room mate dengan ida
akak rasa akak better sikit dengan ayah akak kot
selama ini akak ada perception yang macam
anggap tak baik apa semua kan tapi bila akak macam bantu dia untuk kerja sekejap
kak kak nampak lah dia usaha dan dia struggle
kak relationship dengan itu lah ah okay okay
ah that guy okay cuma
ya lah macam dulu kan akak ini macam lelaki ini apa teruk ah apa semua kan but right now okay just be understanding lah okay nombor sembilan
dia beri greatest impact dekat ida lah
okay aduh sebab
ya lah sebab tahun ini kan kita jarang masa bersama dia kau orang okay untuk akak
err ada dua lah dua close friend okay err
bukan lah someone yang yang bersama-sama dengan kami sudah dalam business partner
tapi dia tetap seorang sahabat yang ada kadang-kadang sometime bila kita macam
contact dia minta nasihat ke apa ke walaupun saya memang marah lah dekat dia tetap lah orang yang beri impact kepada saya lah okay
first one jadi seorang yang lebih baik atau seorang yang pemarah ada dua kan the second one um
okay second one yang memang sentiasa kalau misal kata okay dia kalau dia ada masalah dia akan call
dia akan call akak tapi dia pun sedia untuk mendengar apa masalah kita
okay then last year is the first one yang akak cerita dengan dia after few years lah sudah berkawan kan
baru lah akak reveal dekat dia siapa yang bagi teratai akak rasa tahun lepas ya that one
akak reveal ah sedangkan orang bagi sudah teratai sejak tahun dua ribu sebelas
ah sudah sembilan tahun sudah waktu itu kawan err apa
yang kawan akak yang sudah ini kan yang sudah yang sudah pindah balik itu
err akak tanya okay okay memandangkan awak sudah tak ada kan okay ada satu benda yang ini nak bagi tahu okay so bagi tahu lah yang akak yang bagi teratai itu okay
um my parents err no I mean not err err macam
err macam sometime not in a good side but somehow
it turns to be a bad side juga okay uh so
greatest impact sebab greatest impact tak tahu apa benda ah okay soalan nombor sepuluh ida
okay ramai itu okay
ya lah family lah kan family mak ayah adik itu saja lah
third spend time the most ini boleh jadi orang yang kita call
yang paling nak akak cakap dengan top first
asnah lah itu tak dapat dinafikan itu memang top first lah
sudah okay next how did those five people influence you wow ambil engkau
yes so dia banyak bagi nasihat and so on lah
okay bagus bagus so itu lah yang paling most impact lah
okay so akak err
influence yang the first one is asnah
dia yang suggest sudah lama sudah dia memang suggest untuk akak pergi jumpa psychiatric
instead of counsellor ah sebab dia tak dia rasa it's not ini lah kan
and then after yang um
akak punya akak go talk dengan doctor doctor itu kan yang akak cakap dengan awak itu
and then after that akak decide memang akak tak nak go for university punya
akak go for memang professional punya field lah
and then um apa macam mana dia apa ini how impactful these five people ini
um tadi parents akak dan juga akak cakap pasal madrasah kan okay so madrasah yang akak pergi ini um
dia orang err most of them are refugees
okay and there is uh ada satu macam episode lah yang mana seorang budak ini dia
ganggu tau lembu dekat kawasan itu
orang kampung lah kata dia nampak okay but then um and then
macam pihak penguasaan madrasah ini macam marah lah and tampar budak itu depan mata akak
so itu akak rasa macam sudah lah you sudah lah dia refugees tahu dia memang
macam itu lah kan macam memang ya lah kita tak tahu negara dia dulu macam mana kan
memang ya lah mungkin dia orang bermasalah tapi dia dia orang adalah kanak-kanak yang ada perasaan
okay so issue nya adalah budak itu duduk tonggeng-tonggeng
punggung dekat orang kampung lah apa semua lepas itu main lepas itu macam
lepas itu err I talk to my dad lah waktu itu kan macam mm
anak ah cucu dia buat benda yang sama tak sama saja so apa
apa beza cucu dengan orang yang dia jaga ini ini kan
sama saja dia orang pun budak juga even err ya lah memang cucu lah umur bawah kecil sikit kan tapi sama saja
uh these refugees kulit hitam ke kenapa kita tak respect dia
okay so that one like yang I rasa err macam lagi kasihan dekat budak-budak semua ini so
these people ini yang give greatest impact to me lah okay soalan nombor sepuluh
who are the five people you spend the bukan ah sudah sudah salah salah nombor dua belas nombor dua belas what were the best five books you read
tapi dia tak ada cakap dua puluh dua puluh tahu dia bagi tahu what were the best five books you read itu saja
err daun tidak membenci angin macam itu ah
dia pasal cerita saja macam itu ah and
buku itu daripada bukan daripada ini lah dia memang negara luar punya
apa uh daun tidak membenci angin macam itu tajuk dia kalau tak silap ah ah okay
buat cerita apa ini dengan activity dengan budak-budak macam itu lah tapi
and ada satu masa itu ah dia punya quote dia macam ini ah
okay kita banyak menyalahkan takdir tapi semua yang jadi ini semua tuhan sudah tahu
even macam daun yang jatuh pun allah atas kan sudah allah kan ah
so benda itu just go with the flow jer okay so the first book
okay ida ada lagi tak buku sambil-sambil tu kita tukar-tukar lah
buku english

ah sepanjang COVID err kak asnah suggest untuk akak baca lah who moved my cheese
ah that one ah dia macam okay
err dia orang dia ada beberapa ini lah beberapa character mm
tikus lah yang mana yang stay
sampai lah cheese itu habis
maksudnya tapi sebelum cheese itu habis lagipun um waktu cheese itu ada dia orang sampai sudah buat rumah apa semua dekat situ
which is these people adalah orang yang cepat settle down
tapi bila cheese sudah habis macam mana kan tempat sudah dekat situ apa semua so macam itu lah
and another one adalah orang yang nampak orang yang tahu cheese ini akan habis
so dia get ready with another another option okay
and daripada dua ekor ini juga dia orang ada yang berpecah satu lagi memang nak stay
berharap yang orang akan hantar lagi cheese dekat situ
cari cheese tapi tak jumpa struggle jatuh terduduk macam nak mati nak macam semua lah
tapi akhirnya dia jumpa cheese
uh tapi tapi after that the fasa yang sangat sangat teruk lah okay
ah itu lah who moved my cheese lah okay lagi ada buku lagi tak baru dua

lepas itu orang yang memang pilih untuk business dan sebagainya dan semuanya silap
a'ah kan tak ada benda yang betul pun tapi asyik dipertikaikan so macam mana kita nak
err apa bangun daripada scars pun dia bagi tahu okay
ada ada fasa yang macam bila akak seorang then ah then a lot of things kan
this world doesn't deserve me ah macam itu ah so
this is the first lah yang I I'm grateful for is I am still alive
that one lah akak punya satu ah akak tak terfikir lagi

okay sudah right
so that this um apa ini
kita punya resolution untuk eh resolution
atas view of orchard tapi err in a budget hotel
I mean okay lah I mean considering dia punya apa tu space and all that is really small but I just think that it's quite macam convenient and comfortable because macam very cosy
ya it's it's really giving me the vibes because macam like you have to walk through the lorong and all that to find the entrance and then along the way you see people
you see like residential and all that lah so macam I actually do feel like as if I'm not in singapore ya although once you step out onto orchard road then you'll be like ah okay
I hate it oh my god macam like betul betul self-conscious sia oh my god will she see my body
nobody's going to stare I mean I know you're not gonna stare kalau like terglare and then you like oh no
ya ya I'm fine with it I mean it's not like we datang selalu kan so
ya then you have to wait lah queue then wait for the aunty to like okay adik berapa orang okay dua orang duduk okay ah
adik also it's not abang okay it's adik cause he's younger than us ya
I also don't know lah but he look I call him adik cause it's just an insult to him can you imagine if it's if you you talk to him ah adik nasi ayam dua I tell you it'll be so insulting
we'll be like adik nasi ayam dua satu tak nak sambal
not being very friendly because we've always had our encounters with uh female punya shopkeeper yang macam fierce and garang right
nak apa dik nak apa huh makan lah dik semua tak nak
ya so macam like oh okay lah maybe he wants to be one of the first few male stall keepers or store owners ya don't have a very friendly approach to their customers
lucky plaza sahaja so I think because you see eh the near nenek atau mak tak tahu lah dia punya atuk ke apa they are actually very friendly people ya so I think that's what
attracted people or to you know to want to keep coming and all that cause dorang tahu macam orh ah nak pakcik ni cute ah macam like dia selalu smiling
and also because if you are working there and it's lunchtime you wouldn't want to like waste so much time talking and then especially kalau queue makanan kau sampai of course you want to cepat-cepat kasi habis pe
you mean angkat ayam merah oh ya
oh yang kat tepi err
mm I mean macam like what I mean is like my brother-in-law
like he he he's on a keto diet he works out and all that tapi ah ya his diabetic punya reading has reduced but his cholesterol level is still high up there so ya it really depends ah I mean yes you lead a healthy lifestyle but certain things you cannot avoid
he did this one going on for a couple of years what it's just that macam he only started yang exercise is much more rigorous because err he goes I mean he eventually found like kaki to you know run and all there and then you know lah people kat sana dorang selalu macam nak
buat apa tu compete siapa lari lagi banyak and all that ya
ya so I don't know how is it like ya but whatever it is there are I mean there are cases whereby orang macam like oh they lead healthy lifestyle but my children turn out to be diabetic that kind of thing so it really depends lah so it's always good to always
uh check whether you punya you know levels okay ke tak
it's very frustrating ah macam like especially for my brother-in-law cause dia dah yes my don't know my blood sugar sugar reading has is now acceptable
cause he's really looking forward to be put back on so boleh naik pangkat
ya exactly but because doctor kata dia ada this certain levels you know that kind of thing so dia tak boleh ambil ah ya so he needs to be macam semua okay so that he can resume taking then lepas tu baru dia boleh considered for uh promotion
mm I mean like you will be wondering lah so I remember macam like on sangat kuruskan badan lah and all that because ya he's stuck there because like macam they said that oh because of your health you know maybe you cannot do a lot of rigorous work so cannot
get promoted macam tu ah
not ya this is going to be a long period lah mana boleh overnight turn kau ni pun
so ya so um I mean I was telling lah maybe you know nutritionist or dietitian you know tell them that okay I nak turunkan my eh my cholesterol level so how do I start off how do I do so
tak lah dia pergi doctor just untuk check dia punya apa tu blood sugar level then cholesterol level is nothing to do with macam like okay so what am I supposed to do next it's just that main pun gila so aku marah dengan kakak
but just tauge because err okay
ya ya that's one thing that I don't really like cause like macam you want to be healthy then okay lor unless you you know it's really your source of income whereby you share with your viewers what you've been doing so that they can learn from there and all that tapi setakat macam nak like show off then ugh
I like apa tu make your own plans lah as
no more like my father is atas not us we're not there yet
apanya yang birch car punya skirt
oh okay okay uh yang baju lengan pendek tu ah okay okay
but now it's available kau tak nak beli
beli satu jer
mm mm it's really about whether or not um you nak better details but you need to take care of the material ataupun
and specifically macam like you do not have menses on that day
four or five pieces of clothing on depends ah sometimes I buy more if there's like available designs then I don't I don't spend for the next six months then I wait macam cause I beli tengah mid year sale atau end year sale
and then I will purposely go bila err towards the end of the sale period I mean I know there's not more there's not many err options for me so I just make do with what's available lah
you know like okay lah boleh pakai pergi kerja boleh pergi mana which explains my poor choices of clothing lately lah it's really makcik makcik bodoh but then
ada ada yang teruk lah aku macam terjujur juga
mm mm no but you must also always set aside something lah like for your self-care and all that tapi it's just with self-care fund that you dah set aside you have to really properly choose your battle lah macam like I nak pergi let's say lah pedi mani mani pedi ke lagi massage ke you know
um hair treatment ke so it's really macam you have to choose one of those macam ya
macam staycay you know that kind of thing with your husband that kind of thing ya tak boleh macam like I nak pergi staycay then lepas tu I nak buat kuku I I nak buat rambut I no no such thing ya
maintain lah bengok
no it's really about macam the people that you you mingle with and all that and whether or not they can actually see the difference because nobody knows or cares like you don't wear the tag outside you know unless you wear a dress that just splash like that kind of thing you know
ya so technically kalau macam begitu
kalau macam begitu lah it really depends actually ya um you what you buy something that you really foresee yourself wearing it a couple of times and you're comfortable with it ya murah tak kesah asalkan okay lah you guna kan
kat ion yes
I mean if don't have also you can always pergi dengan
dengan apa tu yang budak yang baru kena inject kat uh spine cause she was heavy breathing yesterday right
then itu lah naik Grab mm
ya exactly but he can what he can do is just uh call the hospital just to inform and then after that err tell them that I will update again when I'm collecting lah than daripada keep quiet call kena towed away you know we don't want that to happen
why would you not inform the building or the hospital building that you have left a vehicle there bodoh sia
ya but the doctor's not gonna keep checking every single time eh motor ada kat situ tak motor ada kat situ tak
mm mm so ya lah nak kena kena actually call or inform at least just to check
never it's my first time I mean I've heard of it before tapi
no never because I think because of location macam
ya so far so tak tak hairan lah
ya lah that was even later you know that was in october ya so the paling recent pun
ya can you imagine oh my god letak the kids at home I need to get them out
no lah because you have to book in cause you just you just got the vouchers right so you can only book macam only now lah recently sebelum ni tak boleh book in advance
ya ya ya staycay is that one lah that one is a given itu ada book err quite early
tapi macam like
ya lah new year pun expensive lah mana mana expensive seh cause nak step tengok fireworks ah and all that
can you imagine you stay here then kau nampak kat hujung there's fireworks okay ah
eh but if you have new year's eve kat sini then you look out quite nice eh
oh okay okay tahu tahu a'ah tahu tahu okay okay
mahal gila mahal gila I mean dia macam chalet eh ke apa ni
resort lah macam itu
ee boring nya
now just lebih mahal sia
nak beratur still mahal satu malam
ya but at least kau turun pun banyak barang kau boleh buat apa
I mean you can do a lot go jewel walk walk look at the fountain kat sana tengok momok
ya the thing is kadang kala how soon are you even going to set foot out of singapore I mean kalau nak kata kan pulau ubin okay lah eh but you you don't need a passport for that tapi I mean like international-wise
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon ah maybe like macam pertengahan twenty twenty one
I entah lah aku mana tahu
they delayed because err tiba-tiba ada the spike in the number of cases ah
and sketchy sekarang
I think macam I think kat thailand macam tak teruk sangat kau tahu tapi yang teruk would be macam kat um malaysia
because I think number of cases so far yang dorang report kat news thailand macam tak ada jer
mean ada yang tempat rural ke
I mean for him is like we shouldn't have had done more tests right bodoh
ya like you know we have our rights we have our amendments and all that then okay lah kasut kau orang lah I feel like these are the people that shouldn't be getting any err medical attention if they ever get COVID
all over the country oh bagus lah good job
mm mm mm mm tengok jer lah
how sure are you there are the same group of people mungkin tak lah ada tapi segelintir
daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni then you like ah korang minta kena sepak
ya you know that time dekat asia one kan tunjuk dua budak remaja kat dalam train tak pakai mask bodoh betul
that's the thing someone took a picture but then after that I don't know whether any actions were taking they taken by you know the safe distancing ambassador atau the staff and all that
so like I I just feel like kadang-kadang orang singapore ini kan dorang banyak complain banyak ambil gambar banyak submit video when it comes to action it's zero so annoying
ada lah segelintir
no dia kena saman lazarus island pun sama semua kena saman
I feel like you kalau jail yang perempuan yang kata mana tak
ya that one she does it she did it repeatedly kalau you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time tak serik second time tak serik
ya lah but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone lah like got the first time okay kalau kau buat lagi then that's it kau minta kena sepak you know that kind of thing
apa dia we have what
no the thing is adela they have different arrangement adela so macam like offices right now right they said ah cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
okay and then like in my office right they have that macam
kan begini ah seh
khatib khatib kat mana ni
oh kat yishun itu
oh yang ah ya ya I wanted to ask him mana then I I saw HomeTeam
panjat panjat panjat then lepas tu
but ada lah I've been avoiding arrows so much
alah kesian
maybe should just put disclaimer I'm really nice please don't take my niceness wrongly you know macam cerita a walk to remember please don't fall in love with me
oh ya that's true dorang just bengat gila sia
yes ke bedek ah you know like ah
aww awak ambil berat tentang saya ke oh alah comelnya naik nombor boleh ah pergi mampus lah
ku baik salah ku tak baik salah semua adiknya pergi mampus lah
I think no lah maybe just because like I don't know maybe dorang main game and then it's nice to talk and because it's really a place for you to macam vent you know dekat rumah you know that kind of thing
okay jer lah aku dah biasa benda begini
like ya like I even have my favourite buaya at uh
no lah because you know kat malaysia kan ada satu video ni the mum ke the father ask the the child bunyi ayam macam mana bunyi kucing macam mana bunyi itik macam mana
I tak tahu and then bunyi buaya macam mana the bunyi buaya is hi sayang
ya so what I mean my favourite buaya is I have this one player who always use the same line on me every single time we play
so I was like eh buaya favourite I and then he's like hi sayang still bisik-bisik nak tidur kan ah macam mana you tahu
I'll be like pergi mampus boleh ya
uh ya usually do that in the presence of other guys then they'll be like kau yang buaya lah sia
tak tahu lah aku malas layan tu kalau dorang mengamuk tu antara bini dengan dia bukan aku nya pasal
alah kesian
kan you main game lah belajar lah main game
I mean nak kena ada schedule lah like okay my previous clan right err
they they are they are they are all muslim married and they have children and all that so what they do is uh they they actually actually agreed with their wife tahu macam okay I will settle everything I will take care of the kids you know homework and all that but then I will play I will have my playing time from nine thirty onwards
is is is is surprising because you know why pasal mereka berbual dalam telephone kan eh dalam game okay abang dah habis ngaji bang okay sekarang barang simpan dalam beg lepas tu balik bilik tidur eh
adik adik macam mana adik homework dah habis ke dik okay kalau dah habis tu kalau tak buat kasi habis dah habis nanti abah check nanti adik boleh tidur
so it's normal lah I mean like there are people who can actually like set aside time you know err really manage time and all that tapi ada tak tahu lah yang macam bengap semacam
I mean like there are a few macam like shirk responsibility sanggup balik rumah lambat and all that pasal nak main game kat luar
tak tahu mana aku tahu but long time never play with the person so I also don't know what happen to him
ya I already at that point of time I thought dia belum kahwin tahu because uh my that time my friend was like kau dekat rumah bujang uh uh then I was like rumah bujang then after that I ask my friend then I said rumah bujang tu apa dia kata macam like you know like basically is what they mean like for us is void deck tapi dorang mana rumah flat kat situ kan so is macam like those
pondok-pondok like kosong like people rest
mm mm macam itu lah along the road ada satu err so that's what they call rumah bujang lah
tak tak tepi road lah tapi ah correct ya ya correct ah ah ah lah sial
then aku aku macam cause nanti dia macam like okay aku nak balik
eh kat mana ni sekarang
eh lawa kat rumah bujang ni then I was like that's when like I was I was like asking my friend after he left the group ah the lobby right
dia tanya kau orang eh
uh rumah bujang tu apa rumah tempat dorang lepak-lepaknya you know macam like macam like okay rumah dia tak boleh lepak ke and then he's like tak tahu lah you tanya dia sendiri
ya and then that time I managed to ask the person lah I said asal kau tak main kat rumah sendiri err dia kata kat rumah dia punya internet tak bagus pasal kat dia nya rumah dekat-dekat dengan hutan-hutan situ
fair enough because like macam awak that time even like normal phone reception
was really bad because it's really near the hutan
ya so I'm like okay lah fair enough lah desak kau kau buat apa kau nak
ya lah data pun tak boleh
ya it's just cause it's really because of reception so-called research tak bagus data pun tak bagus
actually right I think it's just the telco problem because like my friend's kat itself like the area itself is not that highland it's quite macam low to medium right depending ah
so ya so I think it's just the country telcos lah lepas alah
kan macam kat atas bukit pun boleh kau ambil
ya ya I do that tapi nak kena ada portable charger lah or maybe mm mm mm
tapi kalau macam like err either a portable charger then I can play for awhile and then after that charge my phone like for a while
mm mm betul betul
it's literally macam cucuk selah
apa pasal aku berdarah sia kat bawah
like I feel like I fell like macam I be right again
so macam lepas tu aku pergi toilet kan I kencing lepas tu aku tengok ada darah I was like
takut bilang kau that time
akunya akunya benda baik balik bodoh
is because it's really macam masuk then dia pakai macam clamp sakit bodoh
kau belum kena lagi kan berbual banyak huh
they do put the benda macam gel like cold gel or warm gel don't remember at your your area there
no it's very fast it's not even five minutes it's lesser than that cuma like the initial part a bit painful lah
you know it think about it it's for your health so you just do it it's very fast the cepat and you get the result on the spot also
ah kalau ada fibroid ke tak so buat buat sekali lah and then
I know but the thing is my mum also was in pain and then she was like macam like she let up a yelp right and then after that I'm like begini sudah beranak dua no I said no I said I said dah beranak dua kali pun nak bising and then when I kena
okay no she wasn't there right so when I told her sakit baru kau tahu macam sakit she's like
I don't know why but she's always been waiting to use that line on her children like I still remember that time when my sister first give birth and she was complaining to my mum like sakitnya badan berapa sakitnya then she's like baru kau tahu macam mana sakitnya beranakan

unless ada orang tolong jagakan anak dia lah
mmhmm lepas beranak ah mm mm
macam like sexual education but not about abstaining like I think that abstaining not aduh what is not a question anymore you know cause like they're doing it at a very young age I think it's more about macam how to have sex responsibly or safely

then dia bawa like bakul of makanan
ya but aku rasa kau punya kereta boleh ah sebab besar seh
kan habis kau just bawa kau punya
kau punya laptop then kita tengok netflix
wah shiok sia habis kau bawa cushion
ah someone actually ajak me to watch train to busan but then out of nowhere tak update
um tak ada slot then after aku macam okay lah sedih
then dia tak update macam okay ada place you know
then you know and then after that dia keluar dengan abang dia
kan banyak orang sia nak tengok like most of kawan aku semua nak tengok then aku macam
tengok ah siapa first come first serve dulu ah tanya aku
but then end up najrah tak update aku then aku macam okay tak apa lah
ada train to busan kat netflix tak
oh my god you should watch your name dekat anime
ya it's damn fun like it's damn sedih like serious like you will cry like legit cry cry
sebab aku tengok dua kali kan dua kali aku nangis tau
huda said it's damn good so I think you should watch ah aku
akan tengok after my english shows so ya I got a lot of shows ah to catch up on
eh fah jap kau cuba bau yang dia orang bagi yang virus shut out itu
you tengok apa bau
mm bau kau nampak yang benda warna biru dekat atas table tadi
oh maybe on top of your table tak ada kot but just now yang table kita ada
kau tahu oh wait
so um kau tahu aku kan
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either kau buka computer then like
Zoom semua kau akan berbual with your cikgu kan
tapi aku punya kan it's like we talk
apa inner soul kau
okay you kau guess apa aku choose
no oh my god okay correct answer but aku chose orange
aku cakap like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange kan so aku cakap ah like um
aku chose orange sebab it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me ah macam dia can make my soul like very calming
ya so aku macam okay ah then end up aku dapat five points
I want to be stewardess but then end end up aku pakai hijab so like cannot
kawan aku eh no huda's sister yashira dia
ya tapi dia sudah quit sudah
she oh cause aku cakap dengan dia like aku nak jadi air stewardess
then she said like go ah like try but then aku cakap like
cause I'm using hijab what so it's hard
then dia cakap she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after bila touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know macam
macam it's so pelik like ya but I really want sia
ya that's why tapi macam
the thing is kan kalau kau eh
kalau kau on the way kerja that means kau tak pakai tudung
so I think kalau kau sudah fly bangkok or something then
bila kau sudah sampai hotel kau nak keluar balik then kau pakai tudung
so kau imagine kalau like kau punya kawan macam
they say like eh just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume what eh you use tudung you know
like macam back to back
but kau pergi bangkok bila
mm aku
for temperature screener dia dekat bukit batok hospital
so dia orang cakap it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital tapi tak ada aircon
kan pelik dia cakap like note kan dia cakap below like for the note they said um
tak ada aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
so pada aku macam hospital apa tak akan tak ada aircon
I never apply aku just nampak sahaja then aku macam
lah aircon tak ada biar like I don't want like I want I need
that time kan aku dapat okay someone I got
okay not dapat like they replied to me
so aku tanya like hi is this work still available
then kan end up orang itu cakap ya okay still have available
tapi the thing eh it's so annoying like dia orang cakap ada available
then dia orang suruh aku send resume but then they don't reply to it
so aku pergi double text like okay I was being annoying tapi aku need a job
and dia orang sudah cakap aku it's available so aku cakap
um hi excuse me like so is the job still available aku double text tau
err dia cakap hi yes err dia cakap hi yes sorry like still have
then dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja
um dekat heat tak sebab dia macam open space
so the the open space macam kot you know the security guard guard post
aku sudah aku cakap okay ya sure like whatever lah I just need the money
then end up orang itu cakap
so sudah aku sudah cakap yes I'm okay tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya like
are you sure you're okay so aku macam okay whatever
so aku cakap mm
so aku rasa dia annoyed macam bila aku macam tanya like kalau ada aircon ke ada fan then dia tak reply aku sia
tak akan whoever kerja sana macam just mati kan dengan heat dia
eh kau tahu aku tak dapat seh yang that kids club punya
merepek seh
what if what if all of aku punya
month is aku tak hardworking it's just macam nak tak nak
teman you
so kalau
kalau haikal dia masuk kau okay
kau excited sebab kau tak payah layan dia
I mean it depends sebab kan
um most of the time is quite lepak
like tengok section kau ah like macam
most of the time like they will only do like macam the important stuff
so kalau
cause zeko brother masuk kan most of the time dia
banyak free time
quite susah lah sebab they have to
but then lama-lama it's quite okay
it's the part yang after itu yang busy gila
he have to think about it lor like you know lagi dia sudah family strict
kau boleh imagine tak kalau ada family strict
then kalau after dia book out dia nak jumpa kau macam mana eh
mak aku finally okay not finally lah
mak aku sudah tahu yang aku sudah patah balik dengan zeko
um okay kau tahu yang the five hundred grant that singapore bagi kita tu
okay so actually kan zeko dapat
but then he have to give back sebab dia
okay itu zeko dia pergi bilang aisha like macam kau tahu macam member seh kau just bilang like about our problems
then after that itu tak apa then zeko sudah bayar like two days after yang dia dapat that notice
then after that kan mak aku cakap dengan aku
um okay cause we were talking about friends lah like aku cakap dengan mak aku
ma like why you like very macam
aku tak tahu like for me and sarah like we realize mak aku macam tutup one eye for aisha
and it's like annoying macam
okay whenever like we balik lambat okay so that time aku balik lambat like aku balik
before one habis aisha like my mum called me a lot of times ah oh yang kau tahu yang
yang aku aku ambil gambar dengan zeko yang kita side by side
ya so that day right my mum dapat tahu my mum called me like around ten
she said err where are you so I said lah like I'm at newton then she said err awak keluar dengan lelaki kan then I was like
err ya cause aku sudah malas macam err tak lah tak lah gitu so aku cakap ah ya why then she said okay jangan balik lambat
so cakap okay lah then aku text sarah aku cakap
how mama know I went out with zeko then she said
sometimes aku tak bilang apa like aku aku tak bagi nama
so aku macam okay whatever lah aku malas nak fikir
so aku sudah mak aku asyik call like around twelve like macam pukul berapa nak balik pukul berapa nak balik
so after that aku sudah sampai rumah like around twelve fifteen then mak aku asyik call then aku bingit
then aku saat masuk rumah aku cakap ah relax lah like it's only
eh like you said our curfew is one but then kau call aku
pukul dua belas semua like pukul berapa nak balik like it's so annoying then aku balik aku cakap
um yang si aisha mana like dia sudah balik ke belum pergi ah call dia
then after that mak aku macam ya lah nak call dia sekarang
then ah then aku macam okay ah whatever then aku bilang sarah like
ya aku sot but then I think it was like my tone
bila aku balik rumah then because it was so annoying so after that saat um
after like five minutes or ten minutes later aisha balik
then aisha pergi masuk bilik dulu ah so aku kat luar so obviously aisha macam nak gossip gossip
um dia pergi bilang sarah
cakap um pasal mariam ah um mama cakap mariam biadap
itu pasal aku kena balik siang then sarah cakap
err apa yang kau merepek eh like curfew memang pukul satu apa yang kau nak salahkan mariam
which is true ah like apasal kau macam
cakap oh it's mariam fault now I have to go home
padahal just because I was rude like macam kau tahu curfew pukul satu like
kau fikir kau special sangat like you know macam boleh balik like any time
like mak aku tak cakap apa-apa pun mak aku just text dia cakap pukul berapa nak balik then mak aku cakap err adik beradik kau sudah ikut kau
err sudah biadap balik lambat semua then itu pasal aisha nak kena balik
so but then aisha was like blaming me then aku macam like
oh ya then mak aku cakap tak lah like err aisha kan
macam okay so aisha's friend right is like macam
so aisha cakap like um eh mak aku cakap aisha punya kawan
um macam family tak ada family support that kind
so kita macam oh okay lah then mak aku cakap dengan aku err so yam kalau awak nak cari
kawan make sure yang baik-baik semua then after that mak aku cakap
so awak err zeko dia sudah bayar yang duit government
so aku dengan sarah macam tengok each other kita macam
like how you know then kita tanya mak aku ah how mama know
then she said ada lah mama ada spy
so aku sudah sot like I was damn pissed off lah I was like
ya then after that at first aku sudah bilang sarah aku cakap oh zeko kena bayar balik that five hundred
then after that sarah macam oh okay then after that out of nowhere mak aku tahu
then um dia cakap ah confirm aisha bilang
then mak aku cakap tak lah um mama tahu jer gitu like mama dengar so aku macam
uh huh padan muka dia like kan mama punya mulut sudah err masam eh masin
mm ah kan mama punya mulut masin like I already told her to not balik lambat or like
then bila aku sudah keluar semua err aisha texted me she said
err I kena fined blah blah blah then I was like
um huh no lah mama kan ada spy you ask her lah
that you told mama about it then aku cakap um
tak then aku macam aku cakap tak bagus fitnah like anyhow only aku cakap gitu then dia cakap whatever lah
um apasal like mariam nak kena expose aku like
habis sarah pergi reply dia cakap
then after that aisha cakap ah like um like I don't know she was just like saving her own ass
then after that betul pe like story itu is zeko's story tapi apasal kau pergi bilang mama
habis sarah cakap kau fikir mariam nak sit back
err habis like just see like you talking about the boyfriend's name to mama like you know
then aisha say oh gitu then aku macam
like you get what mean macam I'm not saving anyone's ass but it's just that
and and one thing I don't like about aisha kan dia macam
like one time she macam she balik the she said um
apa tu oh she went out to eat with haziq like one of her friends ah yang pernah suka dia
then after dia cakap oh haziq sekarang bawa motor ini ini ini then dia cakap tapi dia nak tukar like kau tahu macam
like mama don't care like who asked like no one asked about like you just tak ada topic and talked about it you know
like pada aku macam huh tak ada orang tak ada orang start topic pun like pasal ini like who asked
then err satu kali oh tadi aku gaduh dengan aisha
tadi I mean through text lah
then the tempat
apa eh
the tempat the kau tahu yang shoelace habis tempat um atas ni kalau
converse kan nanti kalau flip that thingy nanti ada yang the converse punya name kan
ya so she put like that so aku nampak
then okay first dia tak tanya aku permission tau
dia tak tanya aku permission untuk pakai kasut itu like out of nowhere aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak
then after that aku text dia aku cakap one more time if I see my shoes like this
sebab dia punya nike kan she's very protective of it
so aku macam okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's mahal
then after that err dia cakap
err dia cakap I was airing it lah habis dia cakap
dia pergi bilang kat sarah dia cakap why mariam so rude then pada aku macam it's basic what it's kasut birthday aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau ah
habis after dia cakap dengan aku err okay lah so from now
err you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so pada aku macam
the least you can say is sorry what like at least aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap sarah like
um aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta permission like bag dia kenapa macam aku sudah make it aku sudah minta kau permission it's just that kau macam tak acknowledge it you know
then aku macam ah whatever lah then err dia cakap dengan sarah I want to buy shoes so like
err mariam don't have to like nag then aku macam I won't nag if you don't
then out of no where suddenly the next day dia pakai then ada kotor lagi like do you know how pissed I was like
aku baru cuci like sudah bersih habis like kau pergi pakai
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use lah but then end up kau nak pakai aku punya yang
dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang lah aku boleh beli habis pergi lah beli like you know macam it's so annoying like
annoying satu kali itu yang like these few days like we've been like macam
um how to say ah like macam
ya like macam these past few days ah like me and aisha we have like this tension then sarah satu kali
oo I sense tension then aku macam ha lah kau just stop
confirm nanti balik kan dia akan cakap aku err pergi buka beg sekolah aku cause that time I use her bag
but then aku still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
she won't ask permission for her macam oh kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur so like aku sudah tanya sudah
macam what what common sense is that like I don't get it
aku penat sia rant pasal dia
far lah it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just terjauh
tapi that time aku pakai kasut
um merry eh kasut apa tu doctor mart
aku just tak boleh fit aku boleh fit but it's so ketat like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok tau dia pakai macam just
ya tapi sarah punya is not my size so bila aku pakai it's like extra ketat and like pain
but then kalau aku lose the macam the strap dekat belakang kan then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my kaki will ternaik
malas nak go through ah the blister blister
aku punya kasut yang doctor mart yang high cut dulu itu kan tapi dia swee swee jer seh
a'ah macam since
dulu bila aku pakai like okay dia macam
swee swee tapi like there's a little bit of space tapi sekarang sudah swee swee so like
aku cannot use thick socks I have to use like
aku just tak nak like kaki aku blister
berapa banyak doc mart ah kau ada
don't lie sometimes your simple is like aku pakai lepak then end up macam dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
macam rare occasion
oh if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower baju
the ones that you always use the high waisted yang flair
yang macam boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
ya I think that one can match my baju because
okay I have to bring that baju to you sebab dia kat bawah um tali tau
so kalau aku pakai kan kalau aku pakai like normal jeans kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik
ya dia bukan skinny dia um flare yang macam boyfriend's jeans kind
ya because that baju since that time seh my mum buy but then I haven't use yet cause I cannot find like the correct
but then kau tahu aku perasan kan like macam
being with someone like so long macam until like they say like
eh baju you boleh nampak dalam kan baju you boleh nampak dalam kan
sekarang bila aku check baju kan aku really see macam
a'ah lah like really can nampak like okay dulu kalau aku nampak macam singlet kan
okay even though aku pakai singlet tapi boleh nampak the singlet punya shape kan
okay dulu aku macam okay whatever like just use it but then sekarang aku macam
no don't want macam aku feel macam no lah orang like kau tahu sun ah kalau sunlight kan nampak obvious kan then aku macam tak apa ah like
boleh nampak sia like um inner aku like singlet like lagi macam memalukan
ni sekarang like he don't even have to say anything about it aku macam automatic sia
tapi sekarang macam kalau aku pakai button then kalau button itu punya macam you know sometimes the button like too
err macam how to say ah like very far from each other so like
can see the dalam kan
sometimes sekarang aku macam even though aku malas nak pakai
like singlet aku akan just pakai err what ah what's that
the sports bra tapi yang sports bra loose so bila aku pakai at least dia tutup yang kat atas
cause one one time kan aku punya button kan dia
dia very far and aku tak perasan then boleh nampak sia kat aku punya dalam
just hal then aku have to change like my hijab
tapi itu nasib tak ada zeko sia kalau tak dia sudah macam cakap ah siapa suruh pakai baju ni
it's true because if you don't have strict parents right like your parents don't care like if you've matair
ya but then kau
the problem is about kau orang kau orang punya time and like macam parents dia pun quite strict
about matair
if tak strict aku rasa most of the time dia sudah ajak kau sudah datang like
relax kau tahu lagi semalam aku pergi rumah zeko aku masakkan dia
tak cause aku aku sudah masak kat rumah aku
so for yesterday so aku macam okay ah like nevermind aku datang rumah kau
so aku supposed to bawa the food like we can eat together like kat rumah dia
then end up mizi pergi habiskan the rice that aku masak
then aku macam ah shit it's okay then sudah sampai rumah dia
aku tanya dia sudah makan dia cakap belum dia makan cheese cake
then aku tanya ah like err do you have all those ingredients that I can
so mak dia tak ada kat rumah so aku call mak dia aku suka like where do you keep all those like
stuff lah the sayur-sayur all that shit
then mak dia cakap kan okay kat fridge blah blah blah then okay sudah cari semua then aku masakkan dia
different sebab aku pakai for my house right I use cube
a'ah kau tahu macam the tom yum cube all those shit
but then zeko punya kan kita tak ada cube dekat U star
so kita pakai serbuk yang powder
so aku macam okay ah hopefully it's nice ah then
end up okay lah quite nice it's quite pedas
but okay then aku bilang sarah err kalau aku pakai serbuk
tapi aku tak pakai cube okay tak then dia cakap
kau nak masak kat mana then dia cakap are you cooking at zeko's house then aku macam ya
habis dia ketawa dia cakap kau tak tahu malu seh then aku cakap ah like
then sarah say tak tahu malu then aku cakap like is it wrong
ya but then macam pada sarah macam why like why are you doing this then aku macam what like
okay nanti aku akan masak lah
it's so senang kau nak aku masak kat rumah aku ke aku masak kat rumah engkau
eh actually rumah aku lah it's so senang
ya aku aku sudah split duit dengan kakak aku then aku macam how much should I bring then aku cakap okay ah about ten jer

tak tahu dia orang suruh buka radio

at first I didn't want to tell my mom tau because I scared like dia macam skeptical about this thing and then I was like ah ya this is jian wing ini dari like telegram ada like
this macam channel of jobs itu semua and then she didn't reply
then you tak cakap apa-apa
at first I was like senangnya kerjanya like it's easy for like eighteen dollars per hour seh
I am contemplating whether to masuk dikir barat atau like err I don't know if anyone can added like this
itu macam something got to do with like choir the thing tapi it's not really choir but like macam
ya macam nyanyian ada yang menguar I don't know whether I want to nyanyi or not but I don't know where to find barat
like dia macam ah like
actually dia ada ada ah piano punya tau it say like uh I think is piano assemble carpenter and then I don't know if I if I want to masuk do I need to have like a piano punya experience or what atau I can just start from scratch
uh uh mestinya
I didn't know that ngee ann also got dikir barat
ya ke I don't know I thought was only like
have islam ni ke malay
bagus lah
esok err awak masuk see mostly
you know for the for the person you tak boleh
like honestly honesly speaking I don't mind leaving my parents gitu
mm baloi
your course boleh pergi which uni
but the thing is that like like for example macam hari raya if we cannot go back then a bit sad lah mm
no one in my family have gone to like belajar overseas before so like if I'm the first one to go it's gonna be freaking hectic at the airport
but still right one whole army datang sia confirm dia
can you imagine they everyday confirm everyday mesti kena video call like at least once confirm
but I feel that it's okay if if if the school like provide it feel like a dorm atau apartment like if you if you live in the dorm I think it's okay I think it's ya I think that one can like save a bit of money
but like you know you you have to know how to like behave yourself there are like you cannot be iman kau mesti kuat punya like your your spiritual self must be strong ya
like you me and iffa pergi at the same uni but different course I don't mind though right ya
iffa boleh iffa boleh masak actually
bico boleh buat kerja rumah macam vacuum jer she laju
okay aku tak suka suka baju ah aku tak suka basuh baju
oh jemur kain aku suka cuci baju jemur baju angkat baju suka lipat jer tak suka
pasal right lipat baju kan like I don't know like you have to be station there macam if if for example okay like you say you can tengok youtube and stuff right but I cannot I cannot concentrate kadang-kadang
like a suitable time that I want to lipat baju if like someone asked me to do it right I won't do it like I wouldn't have the mood to do it
oh but if like someone like macam tak suruh and then I just like you know voluntarily do it lah finally
oh you have you read about the news yang pasal yang yang orchard killing tu yang orchard tower well what do you feel about that
I I don't like I don't wanna be like racist ke apa lah but like is the fact like if let's say like kalau um our race yang buat
confirm kena punya kan like lebih rabak but I don't know lah I don't know what was the judge or the court was thinking
just just now I told my like I told my sister lah ya every time I see like the news like cakap pasal
I feel like okay lah like how many is is okay but then it reality actually is like quite serious eh like for example like if I'm in that person shouldn't like macam
like confirm it's a bit like severe pe kan the symptoms and everything and like for me to feel like all takde apa-apa lah like that kind of thing it's like a bit worrying though because I selalu nampak and then like you feel like macam day by day your
feeling towards it macam dah apa-apa jer lah
no I think one of the reason why it was because of the election yang kat sabah
fool ya dia lelaki actually know what to say
ya he said that he said that then I'm like like no even like ah is is not even two week tau and he already said that he dah he he baik already from COVID nineteen I'm like apa seh
no the thing the thing about you is that you still ada kind of like ada income from your small business honestly ya
ya like three more minutes just if I miss up then just aduh aku tak tutup pintu that's why
kalau aku giveaway
to think and then like accessories pun boleh pe
yang biasa-biasa jer lah
err sadly due to the circuit breaker the the zoo closed down jadi terpaksa cari tempat lain lah nak kerja tau err
but err I would say the experience there is err pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of macam tourists
I feel macam the camaraderie is is very ya
true lah I mean then again stung lah so people will want avoid tempat-tempat yang crowded lah ramai orang kan susah apa
oh then you quit lepas tu after that few week
so like macam freshie ah
tak payah lah tak payah
oh they approve of your ni lah
you must be worth it lah you kerja keras for a bit only then you graduate with two majors bro everyone wants you man
true lah true lah there's a lot of ya there's a lot of work lah you want to jaga both double major and your part time job it's too much ah even I will crazy man
ah ya hal ehwal masing-masing lah
are you taking of err joining any macam like the malay atau join silat ke silat
macam banyak of my friends lah yang from my err secondary school
all of us decided to join silat together lah
since uh dah rapat kan and then we understand each other
ya then lebih baik lah better for us lah
ya but macam not really official lah I I had to give up the role kepada yang
my best friend yang I feel that it's more suitable lah cause I busy lah with work
kerja then I need to jaga my nenek and atuk
ah speaking of that err about family kan how how are you err ayah and mama
dia orang okay lah
aiyo dia masih belajar situ lah alamak
so macam like err kirakan dia punya pelajaran is a bit uh staggered behind lah is it
but but the your your brother is a genius lah budak pandai kan so shouldn't be an issue lah for him
ya ya my err yang paling kecil lah she taking O level this year
she seems pretty ready I guess sebab dia macam revise lah at home
she err staying up like lewat malam just to macam she catch up on her revision
err nasihat nasihat yang baik lah orang katakan lah ya
ya as suri teladan lah to her
ya her birthday is coming though so I'm pretty excited to celebrate dia punya hari jadi ya
err bulan depan I think early early early august ya
your dad's birthday is coming also right in two months dua bulan from now
ah boleh celebrate sama sama ah macam gitu ah
cause she's been applying for kerja kerja yang macam full time dekat ah those art companies lah last I heard is the teaching lah
she might err ajar budak secondary school so she went
ya ya she's up sebagai our best lah ya the prestige programme lah in our school you know junior college ya
ya she tried lah so now tunggu result jer lah see what the says if if approve then she gets into lah if not
you need two to three minggu from now
ya I feel super disappointed ah I mean kalau tak I already had plans or to travel around europe lah
and then catch the the swiss alps but macam biasa lah people wouldn't think lor
and ya and err on the bright side also nasib baik lah cause I save a lot of money I mean the money I can use it to beli rumah ke
ya oh ya then ah how's your your dad's ah youtube channel ada masa upload upload videos tak
ya betul
so you expect the baby to appear at eh appear eh they expect for the baby to be born lah in err dalam late november begitu
ya all of us are pretty excited lah kita even macam dah buat a baby shower um eh not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone punya spirits lah given ya this macam hard
ya and I and my kakak wen is the
anak pertama lah to carry a child for the family
so ya my my mother and my uh brother-in-law punya mother both of them plan out lah the this party for us
so harap harap err it's going to be fun err it's gonna happen I think ah early next month also
ya her mother will masak makanan for us and then after that my mum will plan out dia punya games and
err aktiviti-aktiviti lah yang kita akan buat on that day itself
the government punya pantang larang kan mesti ikut
kita respect respectable lah
eh jangan lah
malu lah
because she can still err go to work lah but her macam orang atas don't want her to come
because he works at the port right so he helps err he is a I think I think he's an engineer then dia tolong macam pasang lah kalau ada any macam equipment yang rosak
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he macam gembira ah like wow finally he get a job ah
err ah school err apa tu yuran ya yuran sekolah unlike us lah for for
then dia orang tayangkan the whole thing on err facebook live
so they will be like oh ah school of engineering dekat bawah jer nama-nama dia punya students ya in that slow
so in that zoom session dia orang ada buat macam lucky draw lah so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods err jabra elite mostly macam those school technology gadgets lah
ya dia lagi sikit menang seh she said err she said err the one that wins ya it's usually like either dua ke atas dua ke bawah so
I actually ordered err ice cream untuk dia so like
ya then kat rumah I think got no one so uh ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure lah cause the number is
ah the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her lah but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that dia balik sebelum
so mana tahu ah got nasib ah time tujuh then baru hantar
sudah macam one package already
to macam give her I I heard they give her like cremeway alright for her to munch cause of her support for you
aku tahu semua ni ya
that's very nice okay oh it's a chinese girl I I I I forgot I thought it was a I've I've always thought that it will be macam err mixed girl lah
oh really I tak perasan
oh so she's also in our university juga lah
oh she any idea which err kursus she admit in our school
oh wee kim wee is a oh jangan bilang you take double major because of her go wee kim wee
you jangan main-main ni ah
ya pretty surprising eh terkejut I you know
faham lah faham lah
so that macam so far takde macam concrete plans lah with a it's just like you guys
ya lah nanti orang cakap apa kan kalau kita iya lah terlalu excited all then
dude I really want to I really want to but susah lah ni
probably satu dua jam then after that you have to sleep because your work in the next day and
paiseh sangat
jadi kalau awak macam interested kan you can actually join us lah because we just need one more one more person to play the lead guitar we have nadia on the
and then we have err loofy on the keyboard and I'll be paying the drums so we just need someone to fit in the role as pemain guitar lah for us so do you uh interested
uh this is sometime next week dalam hari either jumaat atau sabtu
tengok ah loofy macam mana ah loofy dia memang kadang-kadang suka main-main ah dia macam tak tak serious ya
ya that time dia ni dia dia kerja dekat challenger juga for one day
then after that he I think he fought with his manager that's why he had it lah cause I think the manager kind of bully him also but given he's aggressive nature kan so he macam he quit on the very day also lah
he quit lah I mean ya it they kind of buang him lah he even though he is as as as aggressive as he gets dia punya orang baik sebenarnya
he was the top scorer lah for our class though I don't know ah for A level surprisingly dia punya result didn't reflect
so macam a bit hampa and disappointment
err ya we doing before solat
then after that we pergi solat sama-sama
oh ya ya ya me and loofy kita orang dah apply dah earlier earlier beforehand we apply already
but usually dia punya slot usually cepat ambil lah pasal dia pakcik-pakcik semua dia orang always wants slots right
ah usually the tingkat satu ah closer to the imam
oh no no no no no err now now the wuduk you take from home ah then
ya they they close off the matikan all the air lah
ya tu lah kita orang tak nak banyak interaction lah with other so we keep it at the minimal lah
but who knows you might fist bump juga in the masjid also lah maybe I mean
mm but this is all purely just speculation lah ya bukan betul kan
mm so makan biasa-biasa jer lah like mee rebus dengan mee soto
wow nasi sambal goreng bang dia punya rendang apa
kau kena try bro
tak tak tak sempat because I bangun like just nice at the ninety four minutes mah
then just nice lah so like I terbangun then like oh my god dah pukul lima eh so the next thing I do was I ambil wuduk then I prepare for subuh lah
so ya cik jamal
ya he was lah but he he don't want to macam made me conform to any err beliefs lah
ya it's like he wants me to have the freedom to choose apa team yang I nak support
understandable lah dia orang dekat kan
boleh masuk champions league ya
oh jauh sangat lah
sean jadi millionaire
so any message you want me to hantarkan sampaikan kepada mister havi
I think tiga puluh tahun kan and I think
he's been waiting for this lah dah lama seh he tunggu go their win right
so he really it really bucks him lah when they don't don't win a match or dia orang tak tak uh perform as well as he nak dia orang to perform lah
my as a firefighter ya and kita dulu masuk the station together together
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy ah kat yishun situ
the daerah canberra
meanwhile they told us in training is lain what from what you are going experience real life
oh oh so so you so you were like macam patrolman lah gitu ronda-ronda around the area
wah they are not worrying ah like you I mean do you get calls often or macam takde masalah ke in the area
oh err I mean like since you are posted in a the area macam tak ramai orang kan so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
macam tak pressure lah orang tak I don't feel macam orang bully you or anything
ah dia orang macam
hibur-hiburkan lah so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
oh lari-lari anak around area
but but usually berapa jauh you run
macam the only only time I ran jauh gitu is back when I was in serving my lah they make us run around ubin
and I think that's the way lah macam orang tak tahu you cannot drink a lot kalau nak minum sikit jer kalau boleh jangan minum at all
uh habis
thirty minutes baru jer minum that that's the ideology that
ah macam
ya it's about biology larh and then oh ada mention yang if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
ya it it can be that and also you didn't ni lah um ah wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so kita tak boleh kita tak boleh push too much lah nanti orang cakap kan
but ya berapa banyak juice you suka minum in one day selalu
okay true lah because like for me macam I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks kan macam air air air yang sweet ni semua
boleh mendatangkan kencing manis so
ya so uh at home pun I only got air masak
jadi most of the time the only ah the best alternative would definitely be juices ah
oh no I don't like to buy all these macam manufactured punya cause I feel macam dia tak mendatangkan any
apa tu benefit lah so I selalu beli pergi pasar then I beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan
ah biji biji buah-buahan then I balik I potong I blend
then I letak air then I minum ah
it's right way ya my ni if you if you if you if you got the time my ni always recommend lah when you blend kan you blend dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali
ah dengan kulit-kulit dia but the biji the biji you take out
okay lah the kulit err
oh ya ya ya apa dia apa I heard some fruits eh if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good lah jadi kena macam pandai-pandai lah
ya oh eh grapefruit dengan grape is lain eh tak sama eh
grapefruit dengan grape dia orang tak sama kan dia orang two different fruits ah lain kan
siapa ah yang come out eh nama-nama ni
tu lah
lain eh aiyo

so aku macam okay
ah so like in the car it was packed apa lima orang exactly lima orang
and then like I don't want to say eh kau orang nampak ke tak
eh cause I scared if I tegur then suddenly
no depan lagi no depan lagi depan lagi depan lagi you know they have ever that kind of thing if you tegur and then the thing just follow you
so just diam
so when they send to kallang all the way I walk home right I press the lift I look back I press the thing I look back I before before I go masuk ke rumah I look back because I scared
I scared if I bring that thing home my mother scold me I'm not scared of that thing nanti mak aku macam engkau ni keluar malam-malam bawa benda tak tak senonoh masuk rumah
then of course asyik tengok belakang kau tahu ni picit lift
dah keluar lift bismillah
buka pintu bismillah assalamualaikum pusing lagi okay tak ada tak ada
putih betul eh I check lah bolster I dia ke bukan aku takut siol
I check sia I takut kalau betul-betul macam dia
because I I am suka lepak malam-malam

and then when it happened your parents were not annoyed macam apa lah budak-budak ni
I know your papa even ada benda pun dia diam lah takkan dia nak cakap ada lah a'ah bapa nampak takkan dia nak cakap
kira macam jinx
no lah my mother ask me nak potong gigi dia ke nak keluarkan mata dia
tak then you so daring to take three takes
kira pada you you macam siala aku mangsa keadaan seh aku tengah menjalani hidup aku
ya so like they all tell me the story I'm like ah ya ya ya ya and then later this new person mama dia was like she found one yet and I'm like uh uh nurul kata memang ada
I never see but like it's it's true benda memang jadi
so I cannot deny lah I rasa mesti ada
you close club at ten o'clock ten oh ten ten ten you never come out the thing halau you lah sia

ya so macam eh siala kau orang ni real siol
the connected to the hotel apa the for the swimming pool
pagi orang opening shift so opening shift
no opening shift is masuk siala I open the shutter I have to be the first person there
unless I open shutter aunty cleaner ada
dia open shutter dia nampak member jalan
so dia macam sir the gym is not open yet
kau first person tau buka apa yang kau nak berbual dengan member
so uh then I say why you why you say like that no because I didn't think like that lah I think macam member macam uh coming from the the swimming pool like you forget to lock the door or what then he sneak in
so this person jalan towards this treadmill ni pillar eh jalan this way so this I thought macam oh kau nak main catching I will walk here and kejar you surround you here
so dia dah tunggu sini tunggu tunggu tunggu orang ni tak jalan-jalan so dia tengok tak ada
and dia macam okay lah tak apa lah maybe orang ni dah keluar pergi back door ke apa lah tak tahu lah dah keluar balik dekat shutter dia pergi tengok dekat dia berbual seorang
dia kejar benda nothing
and then me asal kau buka asal kau very curious
tak ada ah aku nak kena tengok betul-betul apa dia masuk daripada pintu mana aku nak tengok closing shift semalam tak tutup pintu ke apa I need to know
kau nak hidup kau ni sekarang apa maksud dia hidup kau tak ada makna tau hidup kau tu permainan syaitan
macam benda yang macam kena tolak ni semua okay ah kena kena pekik you know you hear it you feel the air but you don't see it
terus dah tired gitu and then
so ah so ya people when they say hempap eh hempap ni semua dia ada scientific reason
when I tengah itu aku buka aku dapat buka mata cuma aku tak dapat pekik aku dapat buka mata

ya the thing is that it happens to everyone including the lady and all like like it's constant it's not like memilih
gee what what what's wrong with me dulu berani eh tau then sekarang macam open shutter
ya lah that is my bekal lah I haven't eat lah I don't know what to eat
that's why like my break time I really macam because breakfast I don't makan
like unless my mother like prepare for me and I makan ah tapi kalau dia tak kasih then macam tak ada ah
eh japan pula thailand tamarind chicken
wet market and market pasar market
so mee soto nasi ayam sup kambing the best sup kambing in singapore is there
pasar lah
ya we have kedai mamak like you know the movies
at the pasar there where you can find variety of food lah
but like the only thing that I find macam sedap gila
nasi ayamdia in the world
like you can eat the rice only and then you will feel like damn sedap
nasi ayam now
you know those bawah block yang ada own fast food thing
nasi ayam western those chicken the rice is chicken rice
tapi dia punya chicken tu macam yang two wing
like the malay food I would not recommend kalau macam makan lunchtime only during your breakfast sedap gila because that two kedai only open for breakfast and they will close
dia sedap gila they only open for breakfast
siala aku belum tanya pun siol
cheebye tak ada tak ada tak ada tak ada dah habis dah habis dah habis dah habis
hey sedih sia
nak apa dik at least lah eh
makcik ni false hope ah
mm or sotong ball
uh apa tu
you boleh bukakan tak package I tak nak lah
semua big and then irritating lepas tu selalunya my cat down here then I say eh tepi lah
dah lah aku ni berbulu dia ni pun berbulu
forty five kecil begini jer nanti hug dia
tak nak lah super light gray this is nice this is just nice
oh it's nice pasar makan
pasar makan jer
hey actually okay lah but then like I cannot I condemn nasi campur melayu
it's so mahal
it's called my kampung
chinese stall you know tak chinese stall yang macam economy rice
but they make it nasi padang
ya and then tempat then like got a lot of cuisine and then everything's halal and then like you don't have to worry
sebelah dia ada waffle
siot lah tak ada mood sia
ya but because I think like clifford tu macam kena jalan kena tempuh tempuh clifford kena tempuh like tau
kat rumah that's all
oh so most of the time during the holiday kau kat kerja ah
ah okay okay oh ya lah that time kau bilang kan ah
ya okay lah but still know because of this pandemic right tak banyak orang ah so the you know the lorong right when they all usually like ah lalu right
true lah but tetap masih ada macam budak townees ah
no no no as in like I only started few weeks ago so ya kirakan baru start ah
semangat masih boil ah
ya alhamdulilah dah dah dapat ah
I confirm stress tapi I think it's manageable lah
masing-masing ah
ngam-ngam lah that you all that like dah rapat already
but all this uh all budak history ah
track and field lah but silat
at least ya at least you all know betul-betul joining together ah
oh oh okay okay okay awesome kirakan too much commitment ah
cause you know dia kan belajar kat china kan so when he came back
masih ah but then when he come back
you're like going there physically cause kan medicine kena buat those like physical
ya so now he just lepak kat rumah you know
dia kan ambil kan
you have to do what you have to do ah sebagai you know the abang-abang besar kan
mm ya betul correct correct
what bila ah
bulan oh september ya correct correct
oh that means apply kat
ah kau dah biasa dah buat kan
I mean you did throughout your few years kat the uh
mm mm ya that's good but bila ah bila the results keluar
kalau apa-apa ke apa-apa you just update me ah cause
so so boleh macam you know meet up minum kopi chat chat
ya see but I guess tu kau punya rezeki ah
maybe it's it's better ya kau punya nasib ah better that you've stayed in singapore
cause and then again like the virus situation so belum contain right
oh ya ya ya so have you save up save up for the you know the eventual you punya
oh ya ya ya do it do it do it err I would say it's quite erratic ah dia punya upload like
err cause he has a few differing passions lah kan ah so the initial golf err content that he used to upload right has been on a hub for awhile lah so this sekarang like this past few days he's been you know more interested in collecting airplane models
quite canggih ah for his age
this is the first time kurang experience
ah ya ya ya ya betul betul betul
ya kena ikut dia punya apa
the syarat-syarat
very diligent ah ikut dia punya
err undang-undang ah
dia okay
tu yang penting ah
ya I mean furthermore ours even more mahal lah dia punya apa school the yuran lah so
mmhmm kerja bayar jer uh this ah very efficient ah
slow jer like star wars punya the highlight reel ah
mm dia kan punya
is it held on apa which platform zoom
oh yang the sekolah dah apa sponsor
bro macam mana bro
the thing dah cair ah
but right that means if she's not at home then they won't leave it kat depan pintu ah
ya you know those the standard ones at the floral express where there are they put my macam
ya the standard one ah ya err cukup for that show some appreciation lah
you know sedekah
tu lah it's the standard lah you know how
no lah no no dude that one that one purely my rezeki ah
nasib ah nasib
well I guess communication is key ah yang penting ah so
potential nak kena backfire ah you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it macam tame first
furthermore kalau main also like
so cannot play sampai lambat also kan
tak betul ah ah I know ah
oh apa ni
baik tau
he quit or kena buang
oh but ya I heard back then dia punya temper also quite
but kalau I think
I should be down to jam with you all lah kalau jumaat lepas solat
if you want to go together then kena apply online kan to get the queue
dia orang fast game ah dah apply online
the best seats is tingkat berapa
takde yang rapatkan saf lah
kena expand
the wuduk area now they dia orang taruh apa sanitizer
so then that means salam pun tak boleh ah
orang only the orang atas would know lah all what is set in stone lah
and that one pun mostly kat my
ya so it's the same old kedai kopi and err you know the mall right ya
ya the standard breakfast punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng
ah okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that macam dah second nature kan ambil wuduk
oh cik jamal oh I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest punya supporter
cause you punya opponent mm
mid table but kalau menang the last two matches then
a bit out of reach ah ya jauh sangat
tu yang quite disappointing ah
um win ah so syabas to them
dua puluh tahun is it ya liverpool won punya premier league
but I will have to say ah dia punya though he quite semangat ah
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be melampau ah
is he is he still the regular kat your fire station
mm no doubt lah he is really a budak baik lah
biasa ah you know just
ya so a bit sedih ah
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I kena posted kat foxtrot division ah tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat this area ah
oh I would say there's a fair share of calls lah there's there's still ongoing back then lah err but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like macam woodlands jurong
but no doubt lah there's always calls here and there lah whether their severity macam
ya I I feel the same way ah as as much as like you know the berita dia orang cover and all these cases of
macam mismanagement
I think it's isolated punya cases
cause biasanya macam
tak macam gitu ah usually it's more civilized and laid back ah I would say nothing much going on ah
kan kena stay active kan
ya but I think is tak susah ah tak susah sangat lah but it's
kena biasakan so
mm cause when you when you first start lah like after one ten and then usually you togok air like melampau ah but
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree ah kan I mean cause banyak orang banyak orang tak
tak begitu informed lah about this kind of stuff ah so
it is the right way lah is to jangan minum banyak ah you have to conserve
like macam
kena full cool down mode already ah
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little lah it's cause you you minum melampau ah basically
ah that's true lah cause kalau kau minum banyak kan the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
kau punya badan is like you know get gets in a shock
uh so the more you biasakan with more water then the more likely you will
kenakan the effects of that heatstroke ah
ni semua kena belajar ah
mm yang tepat ah
oh the biji ah biji
biji-biji kecil ah
the biji take out then you blend the kulit but but then
bila kau minum kan
oh do you blend the kulit ah
but kau kena
kau kena like see first lah whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars ah before kau tambah extra sugar or anything lah when you blend
with the sugar level already dah cukup already
tak payah tambah extra stuff
ah lain
err grapefruit is besar sikit
sama sama ya
ya it's uh pelik sia
ya but kau kena potong ah before you put dalam you punya blender
dia dengan the what's the girl's name ah
dia dengan fy dah berapa lama together
nothing much ah I tadi cause I got sekolah what
so it's just school from home ah sekarang
pay attention sikit sikit
but then cause my fridays free ah so I got nothing to do I thought boleh kerja sambil-sambil
kat sana kerja dah punya lah senang
but then my rest also dorang bayar
but then dorang tak nak ambil cause I still schooling ah then they say like apa ni
aku actually boleh kerja sia
then gitu duit masuk so senang ah but then wasted lah I never think of it lah
dah lama ah tak makan sana because like
diam sudah no ah I mean like
but hijrah barang lama ah now the people there all
faiz faiz lagi extreme no I think faiz is like the epitome of extreme you know
going to the gym person pasal like my friend all say like if I go gym all ah
dorang semua cakap like macam confirm badan pau punya ah
but gym just very intimidating ah like aku rasa macam
seram ah like go there people all tengok-tengok semua
tapi kecil is okay you know kecil cause
but like if you see orang gemuk kan orang gemuk confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy semua pe
I don't know ah later people kat gym tengok like eh try hard pe this guy
forever sia macam gini
at least I looked proportionate ah like don't look so bulat
then these days I want to check already but my parents tak tukar the battery ah for the
no not really after ah after still got a lot of outfields semua pe so we still keluar banyak-banyak
makan banyak ah cause of
then it's cause of ah always order in asyik beli jer then sekali
dah getting rounder ah
the longer you are in army right the more lepak the
rumah ella kat mana eh oh ya ya ya correct correct correct
uh uh rumah ella
kat belakang ah
like from rumah ella you walk to tracks
then there's a coffee shop there ah Fatty Bom Bom kat sana
eh it doesn't make sense leh I mean like okay like kau tahu uh
but then in this case like abang gemuk and Fatty Bom Bom no difference what both halal already what
so like they tukar nama for what sia
that time also ada ah
so like like when I go lia's house senang ah
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes sampai ah
uh kau tahu dunman sec kat mana
ah dekat ah
malas pe dah cakap malas nak exercise
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance yang jauh it's like
ya but like macam
confirm malas sia nak keluar it's easier for you to just order
but that one tengok ah kalau
if only kalau ada discount ah
uh then then got the then got the telur so it's like more like fried rice like that lah
I never try abang gemuk before ah so cannot say ah
but a bit mahal ah that day I eat it's like six ninety
pasal dorang dorang bagi banyak ah
tak tapi even though the portion worth kan but I feel like it's like two people portion ah
macam the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
but over there they give the full bowl ah then the ayam pun dorang bagi dua
I think new ah the shop dulu takde ah
I don't really remember ah because usually dulu kita orang makan sana
always makan the
I play public game like macam
always kena thrashed ah
then aku tunggu kau download warzone sampai sekarang belum download
kental lah
I don't know how come your computer semua games tak boleh sia
like it's more to like main sendiri
like cause dorang ada macam like a energy system like that
then kau boleh buat the stuff you need to do ah
you finish what you need to do already then just tunggu ah
better than runescape ah tapi
like kau kena tunggu ah resin kau fill up baru kau boleh main
console pun ada
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales ah they spent banyak ah
dude gila like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
like empat ribu lima ribu
so it's like really luck based ah tengok ah your luck macam mana
pernah pernah ah ah last time I buy the skin
so macam I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like lima belas eh
wasteful ah spend duit kat game
ada ah additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
it it makes a difference but like macam
tak leh nampak sangat ah like you need like
so tak rasa sangat
uh uh kau macam tak you like don't know me like that ah
hmm sejak bila
like kau compare dengan basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
a'ah tapi tapi bola macam
like I book my solat jumaat tak dapat
dah lama sia
tapi tak dapat ah
since the booking start I never I never kena dapat I think cause I always book late ah
so dah semua all the slots dah fill up kan then dah tak boleh
dah tak boleh dapat slot ah
then uh aku tak leh buat for the next five weeks
a'ah so other people can get ah but some more aku selalu tak dapat ah
tak tahu ah
tak nak ah
tengok kerusi all
uh and streamers uh aku tengok mostly streamers pakai the ini ah Secret Lab one
asal mahal sangat sia it's just a chair right
tak ah tapi tapi even though
it's leather you know leather actually murah seh
tak tahu ah
I mean you you said it yourself right like dorang apa similar kan
sama ah
I mean okay warranty dia is apa one for one exchange or what
macam tak masuk akal right like
kau ambil pisau kau potong seh already
okay how about macam kalau air tumpah
air tumpah on the thing
okay but what if it's like kau tumpah kan Coke
that time that time siapa eh tunjuk aku uh I think
achap ah achap tunjuk aku the video
orang pakai Coke
untuk cuci toilet
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks ah like even time hari raya kan
uh okay usually guest just eh uh tuan rumah dorang selalu just tuang kan
my my nenek punya side more of Coke ah so they got like
then another container is all just uh apa ni F&N
ya hari raya
so if I go my nenek house
it's really just gassy drinks atau teh
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea gitu
apa eh the other one yang ah the hijau one the hijau one sedap ah
tak tapi the best one I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but susah ah nak cari like everywhere I go like most most kedai tak jual ah
it confirm pernah it's the orange colour one
but sekarang susah nak cari I think they stopped production already ah I haven't I haven't seen it
takde takde takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit
takde duit takde table tennis
I think no more already confirm dorang dah buang punya like the thing so lup sup you know
macam repeat
then macam
tak ah tapi sekarang not that bad because like
but then eh you got lobang for kerja or not
I don't know ah like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all semua yang tak halal
aku tak pernah kerja banquet
yang sebelah yang sebelah Hard Rock Cafe
ya cause uh my friend from dulu kerja
uh like the table chair stage semua dorang set up
then usually it's for like reception gitu ah wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just tunggu for the event to finish then they teardown
but dorang punya is more for ini kan is like
like apa ni concerts semua kan
kat Shangri-La that that type
he just delegate the work semua then duduk goyang kaki goyang ah
kerja senang ah tak yah buat banyak sangat ah
oh ya but Marche tak halal lah
eh jangan gini ah
berbual really like proper english punya you know and like
a bit more to the mahal side ah
then dia dapat banyak apa ni
uh banyak freebies semua
but then dia kira balik kan actually what he paid for
but I heard the cakes there good ah the the kuih lapis cake ah
should try ah should try go there makan
can ajak C what
eh eh you tell her first ah eh I'm not gonna pay for you mm bayar sendiri
muka sedih ugh
I I I think nanti aku re-watch ah
I think it's like a company just uh macam get all these people kan
then dorang buat macam a short video macam as a skit
kau imagine macam
macam key and peele
okay ah tapi no matter how many times I re-watch eh
kekek gila ah I will still laugh and laugh and laugh ah
like semalam semalam adik aku main the
key and peele yang mana eh
what apa what's name eh
asal achap tak leh
I thought and him best friend already just now talk on Discord macam
macam brother eh
nanti nanti nanti there he he sniff all our cigarettes sia
tengok ah nanti I play for fun ah
apex apex game dia macam mana
tapi dia punya graphics semua macam cartoon-ish kan
oh uh kira kan macam halo kind of graphic ah
busy dengan sekolah
tapi sekarang five berapa
is now is mahal cause orang resell eh
I don't know ah like semua orang like rebut nak beli P eh actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console lah
ada ah main ah
like when I go to my apa ni cousin's house
aku dari dulu kan like
my parents macam
but computer pun my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
dorang like cakap okay uh haris uh
kau main twenty minutes
my father ah my father cakap like eh haris uh okay ah
suddenly like everyone kat uh kat luar then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the
so my father cakap dengan the salesperson the salespersons cakap like
eh cik if you want to buy game boy
dah ah tak ah tak yah panggil gemuk pe
the once the slim one come out semua beli ah
I think it's cause it's different lah like you don't really have any console yang kau boleh use touch screen kat bawah tapi still got the tactile buttons
just want to show off features ah ada dual screen kind of
no but Switch still got ada ada animal crossing ada
but quite popular what aku tengok banyak orang sia main
tak pernah ah
oh okay okay faham faham ya
until now I I looking to play it again you know but tak leh jumpa ah it's called what is it called eh uh
total war tak pernah ah
ya apa eh got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro yang
korang boleh like form a squad then do like
apa ah nama dia
oh oh is it is it the one yang kau kena kena fix the generators semua
I never see before ah ipin I only see him post punya video ah
for one hero no cause in is as long as you play a hero banyak-banyak kan
so kalau kau nak clamp the ranking kena main banyak ah
ya for other country is by state so like johor macam johor will be
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to macam separate semua orang
okay ah for me I find it interesting also but I not so into it sampai
so macam like the
malay heritage semua kan dia tahu ah
the different type of culture semua
quite cool eh actually cause like apparently orang melayu really
they control like the whole trade route semua
now semua
what what you want to makan
kau tengok Guga Foods ah
like with the with the what do you call that the onions semua
eh but guga he got his own ini sia industrial size tempat masak grill
at in his home there's like a restaurant punya size punya grill
no ah I think they slowly ini ah
purchase like I think they see it as macam business purchase gitu
cause dorang beli semua is to promote their channel what in the end
so he memang nak
he buy the good stuff lah like his knife semua bagus punya all like
ah ya ya ya correct correct they buy dia beli the knife from like macam garage sale like that
ah ya the rust out semua
but then yang ini okay ah yang you know those kanjiro kind

then is dorang jual like legit kira kan like boleh potong orang punya
that one quite ni ah he but that guy keluar kan samurai sword ah
to potong someone
oh my gaji you want me to tell you figures now ah
for for me I think per hour is like lapan and then like my
not so panjang also not so pendek also so it's okay lah
but you're only doing this for like how long tiga bulan kan
err patients especially like those like tua tua ones they're quite entitled that's why they feel they're like ya

to think balik
you know at least kau sudah
walaupun macam kau think balik now now kau think balik err whatever that kau err going through
before kau tak ada kerja and then kau tengah
kau dapat that skills err future now kau sudah ada that that sudah ada that skill the only thing kau want to progress
but um do you think macam you have gone you think kau sudah pergi quite far juga eh
berapa tahun eh semua kau dah berapa tahun agak-agak kau ah gunting eh
oh semua ini satu tahun saja
oh daripada two thousand and nineteen
tapi kau suka juga ke I mean sekarang ni kau dah come to a point yang macam kau
find it macam dah terlalu err repetitive ah kan
mm habis kalau kau
if you are given a chance untuk um
sound engineer atau gunting rambut
eh the other day kau pergi err airport
dengan anak kau eh semua birthday eh
oh oh she went out dengan your folk your folk ah
kau kau ada ini tak bagi tahu dia yang err aku send regards

degil which is kan bagus ah ke tak degil degil dia ke tak
ada lah ada that's err it's been quite awhile man
it's been quite awhile geng pasal ya um
err you know lah pasal
COVID you know err I think the last one kita met was probably before
COVID right it was uh kau datang sini um
the recording yang aku nak nak minta kau tolong untuk aku pergi
is there anymore yang kau datang rehearsal is there any rehearsal
mm lama ah about diam tak diam dah
ah dah enam bulan ah
so ya tapi dah oh no dengan ayah tu is probably when uh farhan ah
kita nak work on lagu farhan ya
aku kind of tengah
tak ada tak ada majority things yang come to aku punya err aku punya life
I've now baru start main bicycle err aku baru beli bicycle err a cruiser
err aku just pergi cruising around dengan family aku
err other than that aku rasa aku working on some project macam
aku been doing a lot of err things kat
err nothing fantastic yang aku rasa tengah going on
which is err ah tapi
aku rasa tenang ah macam biasa ah
tenang ah so more more of and more more upcoming projects
yang akan kami you know macam
but paling boring is err tak dapat pergi err seberang tambak ah
itu yang paling boring ah pada aku for the past six months ini
sebab member member yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga
ah aku suppose I think err I think err dia bukan
ah maybe maybe betul pada kau macam in thing sebab semua orang
but the point is sebab tak ada
tak ada activity yang tak boleh keluar negeri jadi
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is juga
it's the best time untuk nak explore and then kita are much more older right now
I guess it's the exploration yang
it will stop orang kata macam
I mean time sekolah kita kan dulu explore kat bawah block lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh
err main
main tangkap spider at some point of time kan kita orang dah malas buat benda ni because kita nak kerja
so when kita dah kerja probably kita jumpa somebody
err bila mm jumpa kawan
ah nonsense buat nonsense nonsense punya barang then
aku rasa at this point of time pasal kita orang kena
jadi mungkin aku rasa that's the best time untuk um beriadah ah
untuk just do leisure out of
kau punya own comfort zone jadi this is the best time untuk kau come back to kau punya
err youth balik ke
you know where kau kau missing out
ah and aku rasa it's a good good good thing juga with this um
aku rasa kita will tend to macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita itself
ada this tempat ada that tempat ada
then kita pun tahu yang macam okay kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat right now apart from just makan
kita start to do cycling will start to explore macam
um tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi before
ah so aku rasa
it's good juga ah
but err kalau kau cakap about that is the the the in thing right now
but not just aku rasa ada orang pun buat not just err cycling tahu
but randomly but now is macam semua orang dah start to macam even
uh explore our own country punya whatever yang ada kat dalam ah not just bab makan jer
ya I mean yang kalau kau cakap pasal longkang it's definitely
at this point of time tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang
tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang tapi
but if there if there are thing macam tu aku rasa there will be possibilities pun pasal
pasal it's not macam something yang apa
something yang err
normal but aku rasa
might never know longkang tu pergi mana sekarang semua orang banyak go on the tahu
macam kira park connector punya
like recently aku just started cycle daripada where aku ah
yes and it was actually pada aku macam
oh and then kau tak kau tak nak explore right macam
so dude during that that that exploration tu
err aku from hougang going to bukit batok um go through macam
and you err you wouldn't you wouldn't realize ya macam
the park connectors are macam really boleh bawa kau macam daripada um
or daripada wherever daripada sini pun daripada
all the way boleh sampai ke clarke quay
clarke quay all the down all the way sampai dekat queenstown
from queenstown keluar pergi dekat buona vista
from buona vista all the way pergi bukit batok how's ah
going from the east side aku tak tahu there are such a thing macam itu tak
ah was it macam dah start dekat uh east area boleh kau realize tak
okay tak
I mean kau kau dah pergi ah juga tu ke ataupun kau
pass by ke kau jogging ke tak ataupun kau nampak jer
oh so sudah sudah kau sudah use that lah dekat
then daripada daripada uh
tampines to bedok ada you think
for now kau dah nampak yang tampines to pasir ris
hougang betul tak baru dia come dia come in right
look at that macam
eh kau err ini hari tak buat apa-apa ke sia
macam apa selalu kau buat on saturday
when you were in your mid twenties gitu
mm dia orang you know they they they they they even like
like now kan macam
go back in time tak
kau tak nak tak suka pergi east coast
kau rasa kau ada kau rasa kau ada penyakit tak with that
tak ah I mean aku cakap dengan kau pasal there are some people who
tak mandi err would would find themselves
it's actually bukan rabak ah punya penyakit it's just that something yang
yang penyakit yang tak familiar ah but you have that you know
huh it's not it's not a bad punya ini lah maksud aku macam kadang-kadang kan macam
ada orang uh tak boleh main dekat
err tak boleh main dekat rumput
ada so itu penyakit
mungkin pada kau it's something yang
macam orang tak familiar macam mungkin pada kau orang rasa kau macam leceh
tapi sebenarnya it's um
bukan pasal tu it's actually memang
it will affect kau punya
mood it will affect kau punya the the the
day yang kau bangun the next day it will affect macam
kau rasa um
ya it's as good as macam kau
might have a macam a feeling yang macam can occur sampai err
tak sedap ah you know tak sedap badan
tak lah tak lah pasal aku aku just wonder lah pasal kadang-kadang kan kenapa aku cakap east coast kan randomly juga pasal kan
err ya lah all this tempat or all this
things yang kita buat ni kan semua macam relate to apa yang aku dengan kau
boleh buat macam east coast was probably buat lagu
cause I guess macam tenang
tapi macam kadang-kadang um tenang but
in the night probably kalau ada kereta
kalau tak ada kereta um
then nak patah balik nak tidur you know macam you know
pagi pagi jer dah sian macam kira sudah pukul
pukul tiga pukul empat atau especially when the
sun is macam really on top of us memang take it will be like macam
ya kau
it was really it was really macam pain lah tapi kalau
kalau ada kenderaan you know um senang sikit kan
macam ataupun macam tak overnight lah you know grab or what not
so ya lah and yang macam
all these benda benda yang macam um
err exploration ini semua kan macam as kita grow
like aku rasa ini semua macam
things yang uh a cycle eh
kita cakap right now is like kau going to almost
err reaching kau punya four digits
ya aku sudah aku sudah forty ya
habis yang yang baru-baru ni semua kira time dekat COVID tu
kau just stay rumah ke ke kau ada cabut juga pergi mana-mana
kau takut tak time yang lockdown
pernah ada kau pernah ada sampai itu mentality tak
meaning macam really semua orang dah sakit and then
um went up to kau punya house ketuk ketuk ketuk ketuk macam zombie eh kita cakap macam
macam that kind ah lepas tu sekali macam
macam eh eh eh eh eh
open ah lepas tu macam eh
boy ah open ah itu macam that kind of thing ah
but this was before yang the first phase was the one yang
tak ada chance untuk keluar pun kan
kan that first few weeks kan at least a month tak keluar kan
so this phase two yang that one month tu
tak kan yang kedai-kedai gunting pun
yes and then ada phase two right
ya so this was macam the first
first few days yang when dia orang announce tak boleh keluar
ah aku was having so much err banyak banyak um
kind of macam err slowly slowly became macam
dalam diam aku did a lot of shopping you know macam
macam online shopping which is aku never that did did that before ah but I really did ah
and then ya it was really macam
like any other day any other day it was just macam two dollar punya shopee
three dollar punya stuff and then every
like every two three days mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku eh
but ya lah it was really funny that aku err ada that phase ah
because aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat eh
mm I mean being apa yang engkau nak buat
and then kita orang tak ada that that that that
tanah lapang you know we don't have a big um
kalau kau nak pergi luar to check people out pun macam
aku rasa that that experience was really macam best untuk aku ah
and then because aku pun ada at some point of time
err during that circuit time pun aku hantar
aku punya aku punya senior aku punya dad dekat hospital jadi
aku saw how the street are lonely
phase one is when everybody macam really macam
sudah come back to macam you know
I think yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka
during err apa err
during err circuit breaker punya time pun I think um
I did walk around lah macam pergi mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing ah macam
it was really macam almost to
almost to macam
being in the eighties balik where there is not much people around
but at the same time pun macam lonely juga
because kita pun will be hide inside
you know macam it's okay if you're younger
semua benda boleh boleh change kalau tak betul-betul you can change you punya
crazy also juga kan
so ya lah but still pun
ah the effect and I just macam for the
tak tahu how it will go on lah but I guess
this is one part of our life yang kita jumpa ah you know
it might happen again or it might happen again but lagi more ah
kerja ah it's not no work you know affected
aku rasa it's err more of err
tapi it's not the war of bombing lah gitu
it's macam um
macam um
it's macam
a smooth war ah you know a smooth war that macam
kita tak boleh expect that you know
kita tak boleh expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone macam
tak ada kerja or probably macam
where everyone was really macam
kerja atau tak kerja lah
ah but now is macam
or the environment macam play err err
make them to kind of macam stop from
oh itu lah itu lah um
aku pun macam kira macam wow after all these years err
I I was having a conversation the other day balik pada macam
ah you know macam err you know talking about
music in general macam macam err the whole world right now is err having
or the whole creative punya line in the whole wide world is um
habis aku was just err bagi tahu
err deedee the other day a friend of kau tahu deedee lah kan
so aku bagi tahu deedee about macam you know the rest of the world
um especially macam dekat and what not
dia orang punya creative was kind of macam stopped right now
kita orang was that macam kita orang tak ada industry and kita orang nak kena stop juga
so macam you get what I mean it's like macam um
macam ya lah
but kita orang kind of tak ada industry
pun nak kena stop juga sama macam dia orang
and lagi teruk
ya I mean but what lucky enough juga what if kalau kau dah baru graduate
kau baru graduate last year probably baru nak start kerja dah
you know but now lucky enough macam kau ada time untuk breather you know a bit breather and
you can have time untuk
apa kau nak buat ready untuk next you know
because right now also everything macam kau was talking about
uh all this macam kerja dekat dalam studio
and you know right now everyone was really macam
mm really macam
ya lah tak tak boleh go out for
for in the studio pun kalau tak betul-betul
and even now the studio are all not operating pun
ya it's like the same thing like what happened dekat ini juga
crazy times juga
youtube just used whatever content you know macam
ya semua orang macam
anyhow ah kira macam sembarang ah kira uh it's ya
and even macam sekarang ini macam netflix and there are big big err
but how they going to use all these macam despite of time
you know macam how can they macam selit how can they like you know err
aku I'm very sure there will be there will be light somewhere
it's just that macam
aku rasa don't don't don't give up don't give up for the sake of giving up just because you tak macam
but the thing is take it as if macam there's a new skill yang kau belajar
like also kau kena ingat juga since kau cakap video dah ada
aku rasa you should share it ah you know macam
because like ya macam
is is like apa
somebody dekat dalam kat india
I mean iphone punya itu okay lah no I mean iphone bad examples because they already copyrighted all the
all the way the series so like in that same vein you can actually do that ya like if you wanted money ah you know unless dia orang macam like ah okay ah kita skip one generation that kind of thing so it will be very weird it will be like
then five is apa roman numerical V
I mean I have tukar topik ah like I have troubles
cannot sia boring gila siol
boring gila
no that's the thing the other thing is I have to clarify was apa this transport allowance right
gaji then like for what sia
like the the the culture quite laid back quite lepak ah considering like anytime you can just ask somebody to cover for you because they all like okay
you work in shifts then after you work morning then cukup time dah lapar eh
kau nak apa apa tak kat kedai kopi

then if tak then order from Grab
the during the kerja but sometimes
because dia punya tempat kat town

asal kan makanan sampai boleh makan dah cukup that kind of thing
like no see that's the thing there's a lot of patient customers out there like kalau kau ajak fight dah dua jam then tu lain cerita ah or the worse one is

bodoh ah it's just bodoh
the first one was too tight ya that one that one was too tight but okay ah the rest all fine so okay ah apa-apa ah
in other formation gegenpress ah so tak boleh just sembarangan ah ni
the what what clubs other than the english premier league tak ada logo
so so apa uh what what what club are you planning to manage
on aku main is that time time poly is sixteen
ah before download it your kau nya laptop macam mana like what is the specifications cause aku tak nak
which apa brand ah
NVIDIA uh have semua semua all have ah
laptop boleh pakai ke tak untuk
apparently okay for for for for storage data I have a lot memang ada banyak lah
lah ini what's the difference I don't know touch is just for anything that is not computer but also not mobile phone pe I don't know why mobile phone cannot work cannot simulate touch although
ah kalau
ya betul betul betul

all these is over then maybe aku will check it out lah
takde ah I don't have I don't have the the the
tak baru it's it's quite latest one you know it's two thousand nineteen era
but I don't have the LAN cable cause well is more to you know more to notebook yang flat flat those ah
those ah ah okay the the reason why aku ada this laptop is pasal mak aku nak buat you know photoshop and and whatever nonsense ah
so and that one is used to for my adik punya apa tu school
which Zoom pun boleh lag
no I mean sorry let me be more specific opening Zoom dah lag
running the whole thing nak type password dah you know when you type your full password then it takes a few second before the password starts to appear ah then
that cleaner equipment last longer blah blah blah but I don't know how my little brother pakai you know go to school carry here carry there sometimes go to
nanti eh so
the whole day ah nanti kau ah kau keluar
new features with you that I may not be familiar with ah tapi
maybe take a good look about it tengok-tengok look
real good imagine I mean if you maybe look the singapore league dia cakap
ah new season pe new season they go home and whatnot then how they gonna come back I lost a lot of star player then I got the argentinian guy or whatever his name is in johor ah ya takzim darussalam eh johor takzim
that is kalau ada orang
apa nobody give
serie A apa punya guess
actually quite sad eh kalau kau if you're from the
it be quite you know quite sedih kan actually to be what to be honest
but ah english english wise takde
takde tak I I I've seen the
english punya league
cam the championship league one league two blah blah blah blah blah you know
ye from national then north south
which is on the same path they still have below and below and below ada below what the heck I think I think it's
regulate themselves dissolve all the useless clubs cause I think it's too much imagine kalau you know
singapore ada
S league delta league don't know what actually kita ada lah that is why the government decide to dissolve
I mean ya lah I mean that macam adik aku every
every night ah dia ah he come back from his camp army camp nanti around
maybe six plus dia makan by seven he will be out
dengan member member dia uh kat bawah block
then main bola sampai pukul sepuluh balik
so everyday like this but he's not gonna tell us lah whether he he play in league ke he play in what nonsense ah cause
he has to play football I think it's not no longer fun anymore ah abeh takkan takkan seh eh
nak main bola like every single day at this certain time wearing this certain jersey with certain boot I think it's a bit
whatever it is ah but there's a lot of african kid who's buncit so I can relate
year one eh kena okay anyway ah
seven years that's lama pe aku poly
bankrupt aku wait wait wait
tahun empat tahun pastu ah enam enam years ah I haven't been playing football actually lama pe
no body contact I mean this is the rules and regulation by that one no body contact so kalau nak tackle

takde time you want to sleep more then work
spartan the hello universe but then if they are just standing down there looking at itik ayam kambing
