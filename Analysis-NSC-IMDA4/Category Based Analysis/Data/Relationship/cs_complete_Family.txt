apa you belajar kat sana
then which one which one your most favourite ah mana satu
my course ah my course is uh also known as apa uh marine engineering
like dia macam um okay so basically
like my job progression kan lepas
err apa err diploma kan is like working either apa the sailing or or at a shipyard gitu ah
okay for third year aku rasa uh aku what ah
so like um for me I I pick the shipyard job ah because I heard of like very good like uh what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing ah because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing uh bila kau sail kan uh macam
enam months like that
six month gitu ah away from your families lah which I don't think I personally think I cannot ah you know
but it's definitely something aku macam look forward to ah like in in the future ah gitu
then also apa eh okay um apa dia eh oh okay
but like I planning to ah so now apa eh uh my first year kan ah I only got to like try out the different ah so like we all can like
apa choose ah the various types of sports or
kat sekolah we you can choose ah so I for the for me I pick the apa floorball lah like something new lah for me like I never try before ah
apa eh uh
quite fun ah you know enjoyable your ah kawan kawan you know quite fun ah
apa sport I prefer
ah apa eh okay got offer quite a few sport ah
you know you got apa soccer and basketball got tchoukball gitu
but I I don't know ah for poly I maybe won't pick like apa eh
uh clubs as in macam
got like the engineering dia ada punya business
then macam
I was planning to join ah in the first year tapi
apa eh uh tak dapat like you must go for apa
like I talk banyak tau
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I tak dapat you know
but hopefully if I tried apply again dapat ah
like for your course other than like programming gitu
for me personally kan uh I enjoy the apa workshop ah not for like year one
because I apa secondary school I pilih ah what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology ah
so like for me is uh is fun lah cause it's actually something new ah some s- some of the what uh workshop practice or something you like welding uh you got the two types of welding macam gas welding ngan apa
arc welding ah something new ah then I macam lepak lepak you know
but err on workshop cause I workshop ah aku rasa macam four hours ah gitu
then okay for my course right uh they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like uh different kind of apa eh dia punya skills ah
err apa they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like dia macam ada
if you just go for interview eh no sorry my bad but instead of interview apa eh uh internship when you go for internship err what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
uh purifier room okay purifier room is macam like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right err you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test ah it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
if I'm not wrong kita will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me ah cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly macam like inspection you know like okay as
ape benda like other things I do other than in school lah
kay for me right apa eh uh in my free time I like to game you know
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right uh I start off with mobile gaming ah then I started moving to apa dia punya competitive scene ah
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two ah then the prizes macam uh gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
ya so you obviously ada experience kan
mm can lah you just you just go for it ah dulu
ah okay lah because like semalam I got study like the whole night you know like macam two
at three gitu I went for an appointment ah
how should I say macam
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say apa eh uh it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation ah so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like apa eh
legit all the makcik makcik atuk atuk oi all queuing up lah
gitu then
once they cut open they take out the apa
macam a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
apa eh
you suka apa
uh do like apa small business eh is it is that what you do
ah ya calligraphy business when uh like apa notebook ah
what do I normally do kat rumah eh
the apa uh apa airports cover business obviously not bad ah the business the profits ah ya
like the apa the Paris Disneyland
ya aduh
but but then macam there would definitely be still restriction lah you know like beach maximum capacity
but then again if like apa dia punya deadline is like
I don't do right then my will be affected apa
ah apa our school work ah ya
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course ada tak
like for this semester one kan uh I have this uh project called the module name is which is apa eh uh
so like uh we all macam is
uh two from then macam two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for apa uh
macam a few weeks ago before our final group project so like uh it was during uh hari raya haji right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to uh help them with something and present then when I tell them macam I say I cannot ah I like damn busy today I got my
they should know the different type of apa
err the type of programs dia punya different types of software ah to do like animation ke
tapi kan I tell you ah these guys kan is even the girls tau
they diorang semua they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of apa different type of drawing you know
is to help people with depression you know so like apa eh uh we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
more with macam err people ah online people online ah like strangers you know not in not strangers lah
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing ah like apa the apa the
then our app also ada you have err what ah you have the therapy consultation tab
since our app is based on uh like I said the apa eh the macam Pokemon kan like the virtual pet right
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins ah basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to macam what I decide to do ah
so like the shop right we also have a shop ah the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put err like the what ah poke food poke food includes like the apa
cause like usually my what when I go for interviews I rarely aku macam uh rarely know what to say ah
kirakan oh K K
so lepas
we all have to uh macam go back to you know to kasi balik the coins
but then again you did what during uh bulan puasa
ah it's damn hot then you thirsty then you want to makan right

sekarang what we hear lepas tu ada kata start january ada start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
err tu lah I mean the the the
correspondents tu macam last time when I go melbourne study kan
in seoul is one of the agency other agency pun ada so like this uh uni oh kaplan one of it is there any other agency
uni mana apa buat
but if there's no choice how rasa if
the one that those without the apa is without the examining examination tu macam mana
so nak kena ambil I mean it's the same
if she opt to other macam early childhood
can she use the diploma or tak boleh pasal dia tak bridging
ya example kalau oh this one ada the next one is this one is uh no not examinable
that's two lah satu sama ada dia nak ambil with examinable
and also must know whether the diploma if she has tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi kan
cause if she wait again dah she waste one year ni dia wait again tiga bulan
I thought she say dia punya sekolah macam
career gardens apa
is different course now this the uni is still exist lah I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more kenapa low intake ke
but the thing kalau macam because now pun she take the bus pun she will pay adults fee just no school pass kan
mm waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that baik go to other place seh
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out nanti tak tahu lagi
this is kaplan tukar dia punya uni kan with these courses
can check online tak
cause now is limited time eh sekarang dua puluh plus
I her other friends sekolah mana private mana
kaplan juga bukan
with her behaviour seram
your lifestyle lah kan macam
campur-campur orang okay uh jaga diri
because suasana lain tau suasana part malaysia suasana part suasana part
ada tau ah
tu lah yang si ustaz anak dia kan remember murdoch apa yang ustaz salim pun kan you just uh go over to malaysia lah rather than go
what you can when uh other uni other places kena start dia punya tu kan then from there
kalau kata recognise that's a plus point lah kan I mean singapore to malaysia tu wah one more year
tapi tak ada uni photography eh ada ke
cari apa tu lah you you you sign up with uh intern at Sony
uh ya yang yang yang resale ah resale of
post apa post recruit people

okay lah dia macam probation period dah rupa gitu
so far belum ah
baru tadi oh
mm I mean we still meet ah just pakai mask and stuff
kita actually meet twice a week seh
ah tak serik lah
uh I met his ibu like oh my god nervous uh I call her for now I call her cik dulu lah cik cik suka makan apa cik suka western ke suka indian ke
uh cik cakap apa-apa jer
tak lah tak tak tak kita pergi kat Al-Ameen woodlands
memang nak jumpa dia ah uh uh so actually it was supposed to be earlier but then bapa dia tak kasi like the bapa don't let the mum go out so then only on friday then the bapa let then okay alhamdulillah then I nervous like heck sia
uh so mak dia jer tahu uh uh
sebab dia tak rapat dia cakap he doesn't even talk to his brothers that much then never really go out then I'm like does your brothers know then like ya
tapi kita berbual sampai malam-malam then every time he'll be like I think my brothers sus me already
then I'm like kalau tahu tahu lah
ya sama
mm mm so far takde alhamdulillah like also because right
so like I read up that it was like uh macam satu adventurous and then satu lagi practical like bila sama-sama dia bagus and dua-dua macam bara api gitu jadi macam passion gitu lah
I don't know ah I don't know belum lagi ah so ya so ya but I forgot our I forgot our chinese zodiac
api jer eh
ah tapi tak lah tak lah garang sangat kan
to betul-betul macam
I macam lagi dua ke tiga gitu I pun terlupa around there lah
I think so lah tapi I think his is at most four years gitu
electric engineer eh electrical engineering ah gitu-gitu ah
uh tapi like
he was telling me also lah like he don't really know what he wants to do with his life gitu so takde direction gitu so he say he want to go for course counselling I say okay go go go go go good good good
thought that err because dia punya poly punya course takde exam
so he thought maybe ada exam lagi senang gitu then he thought like maybe like even without macam passion he can still macam buat lah macam survive gitu but then apparently he's like not surviving very well
ya but then he say he finish exam first lah sebab besok dengan besok besok ada
ada exam
if you ask me I say go ahead lah macam if you find something that you like and you really find something that you want to do that's even better than suffering for
ah baru twenty five seh
as from engineering dengan engineering gitu kan
oh boleh macam tu eh
ada strategy tu
macam investment kot I don't know lah eh
tak that's the thing like macam he knows
that he like suka and he wants to do like research in the industry gitu but he don't know where to start and how to get there gitu
uh uh that's what I told him also like that's the first thing I ask macam asal tak pergi digipen like why not then after he say eh I got search for that
then go electrical engineering baru eh
ya ya ya I nak minum air
kerusi aku ni pusing ah
macam suruh dia pergi course counselling ah
I am not the right person to ask also siapa lah aku kan
tak tahu bila lah but some day inshallah
ya lah ya lah ya lah tak ada minat kan
ya sebab sekolah lama seh like you you school like continuously right
mm the macam the momentum kan
so sekarang ni twenty twenty jadi next year
uh huh two a'ah betul two
entah lah tengok dulu lah lepas kahwin kot
and I have no pressure to get married so dia macam so you know what don't stress
lepas kahwin baru fikir ya
once your suami is okay with it then like if anybody else says right you can just like kau siapa suami aku cakap okay apa
uh uh kau siapa
maybe in two to three years then I'm like okay lah kau fikir dulu lah
because to me it's not about the duration is not about macam oh lepas dua tahun nak kahwin oh lepas tiga tahun nak kahwin no it's more like
that's why cause kahwin tak senang seh
ya sia mahal seh
ya exactly and then then during your wedding already people like oh your wedding going to be besar ain punya nanti besar-besar tau then I'm like siapa cakap siapa cakap a'ah I'm like excuse me
exactly eh suka hati jer main cakap jer
uh uh malangnya
mm maybe not necessarily lah my perfect wedding will be dekat kampung ah makan ulam-ulam semua
maybe kampung kat buangkok ke
ada yang satu dekat buangkok ah pulau ubin ke mana tahu weh kan best
ya I know habis pulau semakau pulau tekong
ya but I would I would rather have like a wedding at pulau ubin eh like siapa tak nak pergi pulau ubin okay tidak dijemput bagus filter filter
a'ah ah bukan tak jemput tapi korang tak nak datang betul tak betul ah bagus
ya ya it's okay ah this one macam plus minus lah mm mm
ya I mean I've seen people get married at tuas so I'm like siapa nak pergi tuas
ya so bagus ah siapa takde motor tak boleh datang
a'ah bagus tidak dijemput
uh uh uh uh dia dia saja jer
ke hujung eh
kirim salam sampaikan salam nak kasi duit PayNow takpe
uh uh zaman sekarang semua dah PayNow
but ya it like sebab kalau drive dari luar kan nampak dia punya
nama dia seafood restaurant so I don't know whether they like the building is owned by the seafood restaurant or like they do it at the seafood restaurant itself ya
sentosa mahal
go harbourfront go batam terus
feels like that eh rasa macam gitu ya it's like because
dari sentosa kan I always see all this ferry go to batam kalau lah boleh naik satu feri tu kan bagus
best juga tu
mm best apa
habis wallet
tu dia punya tu tight sikit dia punya schedule dia tak boleh lambat
mm mm ya like jangan nak janji melayu eh janji melayu kapal dah jalan eh please eh
ah lepas tu orang lepas tu kalau makcik makcik semua dah lambat habis semua orang muda dekat terus kan habis clubbing terus
tu bachelorette party seh all out seh
uh mocktail ada mocktail ada ya
ya it's a rooftop bar very nice ya me and adik went
you should I mean it's not cheap lah but like ya mm mm it's just strange because it feels like a nice place to for a date but I came with my brother instead so I'm like mm okay ya I went with adik
ya because right we wanted to get the very nice looking drinks and you know macam instagrammable gitu ah but then when we went
it was a like a brunch punya promotion I think uh brunch menu so it was like a buffet instead so I'm like okay lah
free flow macam barbecue then there's also free flow like telur nak omelette ke scrambled egg ke apa burger uh it's very nice but the I remember like everything was nice you know the
pasta you can choose your sauce chilli crab ke nak aglio olio ke apa uh then
uh and then the tacos I didn't try but then adik said it was nice
when I went then the there's like it comes with like a main so I bought the main and it was very nice it's some seafood soup something like that then you cecah dengan roti
uh but then paling best tu barbecue barbecue dia
cause like the sotong and the ikan and the ayam
tak dia barbecuekan dia macam counter kita just
of all things kan ada sotong ada sausage mm okay ada ayam then you know what was there
but I don't know maybe kita tak tahu makan or something lah maybe we just don't know how to eat lah cause we didn't like it ah very much
it tasted like meat you know then I'm like what is this it's very strange ya but then the good part also ada tempat solat
sebab ada banyak benda-benda kan
oh pahit eh
it's just it's just hilarious lah cause every single time then hazim will be like nak pergi staycation then I'm like what me and you
ajak him first
kekek seh
but I don't know whether abang hafiz will be okay with him and if he will be okay with abang hafiz also
can you imagine abang hafiz with another abang hafiz okay then you just put that in mind
think in the end eh in the end they will just like abang hafiz will call you and then hazim will call me like
tapi voucher belum lagi dapat
uh because tak ambil leave mm
baru boleh ambil leave
ya cause now also I need to take leave then tengok budak-budak sekolah ke tak
ya cause dorang deaths I mean not deaths lah but like dorang punya cases like macam tak terjaga jer
mm mm did you see the numbers everytime umi right like whoa wah malaysia punya numbers naik then I'm like umi
it's always because of like macam
tak lah like the whole show I think wasn't that macam
cautious about it dorang macam tak berhati-hati nak ikut rules tau
and then people are saying like that's only the one that's tested then the one yang tak tested
ya and their country also not that develop like especially macam tengok the medical facilities and stuff kan dalam the hospitals semua tu
it's the culture lah like dorang tak macam
gabra sangat lah I will say ya that's why
ya lah macam conspiracy theory lah
I mean in an emergency and pandemic like this kadang-kadang cannot help it
terpaksa you know because of the resources that they have and stuff like that
so macam it's sad but
terpaksa ah
mm entah lah eh kalau orang tua kita yang paling degil kot macam dorang yang selalu lawan why cannot why cannot wear then after that nanti dorang yang
dorang yang selalu marah-marah orang tau I always see you know all those like boomer whatsapp video then always send one right
then it's always it's always the older population tau is always they are the one that is scolding yang budak-budak muda then budak-budak muda pun nak cakap apa
just follow the instructions government cakap tak boleh government cakap if you don't do this fine three hundred dollar not I say one I say not I say one this one governments say one ya
wah and then there is me I was at choa chu kang interchange okay I was waiting for hazim you know I was waiting for my boyfriend and then and macam cause I came early what dah siap kan jadi duduk dulu lah kan you know dekat drop off
err when you drop off ada kerusi-kerusi gitu
so I duduk situ at the drop off area duduk dulu lah tengok TikTok ke apa dulu ah
tengah lepak-lepak habis lepas tu sebelah like
then after that kita macam kita pakai mask kita tak kita tak berbual pun dalam I didn't even notice she was there I swear
then I was just like tiktoking then after that suddenly this group of aunties right like I don't know where they came from also tapi tiba-tiba dorang datang tau like this group of like five aunties I think they came then after that uh dorang macam berbual-bual at this area like very near me ah beside this aunty was sitting so I think they were one group
like one big group tapi cuma ada satu tempat duduk so dia duduk lah
ada lima orang then satu aunty tengah duduk jadi agaknya enam lah tu tak tahu I ni macam primary school maths gitu
ya but then jap jap jap jap I haven't belum habis lagi and then right so he halau them already like kesian this aunties you know they just like there talking they tried to adhere to as many rules as possible already they just want to talk you know then uh uh
like they not even like like not wearing not even spitting or anything you just you know speaking you know tengah berbual-berbual jer seh
after that dorang jalan lah maka terpaksa mereka jalan
this aunty who's sitting dia macam tengah macam lengah-lengah lah nak duduk-duduk because baru duduk tau baru duduk
the pakcik came to me
sejak bila aku tak boleh duduk kat kerusi then I'm like
err okay ah okay then I just like perangai sia then after that I I just left lah like my mood no good already lah then the the aunty who was
sitting at the other seat right then she look at me walk I think she wasn't planning to walk but because I walk right then she look at me then she's like aiyo semua also everything also cannot now semua pun tak boleh then I'm like
a'ah nak buat macam mana aunty takpe lah
tak nak kena saman so ya
I'm telling you ah if we don't wear if you never wear mask and someone sampai sekarang eh the one person sneezed and that person is let's say positive eh
liao satu I'm telling you it's gonna have COVID already
ya so it was dah nak kat satu tahun ah oh my god ya sia
wah cepat seh
then after that only because of that kan only sebab uh of this kan then like
dorang punya living conditions got raised up as well which I think is a positive side effect of this I mean I'm not gonna say that it's a good thing but there are some positive side effect is like one of them is like this macam dormitory is only now baru tahu oh dulu kan dorang tinggal then after that I was thinking
cause kalau tak siapa tahu eh like when was the last time you actually lap itu benda punya handle like I don't know ya so I feel like it's a good reset in a sense lah
when when I was like when I use the soap and I wash wash like betul-betul punya wash like scrub scrub you know the eight step gitu kan
be like what she doing why you wash until so clean like but then ada lah aunty yang cute lah cuba ikut juga lah
macam ya but ya now they don't
ya ya ya is like ya I mean that's why I say like I think there's positive side effects also lah I mean it's not a good thing but you know if you think about it another way mm mm ada lah hikmahnya
so macam kadang-kadang like weekly she will ask us lah so how's your COVID situation when we're like oh it's getting better here you know
cause orang tak ikut orang sana tak ikut rule
like it's a law tapi dorang tak enforce sangat
lepas tu selenga I don't know lah I think
have the whole the whole island eh the whole singapore tengah geram dengan dia
check check that one time eh satu kali
it's just that everybody was just wondering macam sejak bila boleh dua belas orang
kalau phase three pun lapan orang jer
mm tapi
in all honesty at least they jujur but actually saya ada dua belas orang lah that time you know even though you might get saman or what but
ya at least dia come clean
kita sejujur-jujurnya eh are we even as careful as we were las time kan
oh my god how macam mana tu
macam gitu eh bilang orang tak payah makan sudah
ya it's basically tak masuk akal
I'm like nak cakap pun fikir sikit ah like
I I think even a secondary school kid boleh fikir that um even kalau macam situational writing eh I wouldn't come up with this
I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was gila seh
ya bila lah boleh travel lagi macam camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
bila time nak makan we can makan or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
what fifty plus lima puluh
sabar sabar sabar he actually did it
pergi pub eh pergi pub hot chocolate wow
eh so was the first time that you felt snow or macam how was it ah macam sejuk gila ke or like how was it
oh okay eh tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk ah I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right macam hot chocolate or like
eh hot chocolate dekat
yup yup correct ah rindu seh tu
yang the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then bila wombat tu macam bau kita punya makanan wah he just like crawled up to our door
ya eh how come tak ambil gambar seh
tu ah kecoh saje
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like kesian when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ah lepas COVID pergi mana eh
dia penat gila ah you have to break and make lots of stops right
ya I really hope this goes away soon seh K tak sabar
you can actually leave your car over there kan macam
so macam like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport ah there was car
tapi rasa macam you macam boring gitu
eh selamat tak seasick eh
weirdly I miss the supermarkets kelakar kan kelakar tak
they are just so lain right
ya lah that's one of our ways that kita nak save duit kan
I don't know I rasa apa dah pakai
err wait err K let me recall eh van diemen's was the one yang kat farm right
and then there was gelato messina which was dekat bandar like the city area
and gelato messina was eh what flavours were there lupa ah
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and macam all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato messina was like hip ah macam modern
so macam um I don't know eh
eh amorino yang mana satu seh
yes yes I remember amorino was the one where they shape the ice cream macam bunga like that macam the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but macam tak memorable sangat ah
uh oh it's a tough one err macam mana eh err
tak I'm sure you like my messina better right
pening seh I tengok
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours ah macam
macam there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good ah that's not something that's easily found here
eh but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so macam you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're lapar like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
borong market okay trying to remember
macam it wasn't it wasn't like popular or macam ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet lah basically
like I remember there was one macam
apa eh flavour ni macam some honeycomb thingy right
pisang goreng is it pisang goreng
macam they said that it was pisang muda goreng or something like that
eh eh mana nak dapat ah
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else lah like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie sebelum tu apa
what's dragon's den tak pernah dengar seh
ini macam shark tank ke apa
oh macam like the article like she published or something eh
miss all the good food seh overseas but I miss um ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas macam masak sendiri and all kan
I do I do like macam
apa eh for example prata probably like we would actually
trying to find a prata shop or teh tarik shop and pay an exorbitant amount untuk beli just to macam
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then kan ya tu ah
entah ah maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than kat sini
kau singapore pun ada seh
what was so nice about it ah was it like the spices or apa apa yang sedap sangat ah
livable boy sama makan sama hidup eh
sedap kan like apa eh what do we have shepherd's pie ah
and then um ya like we shared quite a bit ah we went there I think malam eh
tu ah tak ingat ah
wah rindu gila seh
um let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes kat
sedap kan like
like like I didn't even know something macam so basic and simple can taste so sedap you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait apa what was the filling dalam jacket potato dia lupa ah
ya macam I don't think it was tuna what was it ah just like sour cream eh it was ya something like really simple but remember kita order lepas tu kita order lagi lepas tu ya it was that good ah
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said ah before the freshness of the produce and macam ya things are just
so many things to miss about being overseas apa lah yang kita boleh buat kat singapore sekarang
ya lah that one standard ah standby duit jer
macam ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money lah but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores pasal dia orang suka touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience err like it's over there it's like
yang unbeatable lah and ya you I think
it's not just one brand tapi macam berlambak ah brand
bukan bicester
okay can you jog my memory again york mana satu
okay lah just want to check it out while we are there betul aqilah
so right what eh did we go to any theme parks ah kat sana like I can't remember like during our trip
ya only only that one err that one place ingat tak tempat tu apa tu nama dia
yang ada the one with the that float what do you call it ah
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope apa eh what is it called ah
ya but basically there was that fun huge float kita duduk kat dalam lepas tu we just slide down the slope ya get it is it
ya that was nice and then that was this um eh mahal eh
berapa ah berapa seh
I think kita ada masuk macam some maze thingy right
not not rafting ah lupa ah
oh then kita ada masuk tu haunted house haunted house
kan ada macam tempat I don't know there was this like towards the end of our trip dekat sana then ada this little like haunted house yang kita masuk
kat atas ah like this house of mirrors or something like that
err no ah bondi ah bondi kat australia
cari waterfall ah
cari waterfall we went on a major like waterfall tracking thing in tasmania what
ya it can layer on lagi eh kat dalam forests kena layer on seh
bila seh how come I don't know
ni time uni eh
but err tu ah like last time I never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like I am sure you had to save up to do certain thing I mean macam you've got to plan around your budget and everything kan
jauh gila eh
eh sabar belgium is germany right
oh okay okay and then apa jadi
so wait the cab fare was mahal gila or what
ish rabak or what
eh wait back then you guys had like phones and technology with you right or macam
ke kau orang macam were I don't know just winging it
ada buffer lah
this was towards the end of your trip or macam mana
wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys dah takde duit apa seh
oh faham faham K K and then
did the taxi driver actually buy your alasan
ah so like he kena switched on dia punya meter ah
okay okay no lah because I'm just wondering macam you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
confirm tengah panic eh pasal macam dah lah lambat then you have to find your gate and everything like oh my goodness
macam macam what what would err the like significant moments of the trip
oh selamat ah spain menang
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like habis
people will probably be like maki-maki semua
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm ah kena jalan balik kan
serious eh roti and tuna everyday okay I don't think I can do that
prata eh
prata is everywhere
wait wait wait sabar sabar kau orang dah check harga benda tu ke belum
okay okay habis
alright alright alright so you guys were like itik dengan ayam ah berbual
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like prata bom ah so kirakan dia ada macam
but as in they served it on the side or memang it's it's really like with the sugar and all
oh my so he gave you guys one first or macam mana
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the manis one oh okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there lah
so what siesta time basically macam nap time lunch time nap eh
kalau dia orang ada siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay lah then that's not so bad lah
masih ah madrid
he pernah kerja at malaysia or singapore is it
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large macam like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
oh but how did you find out about your ni the circles outside of your school
ya yang birthday surprise
tak salah pe
I mean like dah dah berbual sampai one one plus
so he and his girlfriend dah kat situ then me and my other guy friend
some Marvel Marvel punya like
uh what else I forgot lah what else ada kat dia punya package yesterday I I read together with them then ya lah
you know like my birthday that time macam
is a company yang buat
so this one we do our own ah like small picnic mat some food very macam
that day punya is not bad cause it's a bit intimate in a way right
so the the the macam deciding factor is
if the birthday boy bawa motor ke tak
and my guy friend ni yang the non-birthday guy
dapat kereta ke tak he can drive what okay our intention is we we we told the girlfriend ah eh like
you you ask him lah go out for once tak yah bawa motor then I say but
because ya he then I say you use lah the excuse kalau pergi Sentosa like
parking mahal then he say but can park at the Seah Seah Im eh he always park there
boleh pass ah
because he did say he did say that uh she did macam bilang dia
my other guy friend cannot get a car kereta bapa dia
what's the plan ah sudah lupa
ah actually if you ask me frankly I prefer kalau pergi Marina Barrage
because dah dekat dengan kedai makan
just just so that macam tak waste time on the road I feel lah
from the other guy he feels that kan macam meriah kalau dalam kereta semua if he tak bawa motor
I I lazy lah go through all that apa monorail eh
okay if we go Sentosa we must start like lepas zohor lah that kind
ya but then he has class ngaji so
ya so need to wait he finish ngaji by the time like two already then nak travel all the way to Sentosa three plus
kita kita nya more like museum attraction kind
uh apa eh
the girlfriend say ah sometimes he like penat from so he
then I'm like kalau he penat like you know
he dah biasa buat
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay uh apa you wouldn't believe it we wanna go Tampines hub also naik motor
even though it's like dekat gila
no lapan ratus lebih
to naik motor lah so cannot stop him
so if if he still macam go for ngaji then most likely is Marina Barrage ah cause
macam we won't be able to enjoy the attraction as much cause we'll be rushing
dia by six sudah tutup I think
okay the guy wants to get Butter Studio cake he wants to pay so you know let him be biar lah
you know the kedai makan dekat sebelah
I've never eaten there right so I ask him agak agak berapa ah kena bayar like how much is the
korang korang makan apa sia dorang beli banyak ah all guys
then she's like eh then I then I told her lah macam
worse come to worst aku beli air jer ah
then she was like kesiannya datang jauh jauh minum air jer
yeah I mean if there's simple food like nasi goreng mi goreng I'll buy lah
ah like this type ah macam shell out eh I feel
yeah macam I don't
to be very honest right I always dread everytime people ask me out to eat then they ask uh mana kau nak makan ah
point ah I will tell them takut like penuh
uh I did say if we go Sentosa tak ya gi Marina Barrage Vivocity area ada pe then he was like tak nak nak makan restaurant atas sikit
Vivo uh that's what I thought hmm then dorang kata apa nak makan apa Mac then I'm like
kenal us lah cause she knows like
ya and she's not like malu malu dengan kita
she she was the one she was the one who said eh korang nak jumpa for dinner tak a few days ago then I was like
nak discuss about this lah
yeah then I was like masa tu I busy
uh we were in the same class tapi kita ada different clique
ah subset ah dia macam
abeh ada smaller group
hari raya ah hmm
the the guy tak suka the same person I don't like
the other guy also don't like tapi dia pandai bermuka
so sometimes raya also he never come then I a bit sad lah cause like I mean like I close with them what then only me and the other guy ada
ya no loss then he say it's okay uh I will go to your house for raya with the other guy lah just the three of us I'm like okay
ya I think hari raya is the only time that whole big group meet
Arshad say in the group uh apa apa kau kalau tak pergi then kita tak nak pergi ah
just go anyway I also bajet lah I spend
ni nak keluar for the birthday anyway I want to spend money right
I also macam don't feel like how I would feel last time I'll be sad if I never I cannot make it you know
I said that then then the the other girls they alah uh apa you never go then macam boring ah
kalau pergi lima orang then that one person won't have a pair if you take rides
no tak pernah pergi
macam company just another person
tapi three three people is still not bad
I told you what dorang kena kena buang kerja
the blue one the kaki tangling
yesterday ah the girlfriend was telling me kau dah naik yang merah
take lah try taking the apa blue one
this is just before you went umrah
it's just before you went umrah
Aisha aku takut Aisha aku takut
ya I told her that then she's like tak betul lah
oh ya I haven't reply ni
cannot tangguh anymore
semalam oh after we talk about the birthday thing we talk about like other things also lah
then she a bit malu ah and then she was like korang tau eh we we know everything
they uh he saw her in school but he wants to kenal kenal with her right
you know you know the line that guy like uh apa guys like to use or like they ah basically he said uh dia the girl that eh hari tu I saw you at
apa macam like oh bazaar Geylang masa tu bulan puasa
that day I saw you at bazaar ramadhan because he saw the stories lah
padahal he wasn't even there he wasn't even there I saw you at bazaar ramadhan uh wanted to tegur but you look
why what makes you why why do you think he lurus bendul
last time he used to be a bit panas baran if he don't like someone
so that he's not afraid to macam confide to you anytime right
uh are you okay then I'm like off the damn uh apa
tak lah it's a bit it's just like
yeah so dia punya like plastic
it's just a drill dia cakap gitu he would expect something to go wrong on another machine not a drill
no but sec two lower sec uh cannot enter ini kan
I know what is that that one primary school ada
I've never kena detention
I mean almost kena detention I think once
macam so he he walked in front of the discipline master and talk so she won't turn around right
oh I told you Humaira punya story
number one err it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very macam like uh abang why you asking for my name no ah upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in err
that's why lah but of course there's that connotation lah kan tapi it's not it's not really
so ah dia suka dia suka in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here abah was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got zina to sit right beside me
ah that one I didn't get to ask but that one is tak tak important lah ya
so the other ah important part was about his job experience lah so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain lah actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he apa the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and abah were very calm about it tak ada macam problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that eh
ah so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was ah number one ah apa there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then dia tinggal pasir ris
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale lah because they want to look for some a place near err istighfar
because dekat um the parents place pasir ris
this is this could have been boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik lah kan which is to
bilang kan that you want to um do this to both your parents and zina's parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that err the keys you know then what you have to actually this part abah was the one who ah already point out I just reiterated the point
nanti kan macam terdesak kan you have to like actually have to push for this ah then you are making it difficult for both sides
ah then he just he just nodded lah he he understood uh but I was still macam thinking eh do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here ah but I think it's in between lah it's in between that apologetic but also macam like okay
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel what begitu I say it's not about that lah it's about you informing do it properly
ah then I then I also talk to them lah like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan abah also want to hear what is his apa dia punya rancangan lah
um then it was very clear rancangan is that
the next year somewhere dalam march they intend to tunang dengan zina
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet abah probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement lah
the nikah would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least ada
ah then okay then at least say that gives proper time lah for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the abah was saying you know zina just got
err just finish studying jadi apa the plan in these two years for for her uh then this azram cakap oh ya uh this is to would be
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about macam like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me zina also needs to work to build up a
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why macam it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple tak payah tak ada complication
and I and I pun cakap dengan dia lah that
you nak kena
dia zina pun nak kena grow up
asing asing asing masing-masing kena grow up tersendiri
ah so you need give that time untuk you both nak kena grow up ah that's the thing budak itu diam jer so I tak puas hati because like you can just be numb about this whole thing lah that is a which is uh quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that abah is there something you want to uh anything you want to ask them uh I said ya so ah let me check in um so
so one thing that I brought out is you both nak kena
tersendiri grow
memang ah nak kena apa ada this uh
grow up right memang nak kena ada grow up tapi uh growing up needs to needs perlu berada dalam
ah context apa
maksud dia has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that uh growing up takes place both lah during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this ah so I made it very clear that don't just lip service dia perlu perbincangan further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate abah dengar ini tak mahu communicate communicate like tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa abah there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so um I think they got it lah so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
kau orang nak kena sit down nak kena plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say ah ya lah grow grow grow but you just gonna
tak work on it you just gonna macam letak kat tepi jer and just macam put it into the back of your mind tak nak macam
apa buat kerja develop this it's not gonna work
of course I'm not macam blind to this ah
because at the end itu mama dekat kitchen and mm mama malu malu lah apa lah nanti bila kita duduk makan baru mama duduk
dayah tak ada dayah said she doesn't want to be there also lah
I didn't say sembunyi-sembunyi lah I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
body gesture and how he interact with zina he is very firm he's just firm lah it's that not say very firm lah but it's firm macam whatever zina macam nak nak tanya ah ashraf right do you want water then he will just say
very macam he won't just he won't say oh it's okay zina he he won't
so I can see ah and the way he speaks also is macam very direct and very
ya so it's not macam so as as ambiguous as it was lah at least it's kind of macam very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to ah give zina time to work ah give zina time to develop
kita tak tanya pasal dia punya family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
changi business apa changi ah ya that one ya that one warehouse lah ya so
dia macam ya macam I I don't know that
so jadi macam
then abah abah is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that abah like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay abah is comfortable with him already
ah that's something that they will have to macam resolve lah how but at the very least they are giving zina time to grow
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been ah apa been attached to for the three months
ah it was okay normal not not that macam overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that ah the past uh he has yet to have the chance to go for jumaat players
ever since COVID like macam basically he's just trying to share lah like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like macam he just brought up we were talking about jumaat prayers and then we were sharing
ya tak payah macam pening-pening sangat
ah actually after that was a lot more interest lepas itu lagi interesting
was abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir ah ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah
ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik ah ah lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik
tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena kan then I said abah
abah nak kena tengok eh
hidayah okay you you got two different daughters abah cakap apa different both are daughter yes both are your daughters tapi there are two different girls two different daughters
zina is on the receiving end she is zina sudah memang nak menerima
apa berkahwin hidayah I don't think she is there yet dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu
then zina pun add in ah ya but she says she wants to get married ya memang dia nak tapi is she proactive looking no what she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors uh
then uh then I said so abah you need to understand yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan
so abah kena recognize that and dayah is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say abah macam habis kita then I say okay yes I know I I faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana now bila habis sampai bila abah kata
then abah let me give you some advice
if you nak di to even
abah err mama bila nak
calonkan or menunjukkan calon
biar quality
biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada quality dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik of course sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam give up dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah just throw jer ya then mama say tapi the one yang dekat australia itu abah mama tahu tak he is just a taxi driver then dayah will think macam macam bingit lah
because he actually err apa he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to sewakan rumah ini so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
itu lah yang aku cakap
that's why I say cari orang berkualiti berkualiti is not just about
ya so anyway jadi macam
abah understood that lah I said abah tak boleh control apa dayah nak ini
abah boleh control kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh control itu itu yang abah boleh control
so I said right now it seem that dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan fine tapi cari berkualiti this if people are not are ada quality and I said pada abah it's not about social status it's not about macam kaya tak kaya ya it's about the dia nak kena match ah
jadi budak ini dengan dayah are two different people so cannot
then membina diri sendiri eh macam mana
ah lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina
tak boleh zina cakap ah ya ya okay I will look at it lah abang ya
dia cakap abang lah okay
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said oh I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know uh semalam that err you you are ashraf then I was thinking okay how is it macam mana dia akan menerima ini ah cara eh
zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku like
nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama I don't know lah but then lepas itu dia tanya err abang your name is salim is it ah yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me abang ah like if macam dia satay ada banyak ya then abang also can bring back the
so I thought err ya that's why it was easy lah macam abang pun cakap and because like I said
I told ashraf that I'm appreciative yang dia terus terang dia
ada apa ada wawasan lah ah
lepas itu abang pun cakap ah yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak clear ah habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini
encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini ah
okay lah I thought macam the
macam mana it went through was good lah ya
ah azlina azlina need to macam grow up lah on this
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're macam like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has lah correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what ashraf has did did you see or not how ashraf did it
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi
kan daddy cerita senang then I say isn't it simple so that macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru
ah you just have to be upfront jer kan senang and ya lah ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
aku cakap dengan dia yang easy-going dengan being firm
during the discussion dengan ashraf I was saying zina
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study mm ah ashraf dengar jer lah what he want to say he just mm mm
mm but whatever it is he is already macam he never macam like show the reaction of macam you know or he didn't show it lah of being tak nak tak nak apa oh like shock or what I think he knows ah what he's getting into with zina
ya lah I agree of course that's why I said they both tersendiri nak kena grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed tersendiri
if if kalau izat buat gitu then I will tell him off lah eh kau kenal dia ke tak kan kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa so we have to be we have to take this step kita kena uh apa kita mesti
ambil uh
kegiatan begini ah tak boleh macam ah
tak boleh macam apa ambil scenario jer
I faham
no lah dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan no
I was two zero abah open this topic about dayah then I was asking zina zina what have you been talking to dayah lah about dayah's like err relationship or a'ah zina cakap no we don't talk each other huh
sekarang dua-dua sudah try kan
dua-dua sudah try
tak boleh kan so you tell me apa nak kena buat sekarang
nak buat apa sekarang then dia sudah ah ya try again lah try no
sudah try sudah sekarang kan tak boleh kan so nak kena buat apa
do what you want me to tell you the answer takkan lah I have to give you the answer
why you must have the jawapan for me
I want to hear from your own mulut
and then dia cakap ya then kita nak kena ask someone to help ah then siapa this someone to help
kenapa it has to be me to ask you to
you know abang salim kita ada problem
okay just kind of macam jumpa
see things eye to eye tak boleh macam bersefahaman
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why zina kalau if this were the reverse that let's say you and zina you and dayah
macam mana pun that has happen ah izat would still come and apologize to me
then you did zina was saying macam like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to izat
macam like life lah about children about
apa marriage like that that
lah macam ya lah macam like how how he uh apa decided to get married with with salimah then ya we have ya before even during during apa
during ah our apa being after being married also we still talk about macam certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not macam pen pals is not like macam like the way I would talk to faris for example but
macam at least macam things things about personal things I still can talk to him macam I can easily talk to him macam eh izat kau tengok macam ah macam dayah is like I I can have the conversation with izat you know ya I can but macam
dayah and zina will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that macam
no lah not really enstranged like even after this one I I have macam move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise dulu lagi tak boleh apologise pun dia punya ego is so big
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to macam make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms hidayah and zina is different they are just happy with being ignored
dayah zina sudah give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring hidiyah
that's how bad it is ah so at least me and izat kalau kita disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like izat macam has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that macam he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not macam um tak nak berbual dengan si salim no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he macam best character he needs to learn to work it out
kita semua memang have your own areas of growth but
dayah and zina is like they just ignore the problem then I say zina especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi kan lagi kau orang lagi will be more separated
you and dayah ready have a problem bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi what do you think
this passive aggressiveness tak boleh tak boleh ah
and not just macam like ah tak apa no it's not tak apa
ya I I did I did macam tell her lah that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that uh
you nak kena
fikir how
this is important this memang mustahak
you cannot just macam biarkan that this issue err to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
ah first you have to you setuju if you setuju
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak then
jadi it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem masalah yang dia ada ini is trust issues hidayah doesn't trust her because hidayah feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what zina has trust issues because things dayah is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you ah so that's why lah trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts ah so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
tak boleh ah it's just not healthy and you cannot just
biarkan macam gitu jer
mama abah just listen so good thing was
mama abah willing to hear
mm kenapa
zina was uh no I uh zina was saying that she was um the reason why apa she went on to telling izat first because she felt more comfortable talking to izat
then she she sudah bingit lah bila kena rubbish then she walk off
she she kena already lah then she walk off
then say ya of recent years it has been the case ah that's that's the part I said ah rubbish then stop it since when then she already sudah kena then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it lah macam like eh mana wah you are the
so going back to yang tadi kan we were talking about zina and dayah and I was asking zina who do you think you
jadi sebab dia kena tengok and understand that this is the situation
and zina sit down together then they can iron this out lah macam
they just don't see the point in macam making sure that they are
true lah dia tak boleh macam just simply you know say that oh this is a one time deal mesti lah dia ingat
ya so obviously it takes steps lah it's not macam I one time can boleh boleh
akak kakak last kerja kat mana
okay kak okay kalau kalau kerja kat situ kan apa yang akak pelajari
jadi kiranya kakak telah belajar lah daripada incident tu
okay kakak sekarang mempunyai um experience experience di dalam bahagian industri baking um kalau kakak diberi pilihan untuk mencuba industry yang lain industri apakah yang kakak mahu cuba
apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar uh kanak-kanak yang kecil
kira kakak tahu kan yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak have the skills untuk cope with this problem
dengan adanya technologies sebagai telefon bimbit dan tablet adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda
kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita around ten years old ke eight years old gitu bila tak ada komputer semua or bila takde handphone kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita time kecil
kakak ingat tak dulu beza eh sebab dulu kita takde netflix takde youtube kita cuma tengok live and live kadang-kadang if you want to go to the toilet nak kena tunggu advertisement
then remember last time you have to apa nak kena rush the toilet kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat
sekarang senang jer now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it kan like how did we survive last time like kalau you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit susah tapi like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
like there's only one computer in the house then kalau if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so kakak remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way macam
and the thing is I feel like the weak part of the hotel that was the because the was like old kind of like remember our old the the one at rumah lama that kind of like the controls are very different but what what was important at the end of the day I brought my four
orang kaya kan bagus nak jadi nak jadi kaya-raya
boleh tolong mak bapa sekarang kan pembelanjaan kan banyak that's why I need a lot of money lah and
furthermore now my age is already dah tiga puluh lebih tahun
so I will need the income the additional money to support my mum lah and my dad ni semua
oh ya lagi dua wish okay lagi dua wish is mula-mula nak jadi orang kaya selepas tu nak jadi orang yang kurus
cause I am right now I'm my weight is about one one two so I'm quite fat lah and dulu-dulu kan I was actually um eighty kilo only I was quite fit lah go to gym one week four times
per day I mean four times a week I do all kinds of exercise even at one point in time I even had a abs lah kirakan dua pack ke
empat pack punya abs lah kirakan dah tu I also last time belajar karate judo belajar mixed martial arts semua
cuma sekarang jer lah dah apa tu dah kerja kan jadi pun dah malas
um lepas kaya sihat okay err since my age now is tiga puluh dua tahun I'm just waiting for three more years lah then I wish that I can buy my own I don't want to buy private cause the maintenance tinggi sangat
so I just want to buy itu pun kalau boleh empat bilik lima bilik ataupun masionette lah mana yang I mampu why
cause kalau beli rumah besar sikit boleh rental income so I can meet one of the agent yang I kenal which is my friend lah
ask them for advice so they can help me lah um tolong cari kalau boleh pun nak nak beli rumah dekat-dekat dengan hospital ataupun dekat-dekat dengan any healthcare punya tempat macam polyclinic or what why
cause kalau kita pindah dekat situ I mean kalau kita ada rumah kat situ
kita boleh rental kan rumah dengan nurse nurse lah lagipun nurse gaji kan okay boleh tahan so kirakan kita boleh earn quite a lot from that rental income ah kirakan ah itu saja lah yang my three wishes lah very realistic punya wish ah cause kalau kita wish merepek pun I mean uh bukannya boleh mencapai kan so I will always wish on things that I can achieve I can confirm I can achieve
okay lah kalau if I have any superpowers out of the three right
hmm superpowers eh err superpowers what are the three eh apa best eh mm
tengok gambar avengers
superpowers ah jadi thor ah
thor best ah thor thor is the god of thunder dia boleh pergi to a different realm boleh pergi space boleh pergi sana sini
thor pun kuat kan dia punya ada hammer dia lah hammer ada dua macam macam hammer lah
abeh lepas tu dia boleh pergi mana dia nak pergi he's the strongest ah actually but then there's also another one strongest which is also my choice is a
captain marvel I know that captain marvel is a lady lah but uh actually kalau you can make it into a man punya character pun bagus juga
so it's basically the strongest avengers in all the avengers even thanos pun kalah okay there's one more is I like to be the witch ah a witch
from also from avengers kenapa
cause yang time kita tengok end games tu actually kalau
thanos dia tak panggil ah apa tu dengan dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia who make it link it's actually witch tu witch tu yang akan kalahkan dia lah cause he's already
on the verge of losing bila bila kalah rabak ah but then cause he asked the dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia untuk bring down the ring
so all the yang spaceship besar punya cannon tu kena tembak jer rabak ah kena that's the three superhero that I want
hulk no cause hulk dia besar sangat actually kalau tinggal dekat singapore nak jadi hulk aduh
sebab tu kat singapore kalau nak beli kereta pun jangan beli kereta besar beli kereta kecil sudah kalau beli kereta besar kereta punya parking pun bukannya besar-besar pun
yang parking lama lagi halus-halus jer nak pergi sana sini aduh nak belok jer nak u-turn jer leceh
kita punya roads actually very very small so it's the best kalau
even your body jangan lah jadi macam bodybuilder have a small physique lah kirakan angan badan besar-besar sangat
meal tu apa makan apa-apa ah
ah until now I pernah makan
itu that is very memorable apasal
itu whale meat yang paling mahal sekali
actually dia punya whale meat dia dia potong kecil-kecil tipis-tipis jer dia potong
lepas tu dia suruh kita makan dengan ramen ramen
dia punya japanese version punya ramen lah then kita makan
selepas tu first I thought macam dia punya dia punya portion dia is quite big tau besar tapi sikit sikit nah dia kasih too little
oh it's cooked it's cooked I know it's cooked cause uh it's not sashimi usually orang jepun kalau kasih sashimi dia akan letak dekat a different plate
but this one is cooked uh but not like deep fry punya cook lah macam I think steam or what lah cause
dia letak on top of the ramen itself so we must eat along on the ramen dengan dia punya
condiments ah basically dengan dia punya seaweed semua lah
ya that is actually it's not the nicest food that I've eaten but it is actually um the most unique lah paling unique sekali and dia punya
restaurant is actually located outside meiji shrine ah yang pasal halal
tak halal tu actually I got one guy friend who actually he checked the stall and one good thing about japanese punya
restaurant kan once they sell the seafood they won't sell anything else macam
babi or any uh meat stuff lah even ayam ke daging ke apa so once they sell barang
seafood is purely hundred percent just barang seafood jer
okay okay yang itu paling best okay yang dia punya whale bila makan it's eh dia punya potong slice very thin and small so when I I just cut bits by bits then every little bits
lah put inside my mouth it just melts dia kira macam makan butter gitu cuma rasa dia is bukan butter rasa dia is lemak tapi bukan lemak macam
kambing ke lemak ah no tau it's just lemak
but you just taste the sea water so kirakan
lemak ikan and whale punya lemak is really one of a kind ah it's really wah if
kalau awak pernah makan macam sea urchin ke apa ah macam gitu I already eaten a sea urchin before also
and to me it's quite common but the whale meat the whale fats on meat itu itu yang very very very unique
ah tak pasti isi or fats
but uh mostly it's I think fats ah cause kalau isi whale kan is a tough kan
so it won't melt in your mouth but mostly if it's the fats of the whale any fats yang kita makan masuk dalam mulut even fats kambing
ke lembu ke apa masuk dalam mulut mesti melts in the mouth
ah so that is the thing and lagipun dia punya I think dia potong tipis-tipis lah so I can't really
actually takde yang okay compare japan korea lah kita jangan cakap pasal thailand
thailand is dia punya makan just semuanya pedas-pedas jer
uh japan boleh tahan uh but japan punya makan is betul-betul
yang betul-betul tekak orang melayu is you know what um makanan korea
cause makanan korea even dia punya mee hitam tu yang
orang tengok tak sedap tapi orang cakap makan sedap yang mee hitam tu dia punya rasa exactly the same as kita punya mee rebus
yes jajangmyeon cause kita punya mee rebus semua the difference is jajangmyeon is macam dia macam basah-basah
dia tak ada kuah tapi kita mee rebus ada kuah tapi dia punya rasa exactly the same macam kita punya mee rebus punya kuah and of course kita punya mee rebus lagi sedap cause why kita punya mee rebus kita ada letak limau kasturi
and ada telur ada apa so dia orang punya is a mixture of japanese
punya taste bud dengan mix with into mee rebus punya rasa that's what I think
for korean dishes that is quite unique lah quite unique tapi yang I really like about korea is dia punya daging bulgogi
itu I can eat everyday I can eat breakfast lunch dinner dia punya daging bulgogi dia makan dengan nasi panas-panas enough ialah cukup
cause pasal pasal daging bulgogi dia is macam makan daging dendeng tapi daging dendeng dia berminyak sangat tapi itu bulgogi tu you imagine macam daging dendeng cuma dah hancur-hancurkan
they shred into pieces and actually they cook in a hotplate fuh lepas tu makan dengan nasi
nasi biasa nasi panas-panas eh steam rice ke apa
sedap you can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner you can eat it everyday
you takkan rasa jelak I mean according to my taste lah cause I really like the daging bulgogi
yes I've tried wagyu beef yang halal punya actually we have
until apa tu um A three ke A two usually halal punya wagyu beef there's no A five yang tak halal punya iya yang A five cause um
yang halal punya is actually err it's only made in australia
yang the non-halal one is all made in originally from japan itself lah yang halal punya is only made in australia and australia usually their A is they can't reach the A five punya punya apa tu punya punya grading
the the wagyu beef is actually made in japan cause there is this certain part of japan yang yang ah
the essence of wagyu beef ah yang banyak marbling it's also I heard there's also a
for the wagyu beef punya itu ah market
so only in japan then you get the really the grade A five yang paling tinggi punya yang paling mahal punya the rest of it is a usually um
tak uh no
the rest of it is always comes from australia australia punya is uh dia punya grade not that high lah but dia punya rasa okay lah actually okay lah the thing about
uh wagyu beef is just that dia punya lemak jer
yang if you if you really notice kan dia punya yang urat-urat tu is actually fats
so even the the normal fats the lemak fats is the same
what makes it different is that orang jepun ni dia punya wagyu beef dia suka potong raw
makan macam apa tu the sashimi eh then they cut raw slice very thin pieces then what they want is that umami effect basically once you cut thin pieces you put it in your mouth it melts then
ada itu umami punya effect umami effect is exactly like how you
eat macam uh apa tu
ajinomoto dia that that kind of effect that kind of taste that's what they chase for the wagyu beef
uh dia punya lemak-lemak dia
oh like I say just now lah I only eat bulgogi cause that's to me is the best of the best paling sedap
the bulgogi is really my got to lah I've eaten orang makan thailand makan indonesia melayu semua I just like bulgogi cause bulgogi pun kira macam-macam tau a different part of korea yang halal punya they make different type of bulgogi the one that I really like is the budak-budak yang bikin kat
that hill daripada bawah sampai kat atas semua
makanan halal from singapore from malaysia
turkey negeri arab semua ada so at the top of the hill is actually a mosque nama dia
oh tak apa-apa nama dia is is not it's a adalah I kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
okay cause dia pun macam road kan so you go down on the other side you go down a bit
you will find this small macam
err macam mana eh you know like those kind of arab street punya shophouses you go ah
macam gitu you go then adalah dekat situ ah actually yang masaknya budak-budak perempuan melayu
a lot of them and also there are other specialty kan it's actually ayam rebus and dia punya ayam it's actually they take the whole
macam spring chicken dia kasih steam itu benda
and dia rebus kat dalam the chicken soup the chicken broth wah then they they just ah basically
dia tak potong tak apa the steamed chicken tu they just give you in a big pot then they give you a one
ah apa tu one bowl of rice
fuh makan sedap ah actually during winter makan tu is the best ah
not really winter lah it's quite cold but not really winter yang I went to japan is I went there when it was winter and in japan
dalam minus
twelve ah minus twelve yang paling sejuk ah lepas tu yang paling best kan kat japan on the new year's day new year's day pagi-pagi bangun
from the apartment I play with the snow for I mean dia punya snow dia punya snow is tak banyak must wait for the night time then we go to the
ah kalau you go cause tokyo kan is bandar kan so all the snow will melt in the concrete so basically you need to go to the park then
the snow will be at you know at the fields dekat yang pokok-pokok ah then you can take the snow from there
err truthfully okay for long term wise I prefer singapore punya weather cause singapore punya weather you can only expect two
punya weather lah like uh autumn
uh apa tu spring lah winter
livelihood lah I mean tengok kita tinggal dekat rumah berapa besar lah rumah kita then lepas tu kita punya kain baju untuk weather singapore sendiri dah
dah banyak apa lagi kalau imagine kita kena simpan for
winter clothings lain
autumn clothings lain
spring clothings lain summer clothings lain so we will ah take up more space and for a small country like singapore with our small houses right I don't think that's ideal lah that is for me lah but unless it's ah you are
talking about we are living in japan negeri dia besar even in japan when I went there I actually I checked out the houses there dia punya rumah sana
murah-murah and actually it's freehold tau it's not macam kita lease
ninety nine years is freehold rumah dia is actually very affordable
kita punya rumah three room you can buy a very big bungalow sized punya rumah in japan freehold
punya scenery cause japan is very mountainous
so I've been to the neighbourhood area macam kita punya
tempat lah hougang ang mo kio
kita punya you turn left you turn right all you see are flats right kalau dekat jepun you go to that kind of a
urban area it's not really urban ah it's macam dia punya heartland ah kira
is all rumah dia is all uh rumah bungalow bungalow bungalow
lepas tu yang ada tempat ada gate yang ada tempat tak ada gate but mostly tempat dia orang is there's no gate so their communals spirit is very strong and in
dia punya village dia is actually a farm
dia akan farm is actually itu farm dia uh jepun punya beras kan lain kan so basically all the villagers dia akan um
apa tu have this small mini farms that is actually when I asked the people there they say by right throughout history right that small farm is enough to
to sustain the whole village by right ah until modernization come lah but that farm itself right untuk kalau
nasi basic punya nasi is actually more than enough to feed the whole
so even until now also there are still people but not young people lah the old people ah dia orang tua-tua yang ah mend
the small farms in japan so basically when they mend the small farms right um yang paling best kita orang tourist they let they let us enter
cause dia orang yang kalau boleh berbual bahasa jepun
dia orang will be more receptive than people who can't speak japanese
can't speak japanese you can only speak english yang
the older generation so only younger generation can speak english but their english pun is actually
broken english it's not really full uh punya english the language that we learn um from our
oh budak-budak singapore kita punya english is one of the highest grade lah kirakan kita yang paling pandai dalam bahasa english in all of asian punya country even if you go to like
russia even china you know apatah lagi malaysia indonesia ni semua their english level dengan budak singapore punya level
is really macam langit dengan bumi lain
oh tak for japan tak uh it depends on where you go kalau itu tempat is betul-betul hundred percent muslims okay usually macam gini even if you go
to any other country macam thailand even bali or what kan kalau if you go to a halal restaurant
there is owned by indians or arabs yes they will have a dua dapur
one dapur is for the halal the other dapur is actually is for their alcohol
beverages so they ada dua dapur for those pure
muslims usually yang macam if you go japan is those
orang kita cakap mualaf ah orang jepun mualaf ke apa ah they are muslims born and bred muslims in japan they will have hundred percent halal then they have the dia punya sign is also not the normal halal sign it's from actually kalau macam kita punya singapore ada MUIS
ah so they also have their own punya MUIS lah dekat in japan so basically even for korea also the same thing
for koreans if you go to those uh restaurants yang mend by all those arabs or indians yes they have a mixture
for muslims also cause they are in the tourists area and I think dia punya rental dia punya duit
sewa dia every month is very expensive so they need to cover lah they need to be smart in business there in order
for them to survive mm korea jepun all the same even bali even thailand all the same but if you
meet their pure locals or pure muslims then confirm chop dia punya area
that's how they live their life I mean untuk kita kalau macam extra was-was kita jangan makan but you must we must know that there is actually two dapur
it's not one dapur they make they mix everything together no no no two different dapur
actually they yang the alcohol pun it's not really dapur lah it's just macam a bar just a bar place
err cause I'm still young now thirty two I would rather eat tasty ah but since kita pun dah ada banyak options sekarang so mm
uh what I know is that no matter how healthy the food you eat right don't eat too much lah kalau macam dia cakap buah avocado is good for your heart
don't eat avocado everyday nanti you get other complications when you get when you eat benda yang is too good everyday is no good if you search
there's this guru from india he say garlic is the best uh medicine garlic is the best natural medicine but if you eat garlic everyday you will have adverse effect to you body so basically garlic is actually a very strong
uh have very strong medicinal properties under ayurvedic punya uh cara perubatan really a lot so
in at in fact in all their ayurvedic punya treatment they all use garlic
itu aje the most the most healthiest yang I eat
apa-apa skills lah is it the the the
hardware dengan software punya skills okay basically skills right what I want skills from your beginning of the questions you ask me
whether nak jadi apa I say I nak jadi kaya kan so
cause if you can build all that is a instant money making machine ah you dah tak payah susah-susah nak kerja eight to five
or kerja shift or whatever
untuk cari nafkah you straightaway have an app
cause sekarang banyak budak-budak muda semua they
but what thing one thing they lack is actually a a product and product especially in negeri macam kita ni singapore we don't
produce any product but what we have is skill cause kita punya negeri ah is the hub for education so if we have the right skills kita boleh bikin product from that skill
I suka makan so I kalau boleh skill untuk memasak memasak macam-macam masak um but one thing eh kalau I suka masak I don't like to
masak a fusion style cause why
if you eat in malayan food council before dia punya barang mahal-mahal portion besar yes dia punya cara tempat duduk pun macam very posh
tetapi their fusion food macam betul-betul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu even dengan tekak orang putih they don't like cause um when you
fusion western dengan asian punya makanan
uh I haven't I have not eaten in any of the restaurants yang ada makanan fusion yang betul-betul
err how to say ada dia punya rasa dia is you can actually you can want to go there again lah
ya you just go there for the one time or you just go there for a an event macam birthday ke kawan-kawan nak celebrate birthday promotions ke ah probably
sekali-sekala macam gitu dah but for
even if you have a lot of skills right but if your skill cannot make money untuk apa kan
oh ya uh the last skill eh I have eh okay basically for me eh I daripada kecil daripada menengah dua dah start belajar karate lah
uh I really want to have that kind of skill untuk
any martial art skill but I want to be very good at it macam example karate
ah judo ataupun mixed martial art but mixed martial art is very cliche very vague
karate under okinawan punya style
and okinawan punya style is actually the original punya karate lah which is actually
in fact yang karate yang
orang jepun practice is actually fake
cause orang jepun punya karate
is a is totally different it's not the original karate it's all about orang jepun it's all about perfection
so if you go to a japanese punya karate
it's called nama dia bukan karate nama dia karate-do
do dalam bahasa jepun is a way of life even judo
all the do yang kat belakang semua is actually maksud orang jepun
is a way of life so orang jepun is more on to the perfectionism
tapi if you really learn the original okinawan punya style it's more of the
the relax orang okinawa actually belajar karate like even
kalau awak awak belajar okinawa punya karate kan
even if you come late the the orang the instructor tu can actually still accept you but for orang jepun punya karate
so untuk orang okinawa punya karate is actually untuk orang malas-malas err like myself
actually orang okay the main difference between okinawa punya karate dengan japanese punya karate is this orang jepun punya karate they learn every time they fight they will learn
how to oo oo dia kira itu dia punya how they breathe is how they get their strengths is by uh contracting I think it's contract or expand okay I think ah orang jepun punya karate is by contracting their body
untuk kasih badan dia tense
uh cause untuk dia orang what they learn from
aikido judo ni semua if you
um you can practise the real okinawan punya punya martial arts ah punya ni karate cause even
dia they call this macam kita ah nama dia bunga-bunga lah kita punya silat bunga-bunga
err orang jepun pun ada cuma orang jepun
punya is a
nama dia kata kata
so kirakan okinawan punya kata is actually more
practical tapi orang jepun punya kata is actually very short and sweet cause like I say again they focus mainly on perfectionism
they don't uh focus about dia punya feel
actually ini karate ni semua eh it's actually about the feel
so if actually if you ask a budak yang belajar okinawan karate dengan japanese karate if they were to spar
hundred percent confirm budak okinawa they will win cause orang jepun they also learn kata but dia punya kata and karate dia they do not know how to apply it to real life
self defence they don't know cause untuk orang
korea punya
orang korea punya the way they fight bila when they practise
but orang jepun dia punya kata
the stands dia punya kuda-kuda dia is
so example if you fight one guy he like to fight long distance another guy is meant actually the original punya martial arts fight is for
you ask them to fight each other yang long distance they will definitely lose
cause once the okinawan punya orang
come close to japanese punya
karate punya budak
dia akan blur dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin
okinawan punya karate will always win japanese punya karate
but the big but eh orang okinawa even though they are more relax dia punya gym you can come late all this kind of thing right
okinawa punya karate kan every class only maximum ten to fifteen people yang belajar
ah dia punya guru dia they don't like to take a lot of people so that's why okinawan punya karate lama-lama is dying out
but japanese punya karate-do
is they are they are how to say being trained in a mass level so basically in every class ada dalam hundred people
two hundred people tiga ratus orang belajar in actually in any one class any one time so what the whole world know about
karate is mostly japanese punya karate-do
ah and also in ah in japan punya karate-do
but by right the original karate yang from okinawan one
that is the true essence of okinawan punya karate
ah tu
bezanya it's actually there's a lot of difference ah you can talk
three days three nights eh tiga hari tiga malam boleh
berbual pasal ni tak habis-habis cause it's actually the punya cerita is very interesting
apa eh
okay for singapore context eh aku nak percuma senang jer
cause healthcare dekat singapore yang paling mahal lepas tu
yang lain benda percuma is of course kereta dengan rumah lah rumah jangan cakap rumah yang paling mahal
orang budak-budak singapore ni kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak kahwin tapi dia orang terpaksa kahwin sebab nakkan rumah
yang dia orang boleh mampu uh mostly is that's the case lah lepas tu yang pasal
kereta of course everybody wants to own a car even though for ten years
yang kau dah kasih orang lease for ten years engkau charge orang tu sampai hundred over thousand for a a normal car
carparks yang kita ada is tak cukup
apa barang free nak of course lah nak rumah kereta dengan healthcare healthcare is the most important
cause for healthcare dah ada pernah personal experience ah kalau dekat singapore you do not have any insurance apa-apa jadi dengan you ah
bayar lah sendiri sampai pokai
kalau ada insurance boleh cover sikit at least duit tu boleh cari juga lah
boleh apa orang cakap ah termampu
kalau no insurance at all ah kena bayar pokai-pokai ah pandai-pandai lah hidup nak
what we do okay kita tengok sejarah kita dulu-dulu
then zaman kegemilangan islam
they don't have to do anything for survival cause their life is already been taken care of the islamic the khalifah punya empire
ada dibiayai lah oleh
so apa dia orang bikin
dia belajar um err
zaman-zaman rome punya punya buku-buku
they translate daripada latin pergi arab
in fact ah even the egyptian punya historical book they can translate from egyptian to arabic
so that's why kita banyak actually a lot of our
read up about them that much but I know they are the ones who actually ah push ah macam all the
so kalau untuk zaman sekarang if you have that kind of time if we have that luxury of time
what we do right I think we also be the same thing lah we will explore untuk sekarang lagi kita ada we are very modernize
kita akan explore the space ah
ah just ah apa tu
kita manusia ni we we love to explore
we automatically learn a lot of new things lah macam gitu lah
ah repeat repeat soalan
work bukan activity work is like actually a task
task is different from activity kalau activity
okay activity yang paling boring kan eh
cause right now I'm playing my computer games I cannot imagine myself playing this computer game for eight hours straight tak boleh cause uh you need to go to the toilet to eat you need to rest
mm kalau okay lah
cause why I every time I hungry kalau rumah tak ada makan I just go to the nearest mcdonald's I just order a double cheeseburger
kira kan I don't do a lot of stuff
dekat luar I'm always at home so kalau
say about macam bad stuff no lah not really lah
kalau ada bad stuff mesti hidup pun I can't sleep at night also lah
kalau not really lah
I yang pasal ni I can't really say much lah ah ya
dia punya abs tu eight packs and after he has the eight packs everybody after him
dia jadi achilles achilles itu punya movie okay I like two movies ah in in my life right I like two movies is one is three hundred
one is ah ni lah troy so that the difference
is actually pasal orang paling kuat achilles
mm in the end he died he have a choice actually kalau dia if he if he doesn't want to die he has to stay in greece if I'm not wrong lah
had eternal glory macam orang ingat dia
any normal egoistic man he actually uh it shows kita manusia especially man ah uh all
about this movie right about three hundred and ni ah troy is all the quotes that they used
brothers what you do in life will echo in eternity itu word eh macam memang kita belajar ugama pun ustaz-ustaz pun cakap apa kau bikin kat sini nanti besok harinya pun akan kena
so it's it's about the same thing and also dalam
ah gambar-gambar macam achilles ni semua troy ni semua it's all the same thing it's their quotes eh you can actually bring it to real life and ikut lah so you won't lose out really you you won't lose out one lah
for the next two hours or six hours the book will read me so basically I'm already fast asleep but what keeps me awake is uh macam
not say I won't read I I'll read but not all those lengthy yang
texts yang panjang-panjang semua
prefer texts yang macam
yang pendek-pendek short and sweet kirakan macam gitu yes summary and also mostly
thirty two tiga puluh dua tahun
tengah buat apa is it the O levels
apa eh actually seventeen
apa eh actually nak cakap err
actually kalau if I look back in my life right
kalau whatever I've been through is actually is for my own good also
whatever lah I've been through um but kalau betul-betul nak advice of course lah um
cause at that time also kalau misal kata nak cakap oh you learn coding you learn all these app making right
resource to the in fact the poly that I learn sekolah poly that I learn is actually that was the
err orang yang ajar tu pun the knowledge of the people that teach us the lecturers are not that err they are not that brilliant also
so if you ask me to macam you know to start a something new I don't think uh there will be good advice cause
microsoft mark zuckerberg ni semua eh the way they start kan is a really is all a downhill task lah
ah so cause also apa-apapun nak kena see
tujuh belas tahun really I don't see myself having that kind of burden
to be learned wah betul-betul uh benda baru
wah ni banyak boss semua cakap gini
you just be normal stuff ah five years' time eh okay kalau cakap pasal goals eh um
I don't have the urge to buy a car cause I use to own a car and I know how expensive to own a car in singapore and really I I don't see myself like macam ada have that kind of materialistic punya goals
terus jadi billionaire
I would want to go to that path instead of any of the materialistic thing macam nak beli rumah besar
beli kereta besar all these I don't want cause benda-benda gini semua kita hidup dekat singapore we know that it won't last for cars
iphone eleven dalam one thousand plus ah
so if kalau tambah plus atau yang eh sorry iphone pro eh iphone pro dengan iphone pro max
yang tu kena check dulu like dia punya harga berapa
oh so I think tengok tempat dia plan jer lah tengok macam mana dia punya plan dia berapa gigabyte
berapa incoming call free semua like
dia punya specs ah
hmm tengok benefit benefit dia
but currently you use what phone currently pakai phone apa
ya ya our saudara
alamak drill ah buto sorry sorry pause
yang iphone eleven tu uh you plan to take which plan
tu full price ah no contract ah
oh actually iphone seven also not bad tapi I I would suggest iphone eight ah because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone ah
I think tu paling terbaik lah kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan iphone eleven is really good enough ah
ya so that one that time was during COVID kan so sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab
iya lah sebab COVID kan so not to get more consumer to buy the phone lah at a cheaper price ya
even ah android phone pun sama lah like google the new google apa pixel kan they they make it cheaper lah but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit kurang lah compared to the previous one ya
must check the new iphone right jap eh let me check eh
it has a better bionic chip the apa it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
ya they are still selling I mean um you must check you must check takpe ah ustaz tengah check
takpe ah ustaz kena check dia punya iphone punya iphone store
iphone X eh iphone X jap jap jap there's a face iphone
oh our ni eh parents eh
I think biasa ah mum is sleeping then I think bapak baru balik ya and
ah bapak kerja ah dekat ni lah iya dia kerja ni lah hari ni kerja pe hari ni hari rabu kan
tak lah I think he working three times a week
tu I think paling penting ah so like macam nanti um once I've started working
kalau tak nanti macam before this kerja macam tak prepare sangat setakat apa
macam relax relax tapi nanti end up macam tak belajar apa-apa macam cause
apa start started working kan you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing kan so you need to
for coding ah ya so basically it's not that hard lah because really we can just uh search up in the in the apa
ya ya some some some apa some company kan they
they know ah whether you you've you search online ke tak lah cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important ah it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice ah you need to really improve on it ah then you have higher chance to to be apa to be offered lah by the company
jangan kena pijak ah gitu
tapi like looking into like contract or apa
uh full time ke part time
tapi kalau full time pun there's a lot of expectation kan macam
tapi N level start sama time eh dengan O level
tapi ah the
ya tapi the condition sekarang condition sekarang macam mana dia punya COVID dia orang ambil O level december apa this COVID kat
but dia orang ambil same timing dia orang ada own shift ke apa atau it's just one time
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically ah system engineer lah you are looking to that position atau you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of dia punya ni lah
software engineer ke if
macam mana nak spell F O R T L A N
apa skills ah like
for example apa eh okay name like
I think it's like flutter dia ada own language which which covered dart eh dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is apa go golang eh golang
like owned by google ah so they they have their own language they make their own ni designed by them
yang tengah ah siapa yang tekan biasanya the manager kan the apa uh the business punya side the project manager dia orang akan tekan kan this apa
but each country like they have their own server ke atau they have their own
means like singapore have one server so lain negeri ada their own server ke
atau combine macam asia
abeh sekarang like ah
you know macam COVID pun is getting better kan singapore
malaysia pun like they they do open the border kan to singapore kan macam only for those yang business
ah green lane semua
so for the purpose of those yang ada rumah kat sana kan dia orang boleh ya for us I think we can't ah sebab we are going there basically nak apa
nak cuti kan
actually boleh balik ah because technically she is ni kan she is not singaporean kan
actually I'm not sure like our cousin yang always uh who are staying there kan who are staying there syakilah iman do they dia orang boleh datang sini ke
unless dia orang ada they ada kerja dekat sini lah dia orang ada kerja kan atau rumah kat sini kan
the malaysia people ah the ah all our saudara kat sana
oh cik rozi lama tak call eh
alhamdulilah dah makan dah I think
mum cook apa kari ayam so we just ate tu lah we just ate the
kuah apa kari ah kuah kari and I just cook telur sikit then makan
tapi tu lah
ah that one the smell nanti apa
iya lah bau dia kan nanti tu kan nanti iya lah tutup tingkap
but I know ah I know how to cook macam like simple simple ah like usually I cook thai food ah sweet and sour fish
and kai lan ikan masin
baby kai lan ikan masin so macam setakat ikut ni ah ikut youtube and
ya kadang-kadang beli kat ni fairprice
giant so just beli apa
barang-barang semua dekat ni ah barang-barang kat giant and fairprice
kalau ada takde ah just find a replacement ah macam
that time takde ikan apa eh ikan tenggiri ke apa eh
so uh I replaced it with ikan apa nama dia
tak tahu ah nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin ah macam ketul-ketul macam cube ikan cube
simple lah dia punya masak it's not that hard ah just ikut dia punya youtube punya tutorial
ah boneless and dia macam I think it's dried ah dried food dried fish
ya macam you you macam very dried lah dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat
ya so macam like it's in terms in the form of cube ah cube then with that cube just ah letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu
once the the fish dah tu kan
dah lembut ah baru tu lah pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak baby kai lan
letak kicap oyster sauce so once dah
dah panaskan I think like
five to ten minutes dah siap
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome ah kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa make sure letak dengan tepung ah tapi dia punya sauce senang nak buat ah sweet and sour sauce
tapi tu lah I think this is like the starting point ah cuma macam nak I think I took me awhile ah like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring macam you need to macam
potong ni lah
ya true ah barang-barang dah siap if someone already did that for me kan senang ah I think my life will be easier
cuma itulah you need
tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada agreement dia is just one house kan the maid
the agreement biasanya one maid macam
jaga one house kan
iya lah iya lah of course
ah iya lah
pause jap eh pause jap
but if the maid macam they have their own tu kan kerja timing dia kan
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day kan except malam ah kan
dah berumur ya
mmhmm betul
ada lah dekat fairprice fairprice fairprice punya online
ada lah sometimes I think
that time I saw like macam halal punya daging kan
ya really ni lah dia punya which section eh the section yang ada frozen food
actually I saw this youtube video ah very interesting dia macam punya shopping
tapi I don't think singapore ada ah dia macam like I think in america ke apa ah which country atau china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop kan there'll be someone who welcome you pastu ah you using the lah I think it's a like the device ah you need to buy the device device
if if memang ya stock finish of course the thing is empty lah dia punya ni ah
tapi it's very hard ah like I mean the software wise like
iya lah iya lah
of course ah dia punya price mahalnya it's like you're playing four punya punya tu kan console
but I think can be solved ah like technology wise macam they keep changing kan most like it's probably ah I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change ah macam in terms of like the new normal
like dulu takde kan I think previously my company my former company dia pernah offer ah work from anywhere so one year macam they give like seven days ah
kat rumah lah you can can stay at home or go overseas apa
ah ya lah as long as you do something lah usually the manager will ni lah the
you need to be apa
ah ya lah my company former company use zoom for ni lah
macam container ah nak letak something container like small one ah ya but I think ah
tak tahu ah hari tu my friend tanya nak pergi ikea ke tak dia ajak
ya they they limit ni lah the number of ah customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure berapa ah
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those yang one person kan they will sit at the seat of four kan nanti macam they don't apa utilise the space ah they don't make use of the space
then end up macam the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time lah kalau weekend kan in tampines kan
ya the queue selalu panjang
nak control eh ya ya
ya betul
oh iya lah iya lah
ya I think it's a bit tu lah a bit
it's a bit scary ah kalau if
ada orang break the rule apa kan
like actually you say you heard places yang some
apa dia orang kena ni kan kena warning kan because of this thing kan
like the customer tak ikut ni
ya lah you see like in at apa shopping mall like it's those crowded kan nowadays macam susah nak control ah
ya I think they will just monitor lah this apa maybe there's someone
watching the ke apa kan they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor yang
macam detect
check out lah don't check out lah ya it's very difficult to ni
about I think regarding the the battery lah dia cepat habis ah
like the the nearby devices kan siapa yang
um google and apple kan to ni with the android dengan phone
or you still stick with ni
I think this is still depends cause google home kan they detect ni kan the surrounding kan
as long as jauh ah microphone dengan I mean dia punya google home kan ada microphone kan
I'm not too sure ah like like what will be the reply like ah macam default like
ya maybe ah maybe ya ya the default punya default
oh iya lah iya lah ada offline data lah persistent storage ah
maybe you can try like alexa ke
tapi but then it just think of us like their lagipun singapore is moving into smart nation kan so at certain points at certain ah zone for example I think punggol ke sengkang eh
like punggol kan there's there's a lot of flat kan so I think these flats dia orang ada their own smart punya apa devices ah macam ah smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart lah basically so bila macam masuk bilik
for example smart light you enter a room kan nanti dia macam the intensity akan increase ah
as we walk into macam tu example jer lah
so tak payah tekan butang ke apa
I think they have ah macam
ya macam ada sensor kan
ah iya lah iya lah
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country kan dia kat india eh
ya there's some country use that ah macam pedal ke apa
I think in singapore ada some building kan dia macam like if inside the lift takde button
only kat luar jer
those abilities like macam
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours macam you cakap you want to be superman atau pun nak jadi
oh bat sorry batman or iron man okay kau nak jadi batman or iron man I would also want a superpower yang
mm dia bukan dia bukan specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
ah so for me oh ya teleporting eh didn't actually come across my mind until tadi sebut teleporting
any place of the world you tau macam harry potter
err magic spell I forgot lah apa magic spell ah
mm ah disapparate ah dia orang disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age ah
goblet of fire cedric diggory yang ada siapa tu yang handsome tu nama dia ah
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like macam switch on and off
budak-budak kan
for me to macam tahu what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I do not want macam to be burdened
ah boleh on and off ah gitu
the thing is on and off lah I think every superpower ada burdensome
telepathy ah eh sorry apa
it depends lah whether you have more time the thing is people I think people nak this
duit definitely okay
okay apa
superpower macam okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe ah
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or jaga or apa
budak nangis datang kasi peluk to orang besar kan macam nothing ah tapi
in the mata like macam orh
but what if naik lemak
like they dia orang tak nak
they just expect to be given eh dia ni rich apa so tak payah lah work hard so we just wait for him apa to durian runtuh
unlimited duit
it's something that you think of lah but I to me I think you know me as a person kan I'm not a person that wants unlimited duit
with unlimited duit
because ah okay the thing is something there macam
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that apa I respect it's just that I'm just
since you were saying superpower apa ni your superpower of unlimited duit
if there's if that's if there is someone kan macam
ubat for COVID nineteen like the perfect ubat
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study belajar macam mana like
like macam
free only untuk
K the thing is I think kan kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni kan
probably free depending on what type of ubat
err like singapore singapore doesn't give macam a lot of things percuma free
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone betul tak
apa you your superpower that you wanted was
unlimited duit
knowledge you pun macam meh uh macam gitu lah
dengan my personality lah
or do you want to give me a superhero that macam sama dengan I wonder woman
wonder woman is just macam too feminist ah
about wonder woman agaknya macam most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie kekasih dia
ya lambat gila lah sampai kekasih dia
she had to watch her kekasih die
I think they will filming ah lepas tu dia orang stop pasal COVID nineteen kan
oh dah habis filem dengan production eh
oh because of COVID nineteen then tak boleh ramai-ramai tengok oh
eh why not kan dia orang macam
macam okay Netflix is a one time payment uh tapi kalau nak tengok movie movie ni
movie baru
atau pun movie lama-lama
Netflix bayar per month lah because we are using we are sharing accounts right so
untuk for us saje lah but I'm not too sure how much but
this production macam
so macam mana dia orang buat duit
ah those movie yang exclusive
dalam Netflix ya
ya lah monthly subscription which is berapa jer
okay pasal bapa sponsor ni I know too well pasal I watch korean dramas kadang-kadang dia punya sponsor macam over sangat

cepat tidur lebih tidur mm macam gitu lah uh
bila tengok movie ke tengok drama macam gitu ah
lupa pula apa initial question tadi eh
apa tu spiderman you're saying ah
ah betul betul betul
batman macam ego ah gitu
ah tu lah pasal that time you ada bilang I yang batman ada different different type of batman kan satu batman cakap okay untuk bunuh orang satu batman cakap tak okay untuk bunuh orang ah tu banyak personality lah
kalau burdensome is like
macam cakap ego I told that the batman ego pasal
dia fikir dia boleh bunuh orang ah pasal dia
sebab tu dia tahu oh dia ni boleh mati dia ni tak boleh mati dia ni tak boleh mati
mm dia punya burdensome
kalau dia tahu dia let this one go away mana tahu this one will
ya lah tangkap
tak bunuh kan

cerita kami ni eh
okay ada lagi lima saat empat saat
okay then nak bual pasal apa

for the rest oh my god it's so lame you nak makan apa
and dia kata apa he wanted to eat ya I told him if we get like one thing
then he was like ya nasi ayam
entah lah
speaking of makanan
so it's like a shape of a sotong
you tengok you tengok you just look at it first you want turn turn on the lights or no
kejap eh
eh it's delicious sedap
but is the shape of sotong
sedap kan so that is mala this is the most spiciest one
so the tak pedas sangat like
ada rasa macam dia then then dia tak macam meresap or like or like lama-lama macam tu
sedap kan sedap kan
so um I google and then youtube this thing cuba tengok dia orang makan macam mana um basically they open like four five packets
dekat dalam mangkuk and then apa
sedap kan
they will accept this conversation at us kunyah-kunyah makan-makan
but you see the shape of the sotong is actually it looks legit macam sotong
oh my bad jangan kena baju
it will really stain tadi tadi you drop on my kasut

ah sudah belajar
and then I took a apa
it's like two totally different things and then I got a before that I got uh no when I was at when I had my diploma I had my apa

macam eh he's not like this but
you know a for a fact that yang dia tak macam ini tetapi
dia punya perangai macam eh he he's like putting a front or a defense kind of thing
everyone macam sus

so it's like wah ini kalau ada uh ya can always teman what like someone to talk to
instead of seorang seorang
ya exactly then it's going to be perap in this whole room
considerable amount of space to joget-joget
move around lah at least I got I can have stuff to throw around like bersepahkan
I can upgrade myself but then the thing is everything semua sekarang tengah mahal I don't know ah like
I have no idea okay lah probably yes I have an idea what is is mahal now because
panasnya ya allah
then that that that's the thing price should be kurang apa should be lesser what
and nak itu pasang apa
and then have to pasang another door it's going to be costly it is going to cost like more then two three hundred dollars already
the outside of the house was like rimas
then after that bersepah lagi then rimas makin lama makin lama makin rimas
ya I miss that place because of the hall and then it was overlooking the pool the huge windows I have this thing with windows ah tingkap macam best
kan mahal
you fikir masak-masak dulu like from now until february because he was thinking of moving in february
then I was like fikir masak-masak dulu like if you move in
kenapa mama nak pergi kranji suddenly
okay then cause suddenly she message me out of the blue kata nak pergi kranji tak three day two night then I was like wait what was I doing just that time ah I was like I think I was settling my mum's you know then like super busy lah then suddenly dapat message tu abeh I macam eh apasal suddenly but she didn't tell taufik at all
ah so yesterday I told taufik like eh my mum got message you or not that she wants to do all these thing then taufik was like just shaking his head so she haven't discuss like what why she want to go bila nak pergi mama tak ada bilang ah
itu dekat dengan jalan rasuk eh
so entah lah so let's just wait until mama like reply whether is it like a go ahead or not I mean if she wants to go to sentosa capella I don't mind lah cause you can use the hundred dollars voucher for that what then this one suddenly I'm like cam mana nak kata no
ya lor the the the new park royal is also err halal ya ya ya my sis is going I think in december my both my sis my sis-in-law they are bringing all the budak-budak kecil ah ada some glamping for kids inside the hotel rooms ya
ya then you can use the hundred dollars the rediscover voucher also but this morning I was like looking at the list lah didn't see the kranji one but I saw ada ada apa eh oh I saw got capella then capella you have the spa inside the room
then besides that ada apa lagi eh um W hotel the sentosa one also I mean it's a little bit upscale but then you can use that hundred dollars voucher then all of us can use together right so okay daripada kranji
eh it baru keluar ah
tu lah
eh kalau snow city I can ask any of my ex-colleagues what then can go in for free
ya nanti lah next time we go over to your house I will ask mama what she wants to do but not this two weeks this two weeks like crazy gila
not son of a peach punya
err block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so masa I kecil-kecil there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
then there will also be macam ada bau tak sedap ah but okay my family tak kena sangat ah but our neighbour pernah
nak dengar ghost story
so my neighbour I think tingkat dua we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think pukul sepuluh ke apa there was somebody who came over to their house macam you know the makcik-makcik jual keropok err they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open ah so it it was a makcik selling cake tunjuk the cake all that so macam my neighbour kasihan then my neighbour pun beli lah the cake
so the makcik dah go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a batu nisan inside
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like tersipu-sipu
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents punya renovation so they just got the key on deepavali like after like one month of extension then that one also like a little bit of a merepek ah cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it sebab dorang dah change dorang punya address
abeh entah lah like very niao ah so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november deepavali is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend yang they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so err eventually on fourteen november they got the key then um we went to the house the next day taufik pun pergi the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime cuci jer keluar like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to beli the odour eliminator ah spray around a few times I think err we went on sunday last spray for the things then err I went again on monday
the next day ah the next day bau masih tak hilang ah cause twenty cats seh so spray spray spray lagi still tak hilang abeh bila I balik I was like having like a huge headache then err eventually I call err macam professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser juga so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces ah so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the masuk the nak buat dia eh
tanya eh ni ada berapa kucing ni seh lepas tu I cakap dengan dia lah ada ada twenty cats dia macam wah teruk seh but he was like telling us that err okay ah the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so dia pergi dekat switch then he call us lah say eh I think this house ada pijat punya infestation juga
because apparently on top of the switch ada colour black black black which is actually an indication of tahi pijat ah so he was like hopefully all the pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali ah the all the bed bugs semua but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be pijat or not so yes but yesterday my mum pergi dah tak ada the smell sangat so I guess it worked but
ya err the pijat is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change ah so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went tak ada the smell sangat and then macam um I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but ada lah macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat the living room so macam we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay lah but end up the cause they went again macam
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension kan so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow lah dorang tak kasi then dah jadi my parents house apa so my parents pergi tu yang they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there oi kalau I think if my parents tahu pun they wouldn't have the house lah but no momok so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa lah jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke
you cari you cari dekat which what site
have you tried yang those the punya job fairs pun tak ada
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense pun dorang will go to like some companies
aduh entah lah
or not really I mean tak ada bonus ah and all that apa ya as long as still something ah like my dad got a job my dad kan masa tu kena retire he got a job pun tu tak dapat bonus ke apa so that one is that only contract for one year ya
oh that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family kat airport for like one minute to lambai-lambai only
ya but um he also kena so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants semua kena stay at crowne plaza so ya lah they only like macam see each other bila my brother keluar dari the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his uh daughter cuma lambai
but tak boleh jumpa what is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother dah lama tak makan makanan melayu right so
he requested for nasi lemak on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for apa benda tu nasi ambeng or is it laksa one of it lah then malam he asked for bandung
missing all the local food simon to either macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
err they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still macam makanan the variety is not as much lah ya
what oh mama high class you tak tahu ke
ya but mama high class lah that time ah she was watching her japan show eh at at your house lah then she texted me err nura masa tu kita ada stay dekat hotel tokyo one one of the atas hotel lah then I say no we didn't stay at the atas hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like wah situ ada makanan halal
abeh I said but we also eat makanan halal apa
actually if apa right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb ah then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very macam open to try food ya it's like macam she said like macam okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really lah we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point kan you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
ah itu ramen tu
oh kita orang tak bawa pergi ah sashimi sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya ramen miso but not sushi she say she oh tak makan seaweed kan so tak bawa ah but all the rest dorang makan banyak obese apa
no idea ya like even the um balik punya flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
I agree eh tapi kan nasi lemak I still prefer the silk air punya have you tried ah
oh my god the silk air punya is so nice ya oh I think out of all the err nasi lemak okay ah not counting like parents masak semua kan silk air nasi lemak is like up there ya but you cannot choose what so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with nasi lemak or not
like people say malaysia punya nasi lemak sedap kan I think silk air one that one is sedap
so I was telling taufik like maldives kan ada banyak island kan like can you open up one island just for singaporeans untuk okay what
I think ni kena write in to maldives nya government kan
tak boleh eh
ya lah for as long as he stay there I'm going to like betul-betul tekan
flying some of his friends have been retrenched like err he's flying A three fifty so a three fifty ada banyak flights so during the COVID period he has been to canada he was in new york he was in seattle he was in singapore he was in melbourne err where again
abeh the later later one banyak like holiday people ya but qatar dia punya border control is still strict not like macam
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to lepaskan the requirement of the singapore government ah lepas tu baru they fly to singapore expert
okay lah not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore ah like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian punya banyak like jiwang-jiwang
or rindu family cakap dua minggu jer sekarang dah lapan bulan that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore banyak oh where is the class for this err ataupun rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through
our own life walaupun macam tak banyak benda going on but it's still like a lot of things happening
eh but my parents punya company so far quite good
tapi kan they tak hack the flooring for the they tak hack flooring semua ah they hack the skirting pastu they ah oh the service yard kan kita punya ada the that door the windows ah that one can hack they hack it out
oh ya macam face the apa the main road ke
but actually five year at ubi ones are not bad macam like my house kalau dah five year and a lot of people kan jual the the house if they take care of their houses actually it's not bad it's if you get the previous owner yang teruk tu yang ya ya you have a lot of things to do but I'm sure like if if we sell your house you will buy right
the five year one ah is one that you can consider cuma maybe you have to do the toilet ah
no it's homogeneous tiles but somehow when we went that time they were the only company to have this kind of tiles yang macam like a little bit kasar-kasar
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi I don't know where they go
entah lah like competition
ya ours macam the my sister punya is like newer tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah ours kalau you tengok the door kan yang dia punya handle is quite solid but my sister punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka
kan abeh dia punya tempat masak the hood dah jatuh-jatuh
ya so if you want to buy buy techno jangan beli bosch
ah ya ya kena macam ada talk forum
then after a few years you kena tukar kan ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it masa kita orang pergi that's why it's like um it's
um it's a little bit more atas than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the dia punya tu macam fulfilling macam very atas kitchen
okay lah I why they didn't choose quartz that time oh cause kita orang pemalas they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz jadi sebab kita nanti take the pot terus letak on the kitchen counter
taufik and I are the pemalas kind
granite the good thing is ya lah if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous pastu um tak banyak choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you kena buat sealing dia lah but kita orang tak pernah buat abeh nampak macam still okay apa takyah lah malas ya
oh okay dekat sini ada mister but I don't know whether they will have the washi tape ke tidak
okay lah okay lah I think some of the stuff not expensive ah but gold colour you better better have to go to JCube dah lama seh tak pergi jcube if I go there I will only go to JEM tomorrow jcube a bit out of the way ah
dorang nak tutup the temporary interchange to pindah to another temporary interchange kan did you read
it will be a temporary interchange again dah ten years eh
I work oh wait before I start working or is still the old one pastu I work the pindah to the temporary interchange and then I dah quit work dah three years with nparks baru pindah to another temporary and then last I read another ten years baru siap
so I cakap hillion dah siap dan yishun punya dah siap and then ah yes correct I think woodlands punya pun will be done before the jurong one will be done who the ah
ada masa the fifty was it ah fifty they say that by the year twenty twenty err apa they will move the science centre then science centre masih kat tempat lama aduh
entah lah ya I mean I would prefer at jurong lah cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be macam dekat dengan water feature entah lah but oh they said after that err they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground err ya
abeh before COVID kenapa tak nak start
apa jer aduh well that's jurong for you tapi jurong punya rumah mahal
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news kata that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is ada ke tidak
kalau you beli rumah nak beli kat mana
no it's just too expensive actually kan taufik and I were like looking to upgrade ke tidak tau cause like we were thinking lah that there was a period of time where mama say that she wants to come here stay over lah but we don't have any extra room what so we were thinking right should we upgrade to four room I mean I don't know whether you notice but we change our fan
we we were thinking of that but the thing is tapi sebab entah err like that lah slowly lah ya then apanya
we like the house punya location you know bawah there's a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery tak you don't see like into neighbour punya rumah so nak cari like really our criteria susah
like our neighbours are also okay pastu we have like area kat rumah to plant our garden
the area is in front of our house not in front of their house so takpe lah dorang pun dapat menikmati all the pemandangan-pemandangan plants yang taufik bawa balik
tak lah dia pun tengok agaknya dia tengok our area quite nice jadi dia takyah tambah dia tengok alah tak ada pokok besar lah jadi dia letak satu pokok besar dekat situ
ya holidays during off peak period it's cheaper the places that I went I want to go to pun tak crowded then ya then cheap and the tak crowded is the most important criteria
oh ya sekarang parents semua ada whatsapp chat right
pecah-pecah but we don't mind lah cause we know that you can always put back what but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam like perempuan apa melayu terakhir eh
so that's why bawa dia lah pergi wash hands semua pastu keluar dia nampak lego jer terus macam hundred and eighty degrees turn ah like oo what's this pastu ambil then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see taufik punya dorang tak faham
because star wars kan so all the err apa all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take seh and then one of the transformer cup ah you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said oh what's inside then she actually open up
and macam take out all the mini fixed ah aduh and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old pastu dah dah dah do a lot of things lah then start riding a bicycle oh dah can understand a lot ah oh she can baca ayat kursi also
ya kalau dekat schools nak deal with the parents pastu to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other wah macam mana seh mm ya lah that one is also like my last priority
what's that ya for the seven years I dah tak boleh tahan ah at least this one it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain pun tak mendak sangat
yes correct dah hafal sangat
I tak pernah buat tuition like
oh dear actually why they why madrasah tak ambil like the err trained teachers ah
entah lah I'm not too sure
and my sis nak hantar my niece masuk madrasah tau
ah I tak tahu so next year my niece three years old then dia nak hantar pergi those macam ah hafal quran punya classes all that
mm so don't know lah cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so dia kata takpe lah dia nak hantar the my niece pergi masuk madrasah so let's see how it goes anyway baru two years old seh
ya asalkan you ada education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really macam plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think taufik will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid apa bau all the plants also ya I can imagine that
kenapa tak botanist seh
eh dulu I kecil-kecil kan I don't know whether I got tell you before I wanted to be a farmer
oh I I really wanted to jaga my own kambing-kambing like like want to be self-sustainable gitu like have my kambing-kambing oh sheep sheep so I can like err jual dia punya wool then um like kat new zealand then kat switzerland ke then like macam ada a small muslim community there so I boleh buatkan korban lah dekat their
no I think I think she like macam because her life
got so susah kan so she want like
she tak nak tengok dia punya husband and new wife hidup senang
ya so I think that's what she wanted lah so that the husband hidup susah juga macam tak fair kalau
I think she fell in love with the company as in because the guy is always there for her tapi cause that's what she's not getting from the husband what
who the siapa
dia berapa episode ah sixteen eh
but other than that I think macam the korean punya broadcasting stations all like their um
ah no sebab kan
so I hardly ever like really habis kan any drama
I actually for my migraine lah cause my ubat migraine finish already
skin condition if it's like macam he can lah
then he said is a malay doctor quite young then dia cakap can ah but
he will prescribe topical or oral punya ubat like they don't do aesthetic services ah
then I say okay I understand then lepas tu dia cakap but if you want I can try to give you like
macam the first three months I give you this ubat
because he said is not ah because I I I did ask him is my macam I feel like my face is so macam rabak ah then dia cakap
oh err it's not like macam really a severe case so I can still macam prescribe prescribe
ubat for you
but I have cheeks I have like comedonal acne on my cheeks all the all the all the kecil-kecil punya biji
ya lah like macam there's no head on top right
like I don't macam I don't see myself spending
but yours is not like macam yours is just macam white heads kind of
ah you just get from Cosrx kat Watsons ada
maybe that's because like macam depends on the product lah
haven't yet macam usually my cystic acne right other than this lah
usually they will just be there no head and then after some time they just gone gitu jer
like macam after you get you've after you give birth like macam
and then apa bekam kan muka ada mini cups LOL what the heck
even even in even on weekends right macam rare gila
I think aini macam semua turun-menurun because ayah dulu pun ada pe macam gini
you see ayah face lah or all the macam wak mak long also have like
like the bekas-bekas
I regret one thing I regret right macam in my life
my poly first year seventeen when I gatal-gatal you know bila
ya lah then because you remember you gave me the Kat Von D foundation dulu
you use the macam the high the heavy duty punya Kat Von D dulu then
no lah I'm just saying then I didn't know what macam I didn't know last time there's lightweight foundation and heavyweight foundation what so I just use that every time so macam I think that
but it's so it's not accessible nak beli
ya so kirakan macam
kalau pakai makeup lebih
muka muka lagi rabak even though like macam I do the proper cleansing ah
ya because like macam I don't put anything on my face what and I do macam regular
punya skincare
pakai plaster
I know I mean it's the wrong timing for my pimple sticker to habis but don't know ah see how lah later
ya kebaya
boots no I never buy I never buy I only buy like strappies and the tu
apa senang lah kalau nak pergi kerja
two bikes what then I thought like macam he thought when I get my license then I just
use that lah rather than to leave that bike all the time kat car park jer tak buat apa-apa
the high maintenance mean kalau buat delivery is very macam will cepat rosak and cepat
masalah so naz will spend more if he use that bike to do delivery

ibu patutlah patutlah you very skinny
but is he matrep no right
like old matrep eh
then now my eyes pedih because of that nevermind I'm used to it
macam when I was at gold coast right
then I just macam even though I was alone
but macam to go to the shopping or outlets all right macam kena naik tram then I will go alone
no I I didn't like macam I didn't do that but
I think some of my ex colleagues did that but dekat
colour lain colour
some of them or even yang lagi gila right I've seen right those yang pergi athens flight
habis lepas tu tak salah is three or four nights there layover then they will go to santorini
tak penat ke kan
tak ah I think it's not ah
eh terkeluar eh babi
no lah later if my eye berair all
ya can make your bulu ketiak straight also
sterilise ah kononnya
you know malaysians have this malaysians have like some cream treatment like macam they inject shit into their face
so macam a bit hypocrite
I baru makan tiga hari
masih ada it's still selling at baraqah
but I don't feel like macam I just wanted to try this first
ya Odella made me lose weight because I shit a lot I shit sampai air watery
my err itu ah immune
oh you didn't drop out ayah quit
ayah called ayah told me after tu
abang kita kena buat recording untuk survey ni kan
oh okay okay can can boleh boleh
um kena berbual pasal apa though like what we
ya I mean movie also boleh and
say that time err me and abang afal pergi tengok movie dekat cinema movie apa
ah your eyes tell dia punya movie is pasal is a ah japanese movie lah so kita dia punya cerita sedih gila
I don't know I was just like tengah nangis-nangis rabak lah but then the cerita is about like satu perempuan ni dah macam dia buta temporarily
ya like tak buta mata lah because like he she was like she got into an accident
and like lepas tu like
macam dekat part of the story was like the guy that dia suka or like macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta kan
it's actually it was was one of the reason why dia buta
ya ah because of like when he got when she got into an accident the lelaki tu macam buat benda yang like
tak tak supposed to buat lah because you know you know
ah then after that like it lead her to macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu
then yang paling sedih part is actually like bila
err perempuan tu kena undergo surgery kan pasal boleh actually boleh like rawat lah like boleh get better so that guy pasal that guy macam very poor tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam you know
kerja cara wrestling semua so kerja untuk like because they macam ah couple what
so like that guy macam ah dia
kerja sampai dapat duit untuk undergo for that girl to undergo surgery ah
then after and then after that bila like uh
ya so because of that rant dia bagi like duit to undergo surgery then when the surgery tu was successful
dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu lah because he doesn't want to like
and after that yang part sedih was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
dia macam contact later like contemplating whether he should jumpa perempuan tu balik or like
tinggalkan so bila part like
bila part dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena stabbed
from like this like bad people because dia dulu kerja memang jahat
then after that dia kena coma for two years ah
lelaki tu kena coma for two years and after that he was in like this like care hospital macam orang jaga then that girl was one of the volunteer
you know the thing is like bila coma so he cannot talk what
ah that's japanese punya movie lah but then bila like sekarang hospital tu then the guy was like the the guy saw the girl but he cannot say anything then he was crying so bad then perempuan tu macam
apa ni like
then like he alleged actually before that he also macam buat sculpture
ceramic so he before that macam when dia buta he she felt the lelaki muka ah
so and then after that uh I think macam there was one this music box yang reminded of both of them
one of the pekerja kata dengan perempuan tu yang there's this guy who came in the
crying while listening to music box terus dia tahu ah that was like the last part terus dia tahu yang
apa it was the guy that
ya but then the only reason why she wanted to undergo the surgery was because the guy kata um you don't want to see like our home together our future together our child together then the part damn sad ah sedih gila and after that ya me and abang was like tengah teared out already then the whole cinema tengah nangis gila kelakar gila seh
no I mean like if I explain all obviously like it doesn't really make sense lah but then if you tengok the trailer is already so sad ya that's like the the movie yang like made me cry so bad
in a cinema like never in my life I cry so bad but I cried so bad there then even my abang was like are you crazy
kat netflix kan
how many seasons ada though
eh banyak
wah it's like macam the
dia pada like when he was like a'ah
dia semua ingat dia orang macam like weird
who are this semua nak
kahwin semua and like a lot of people look down on him lah
oh ah betul betul
serious ah ah so like betul betul just like awkward lah
ah tak boleh just
just like kahwin terus lah dia dia straight
but like to me like nowadays I don't I'm not that interested in those like mat salleh
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and kakak and abang also like watch everyday like at the

I I beli like I bought there was like
a few only then I'm like I mean okay lah it's not that expensive so ni lah I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits dekat
dekat somerset
it's like bingsoo then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe dekat dengan

a'ah then kau kalau also need to promote then what if like orang don't want to come so
tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap then that was the problem fit in the cafe

so six thirty dah habis then I balik dengan dia so macam surprise juga apa kan ya so so then macam either that or I still meet them at causeway point ya habis lepas tu end up like we didn't agree on anything ya and then on wednesday she text me yang she ordering food on friday so means dah confirm lah kan ya
I mean not really discuss lah but then like we talked about it but we don't we didn't came to an agreement that okay we shall do this you know that kind macam we just talk then lepas tu but also because it's her house and then we we we know like I think she know I know that like you cannot just come the house that kind because there got one time

not bukan macam like yang splash it was
err tulang dropped then there was a splash and I thought it was gone but okay lah but everybody is stained lah just now everybody have err something to remember ya ya

anyways uh ya you were saying apa tadi afikah pasal
something about because the way the way they how her work is like she got dia ada macam beberapa sample gitu
because in her team kan ada macam leader tau
so leader leader nak kena macam like
err macam leader macam uh if got macam the night shift people right never finish right the sample so leader need to come in earlier lah
so if this is a macam leader punya role lah
so tapi macam this leader there's no everybody got same pay but like you in charge ah you team leader
so they cakap lah got one one time tu
eh dia cakap dia she was in the toilet sekali ada this leader
ah and another girl inside the cubicle don't know then was talking ah talking talking like the leader say ya I want to leave ah like macam like you know
so diorang cakap then the other lady was saying like err eh then you leave then how ah
cause is like err say I also new say dia cakap like you know why they want to like you know ask me be leader because her partner that is uh this indian lady lah older than her like master degree and all
but tapi dia macam I think the quiet type lah you know and like she like so many years been housewife never work
oh okay but but I think also based on what she like say her other colleague pun macam like eh
like maybe those like not not not so vocal very dominant one like you know talk softly maybe you know so tak maybe ya I don't know maybe tak
tak stand out properly I think ya
ya but it's it's ya but I think I think I tell her okay apa like you know at least you know the next job
ya ya actually but I tell her it's good what kita nak orang orang ya that's why
so what was the painting yang painting tu dekat mana
ya so so what's what's what's going on dekat apa gillman baracks is that ah is there anything going on there and when the last time we went there for exhibition right
eh apa tadi
tiba-tiba ah
the first his car tu apa
more than she did that then what's that just now she called me then dia cakap dia nak apa go vivian house tomorrow
ada jer
mangsa dia kan
dah habis eh
okay so nanti next next friday dah decided where to eat
tapi I think dia macam macam weird leh
cause senang lah you are you're opening a restaurant and you are using my name eh
you know eh kau aku one thing then you use my name
oh she came ah tadi
okay habis so sekarang dia tak laptop ke macam mana
eh ya you say you want to have like nak advertise what paid by
so hari ni siapa buat all these err like math questions
there's time for solat there's time to bath there's time to eat
yang first paragraph tu nak kena bagus lah
that's why I was eh ya ada eh accountant
but last time was like very far because apa eh dia macam english camp gitu ah
go this camp ah and like dia ajar dia ada macam
err I think ada video let him talk then he see himself
I think last time eh ada tau macam Mendaki Mendaki macam apa
macam like err after kind and then like
that kind got cedar girls tapi ada ah macam all that ada
macam really smart smart student one ah ah ya lah for sure
tapi ada juga ya some some of them is nice ah nice like talk normally some of them also like a bit weird you know
like macam
then ah think we were int the room then I don't know what's wrong with that guy makan pun nak tidur
then the aircon have to be like super blast one ah then quite sejuk
some Mendaki camp right so we had like solat all that lah
you know they need to pay tahu tak I think tak payah
I don't think I think I go there by self I go there myself I come back pun myself
that one ya uh tapi he buy like those like
nak buat apa sia ni buat apa
tak ingat ah siapa
so tu dia orang lah
ni apa ni ni kira apa ni Facebook ah
ya lah dengar baik dengar they they say that now
err apa eh get the sebab like
like your parents punya house probably yes maybe back then it was like that right now you know maybe things have changed
so tanya ah your mum macam mana
eh tapi you not there what you should be there I think you should be around ah like to hear like you know that time you were around right mencari sales whatever whatever right
ya ya what I'm saying I'm I'm not you know I think the first step what I'm interested in is to know whether the view has changed or not from the last meeting until now whether they are dah tukar ke belum
kalau dia dah tukar what is changed you know
ya ya then from there then she cuma
mm so I think what you are concerned that one dah macam like stage three stage four lah to sell like how to like
now is number one kita nak tahu whether boleh
ya boleh boleh jual ke tak boleh jual kita belief that can jual also is is it really makes sense to jual
then if jual already then after that then
and like decide on what to do kalau it's not doesn't really make sense to sell then why you want to sell right
semalam ada dengar yang pasal news yang I think there is another three families yang dia cakap

even tasha pun
tak tahu if she kept hers tasha last buat cermin mata was the one nazan made for her
oo ni tasha ya she got a supposedly free specs that eh that one I think ida did hers
cause it was such a long time just to choose which err apa
everything dah siap
later dekat waterway point I need to collect my stuff from her
then I have my all the two tudung
it thinks it easy but it's not I'm so busy with so many things so many things coming up my kacang having promo
macam dah tau kejap eh
yes we're planning to meet up for another another time once the teachers dah school holiday because semalam um haidar and ida still cannot make it their dia orang ada class eh bukan kelas dia orang ada um jumpa parent jumpa mak bapa
ourselves you guys only need to go out at night for teh mummies need to go out for lunch
buat lah you punya ni
plan dengan dia orang
tak tengah check something
I think banyak government bodies are using raffle's medical for checkup
K never mind like I dekat I I can't recall
it's so leceh
malas lah nak buat zoom zoom ni I'm not comfortable lah nanti
nanti I keep looking at the teacher while I dah tak tahu nak tanya apa lagi dekat teacher nadia
just like sad that her malay teacher tu
cikgu melayu dia cikgu hafizah dah tak ada ah
err cikgu suhanis is there lah definitely she's
but I believe cikgu iza will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say cikgu suhanis is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then cikgu iza make it more interesting
when nadia is in P three err cikgu hafiza she's lucky because she knows cikgu hafiza even before she started
ah teaching her so cikgu hafiza already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
when when the teacher she tak suka
see like the I mean not apa
um dia punya prefect punya tu
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance eh her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her kakak
at least she got two to her ni to her name
ya dia suka panjat-panjat pe banyak pe they go hiking and everything but then sekarang
she's the one yang climbing all over the place
tak boleh loose out ke dia
dia takleh kalah you understand or not
that's why dia main game dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang jer tapi I think dah I rasa dah better lah sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh lah dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam iman main nak menang
then you nak nanti settle the boys
I don't know if see kalau tak sempat masak
macam penat lah nak masak ini hari I tak tahu nak masak apa
nanti you just get
but I think it sounds better to last night I think I didn't hear sangat
semalam I think dah kurang ah
nasib nasib baik dia orang suka minum they they dia orang minum air putih
I think she's coming from sengkang I don't know whether she's bringing her son along later si mas ni
they've prepared so much so half a year later baru dah towards the end nak nak nak dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat
kalau tak nanti kelam kabut because kalau you start only in in in P six there's too many things to catch up
because the thing is for me dia punya the the the problem sum lah
baik lah as long as it's not so expensive lah but I think this teachers are
okay boleh
okay lah boleh
ah next time me parents gateway you kena cepat-cepat kasi I tau
parents gateway punya details nanti kalau you dah start kerja I tak tahu apa-apa seh
the cikgu I mean the the and tasha tasha's teachers are using class dojo
like your what like what your sister was mentioning lah during this COVID it's best that they don't change classes because it's easier for contact tracing it's easier lah they don't want to ignore it because if not you have to go back and change back then the thing is our the girl also pun what like like tasha they she still moved around to
err this kind of thing you have to macam mak bapa ah then sometimes they will advise biasa ah macam orang tua they have their preferred um preferred kadi of choice macam they dorang have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer tak ah kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi ah lembut cara dia berbual that kind of thing lah so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding err you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you err boleh book ah then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of kadi available then all the kadi then they also show like where the kadi lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them lah basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer macam oh takut kadi err they wanted for morning morning wedding kan so dorangnya ceremony for the nikah pagi so dorang tak nak macam kadi takut jam so kalau katakan they wanted to have a eight
um ceremony kan then after that oh nine ceremony then katakan they scared oh if the kadi tinggal pasir ris then my ceremony is in jurong dorang takut kadi datang jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred err they don't have a preferred err kadi sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby ah so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the kadi punya tak
look at the kadi available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of kadi available you just choose ah say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the kadi who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this one you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that dah then you can boleh masuk and book the once your date is available you can go and book lah
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the kadi available
and then after that macam
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the kadi that I want but eventually on that day itself my kadi was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
err for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I err you can ask lina for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit macam tak sabar everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it kadi kadi I think there's only three or four
then everything else is naib kadi ya
ni wali punya thing
I don't think anybody does any kadi reviews last time of course lah ya
mmhmm ya you don't want to you don't want to macam yang draggy draggy until macam kasi trauma that kind of thing kan
mm sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause kadang-kadang macam the orang yang datang tak semua islam
you know kan that's that's one thing that for me also cause macam my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended err nikah ceremony with all the dua and everything with all the ceramah everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them lah
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good kadi but then sometimes you don't want someone who
I think I think the okay when it comes to kadi they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
put yourself in their shoes lah macam dorang
setiap minggu ada nikah to do
they will message you and then he will they usually the kadi will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
why he did that was basically just to macam ingatkan err remind you to bawa your err bawa then documents that you need to bring lah basically and then um some time then err he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp lah he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I um
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say lah then I say tak ah err banyak members dah kahwin then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so macam apa nak cakap and everything all I got it down lah
no need to worry but for some of my friends some kadi will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
ya ke but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script ah err post post nikah ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in err like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to baku ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school macam kau primary school your oral have to be baku kan ya exactly
okay so the initial the initial kadi that we chose um on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague lah basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before lah basically ya ya the kadi before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya um but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the kadi that you want and then set a date with
then turun ah turun err on whichever date that err you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the kadi ah macam oh err tunang saya bapa bukan islam then dia tanya like things of like how what is what's err um lah what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit lah basically ya
I wanted to get the kadi that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one kadi that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that macam
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so macam on the day itself if you need to do then oh semua dah siap
um I would say a lot of people nikah on saturday
a lot of people actually nikah on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate err double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married nikah on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
nak kena faham I mean from their point of view is necessary lah for people to for couples to be macam err ready I mean all these is like err basic rumahtangga punya knowledge ah right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
um civics you know like to for you to understand like oh if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing lah ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of macam very open conversations lah but I find it a waste of time for me personally
is not with the is not you don't interview with your kadi ya you do with with err the the head kadi who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
and the wakil from the bride
as in not not necessarily wakil lah as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought mak ah
I mean like it will be better lah right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought mak so ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether macam
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya err then he banyak soalan juga they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
you don't really you don't have a conversation with kadi until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the kadi
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything kan submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of err the the ustaz is there lah he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things lah I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and lepas tu
I think he asked mak some questions then ask lina some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two kakak there will be asking you macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada marriage prep ni eh err apa for you to go and then you like oh and alamak ni saya bila lah then for me right what happened to me was like dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh sign up ni bagus tau macam very informative and everything lah they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy ah so then after that then they will shut up
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi ah that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all macam a propaganda kind of thing like semua kena pergi you know like kind of thing kena pergi like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word kena you know is like kau kena pergi
ah you know like like cause like typical err like pasar melayu they will like say eh kau kena pergi tau ni
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word kena anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of err islamic laws what for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told alina macam I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage lah I mean to cut down all the cost lah basically like I was telling things things like like dulang it's not compulsory you know things like that then um a lot of the other things lah like red wedding cake lah the kompang lah all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
semua orang duduk kan and semua orang boleh tengok macam oh dia tengah potong cake err
you know but if you have a typical wedding macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan buffet kan dorang jalan ambil makan everything kan a lot of the times my friend potong cake orang kat belakang tak tahu then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple lah some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say oh I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it macam okay aku faham but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know macam if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
ya cause they know I I am degil usually lah when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the dia punya mak andam suka control
mak andam is the the the the bride's err makeup artist lah ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different leh like lina makeup artist makeup jalan mak andam is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife err one of them pakai scarf so the whole day the mak andam there betulkan scarf dia then the other one err what's that called makeup then everything betulkan makeup dia everything kan so
so then the groom's side don't have pak andam err I don't know I think it's called pak andam ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so um the the girl the they they rent the baju kan they rent the baju then they would they kain samping they ask pak andam it's all part of money making process lah
err a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same mak andam
cause people you know like oh ni mak andam aku bagus tau you know your makeup dia baik then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends one then always the same mak andam cause they will try to macam
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that macam aku aku need satu jam nak tukar outfit untuk err pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar makeup dia tukar baju dia one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so katakan all weddings eh
ya whole day so we so basically katakan lepas nikah you plan in your itinerary habis nikah pukul lapan setengah err let's say sebelas setengah your habis nikah sebelas setengah right but then you think is sebelas setengah habis err pukul dua belas tukar baju for the next half I can bet with you sebelas setengah nikah belum habis
ceremony nikah might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar eh dah pukul dua belas
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with orang nak ambil gambar every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing macam semua semua tak pernah I went to any wedding where is macam on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you macam oh eleven O five you come here like no point lah you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad lah you don't you don't macam because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five kita turun bawah eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know mak andam suka macam they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to selit as much time as possible so for example
for me ah I scold my friends mak andam a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing ah cause basically like say for my friend right
dia nikah kat masjid then lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did kat simei yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang to move off they want to move off then after that err I'm supposed to move off at err twelve o'clock so
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen eh no no now is eleven err at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty ke eleven forty five around there
then after that she went err she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the nikah kat masjid is the groom's side
the makan at simei is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum kita nak kena jalan sekarang tau then the groom's mum err tapi pengantin belum makan tau
belum makan eh lepas nikah everything ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan then she said err takpe lah nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga pe
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no kita pengantin makan then I told my friends to go and siapkan the food
she went behind my back again she tell the mak the mak err pengantin both sides eh err tak payah makan eh kita makan kat sana jer eh she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like err err tak tahu awak tanya salam that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how degil and how angry I can get err so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the mak andam cannot say anything lah she cause she want to turn back err she know what I'm gonna say already
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom ah right ah exactly kita dah plan dorang makan apa you want to tell them makan makan ala kadar okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the pengantin table then she sitting down there
tak payah tak payah tak payah like I no lah awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay lah okay lah you know
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty dorang belum start makan tau that in her mind by the time dorang start makan by the time dah gini gini aku tak ada time nak betulkan rambut si dia ni that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible lah you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the macam for me lah as the as the the brides err eh as the best best man I have to macam keep everything running lah ya
ya so those those are the things that for me macam important lah nak kena tahu macam
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be err end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he gi makan prata and everything I told him to go eat prata what ah cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like err suka hati dia nak makan lah he was kat sini ada makan apa eh you are like kau tanya aku kat fort canning mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai prata
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say ah macam you have to also macam recce how much are they charging you for rental lah because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own baju
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her mak andam makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her macam that is all on you
it's not a macam a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that one if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you macam maybe some makeup artists oh this is hundred dollars that one is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are sekali they make you look like a nyonya you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
mm ya but but like I say these kind of thing suruh dewi pergi Instagram go and stalk people lah
ah you can just search makeup artist or mak andam then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check oh wah her makeup very nice ah look very natural and you go see oh it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask dewi to message her alina I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram err for for quotations
ya not necessary mak andam would be worth it if you are planning to rent baju I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they macam oh because it's err package dengan empat baju cause it's err bride and groom tukar dua kali you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of baju
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the baju kurung you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own err western baju for example kan then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this mak andam then she will give you discounts ah that kind of thing lah ya they all have like their full package
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why macam your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to tukar baju from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and mak then that's it lah for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves lah
just to put at the front so when during kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah
orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after orang makan they can go to the park
at the same time you cannot expect people dah makan jalan ah is okay you also cannot expect dah makan jalan lah you know that kind of thing ah eh kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan lah you cannot do that what right
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also oh might as well aku dah datang pukul sebelas might as well aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the nikah all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like wah I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya nikah it started off with nikah alina seated alina seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no kompang or nothing what
mm ya dah habis ambil gambar kita makan ya
the kalau tak nak stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible lah but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was nikah
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like kau nak ambil gambar ni tak ah boleh ah sembarang
boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang ah like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be macam that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you macam he eleven oh eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten nak kena ke bawah eleven fifteen you kita jalan then like
takkan jadi during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take macam you have to tell the makeup oh you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time lah from mak andam we get I get that and everything but the same time macam as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time mah you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on oh this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know dua belas tak boleh ah but anything before that you want to change anything kira for me is like now you can be flexible
and you must also understand macam lepas dah nikah eh nanti ada orang ambil gambar
then nak salam that kind of thing kan and nak orang turun
dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok the tea ceremony
I mean that is considering is still during this period ah I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more lepak ah now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
tak no problem ah no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem lah
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me ah especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now tau macam yang datang members members kau sendiri then macam kalau nak ada bayar I mean you
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just err okay err dia they just ah okay ah keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come gitu gitu just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always macam felt that
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like eh kau buat apa I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee lah I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
you know the emcee who likes to takeover macam oh okay sekarang groom awak jumpa dia macam mana you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
ya I don't find it necessary lah I mean unless you what you will have a macam
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different lah but tak tak macam buang duit ah
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their mak andam and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche macam oh semua orang pose macam gini then kau pose macam gini that kind of thing you want someone who's like aku ada idea aku last weekend aku buat macam gini tau kau nak buat macam gini you know that kind of thing then like eh kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang in thing in thing orang semua ambil gambar macam gini
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side oh macam okay okay okay ambil gambar okay okay kiri kiri sikit okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya cause okay like um after the nikah I told alina I don't want to take pictures first lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu so parents come up here we salam then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties err came up first and then err they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of alina and then after that our photographer macam ya is ya we I understand all this ah they they get super excited ambil gambar dulu cepat before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan lina dulu
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought jom ambil gambar
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be macam okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me err salam parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps lah
hello this is recording pertama kita bersama saya wesley because this is our first recording okay I akan explain apa jer yang kita akan berbual so please bear dengan kita kita err recording ini akan berlangsung selama satu jam so every recording kita akan berbual pasal satu topic

okay that's very nice okay thank you so much for being a part of today's conversation eh ah terima kasih banyak-banyak and sekarang kita akan err bincang
jadi setiap conversation kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
atau lebih lah kita tergantung uh it depends so untuk topic hari ini kita akan berbual pasal
mango buah mangga any thoughts okay so bila dengar bila first dengar jer uh this word what comes to your mind bila dengar mango jer when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing apa jer
I happen to like mango juga so uh bila dengar mango jer kan macam woo sedap ah like
rasa macam wah
macam nak makan jer mango eh macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal mango jer macam nak makan sahaja so uh first jer kita uh bila dengar mango
actually bila first dengar jer macam rasa
I don't know if you've uh I don't I don't know if any of you dah pernah dengar ke tak but
the brand mango ni memang makcik I memang suka pakai baju mango this T shirt from this brand nama dia mango err by the way ini
tak sponsored lah eh so kita ya faham-faham jer
okay so what comes to mind bila dengar mango kita dah berbual okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay jadi err buah mango ini kalau kita berbual if we talk about the shape we are
um it's slightly bended it's bengkok sikit ke dalam kalau you tengok betul-betul
something macam apa benda ya shape dia so
mango ini memang interesting memang it's
we can somehow cut it well in a way that kita boleh makan betul tak
mm so kita boleh potong belah dua we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so dia macam kotak-kotak gitu so we can we can eat it like that atau kita boleh
kupas kulit dia and then kita boleh makan
macam gitu jer macam
apa uh we slice it we we can just slice the
and okay shape it's memang irregular tapi dia macam bentuk yang okay lah macam kan macam tak
uh selain daripada besides the shape
about one or two colours so dia ada colour yellow dia ada colour oren
and dia ada juga colour hijau so yang
okay selain hijau there's also there's also red betul tak
okay so err these four types yang paling banyak kita like the ones that we see a lot
usually the the ones that we usually see betul tak so
err yang paling sedap
I honestly tak tahu yang mana yang paling sedap because I've only tried
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so uh the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
mango where can we buy where can we find mangoes nak cari dekat mana eh mango ini
dalam context singapore eh kita boleh cari mango ini
senang nak cari sebenarnya it's very easy to find because
dekat mana mana ada like dekat setiap penjuru singapore mesti ada mango
mana mana mesti ada lah mango
kadang ah sometimes there are like fruit sellers that just
just so that they can sell their their fruits lah gitu jadi dia orang jual buah-buah yang dia orang dah tangkap ke dia orang dah
dapat ke tak tahu dapat dari mana but dia orang jual lah
literally dekat stations and
di dekat singapore ini like we all live err somewhat we we kinda all live near an station betul tak
err besides supermarket pasar mana lagi boleh nak cari mango
err as in it's very easy to find mango lah dekat singapore ini kan pasal it's it's a common fruit
product apa jer yang kita boleh pakai kita boleh cari apa um tak tahu lah
makeup makeup mungkin ada kot eh macam yang rasa mango I I tak tahu tapi so far macam okay let's say kalau macam product kalau betul betul ada mesti ada macam uh shampoo
conditioner yang rasa mango
ah lip balm pun ada
there's a lot okay okay besides like beauty products okay tadi we we were talking about
mungkin kita boleh talk about mango tea
teh teh yang berperisa mango err mango
banyak juga tahu and it's it's err
it has calming effects uh I don't know honestly mango just makes me happy maybe not everybody feels the same towards it tapi err definitely
I bet yang those of you who are listening to this you all already feel like you all definitely want to get mangoes right now betul tak
so err apa lagi eh
dalam segi product kita tadi dah berbual pasal beauty products kita dah berbual pasal
but kita belum sentuh ini
memang dessert paling banyak have you tried any desserts yang ada mango
entah eh when okay when the colour the colour of the mango kan yellow kan
bila the first thing when you see
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is betul-betul attractive
my attention to it so bila nampak macam colour colour bingsu like she said uh she mentioned earlier bila nampak colour colour bingsu macam
ee nak ah tengok macam the first thing I see is the the
apart from that I feel like dia consistency dia memang
memang cukup eh macam it's not too watery dia chewy dia macam
just nice ah texture dia dekat dalam mulut it's
macam it's it it it seems like she's explaining a little too deep but it's okay
I mean uh we're literally just talking about mangoes for the next one hour maybe we would just you know if we can finish all of the things that we can talk about nanti kita boleh berbual pasal buah-buah lain buah-buahan lain pula kan
okay jadi dari segi product kita dah berbual pasal bingsu sebagai dessert
apa lagi eh
um maybe itu jer kot maybe that's all we have for mango products err I mean
if we're going to talk about benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan there's definitely mango as a brand itu
uh itu macam
yang quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
cuma word mango jer kot I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like macam betul-betul macam wah nampak jer macam wah
uh besides that uh kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi mango ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu
betul betul I feel like ah okay but honestly I think err
ya you can do anything you want dengan mango cause I feel that
entah eh
the it's interesting that mango is the topic untuk hari ini pasal kita actually tak
kita suka makan mango tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
mango pudding we always have mango pudding dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari mango pudding especially dekat wedding
like at your friend's house mesti ada err
because kita tak pernah I mean jarang lah ya berbual pasal mango that's what I find it interesting kalau kita berbual untuk our first recording kita berbual pasal mango pasal
entah I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
tak pernah ada kan
I really wish ada mango soda
um that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time kot
uh do you know that uh in some parts of the world dekat luar negeri some parts of the world dekat tempat lain
the fact that dekat southeast asia dekat asia tenggara kita actually the king of fruits ini
so besides that uh okay the the scientific name eh untuk ini ini buah is actually mangifera indica
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit itu macam semacam buah itu the type dia nama dia stone fruit
kan uh ada berry ada apa apa semua then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because memang if you look at it
okay so it means ah okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so dia punya biji err biji buah dia itu memang besar
okay and mango itu actually juga native dekat india
dekat india itu
uh southeast asia asia tenggara that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
how interesting is that macam
lama gila seh like what the hell
now we're born okay at this point of time I have no idea what I'm talking about but kita go on jer eh
size dengan colour dia juga tapi dia uh lain-lain
an impressive nutrition profile ini betul betul
err mango ini memang penuh dengan khasiat there's like so much nutrition value value
means that err selain kita besides kita besides
and then apa lagi eh
okay in this website yang I dah cari ini dia kata err in fact studies link
err digestive health and eyesight dan juga has a lower risk of certain cancers
okay nak tahu tak uh nutritional value dia
okay so calories sembilan puluh sembilan
one point four grams gitu lah
carbs err twenty four point seven grams habis dia punya lemak dia is zero point six grams
lagi eh okay dietary fiber two point six grams
copper wah banyak eh dia punya nutritional dia copper err twenty percent of the folate eighteen percent of the
apa itu tak pernah dengar but sure seven percent of the potassium six percent of the riboflavin
thiamine four percent of the dengan magnesium four percent of the
okay err dia dia bilang dekat sini it also contains small amounts of phosphorus panthothenic acid
selain daripada itu mango pun is very high in antioxidants okay
okay enough in the nutritional facts we are left with three minutes to talk about mango and maybe the next thirty minutes kita boleh berbual-bual pasal buah-buah buah-buah lain lah pula eh
okay experiences dengan buah mango eh
I don't know every experience I had with buah mango is quite interesting because
I always have mango bingsu dengan kawan-kawan ke dengan siapa-siapa betul tak what about you do you have any uh interesting experiences dengan buah mango
um betul I think she's right
memang I think buah mango ini senang busuk eh and dia masak cepat so
ya just just bila dah beli itu when you
uh as uh your fridge ke tapi it doesn't have to be in the fridge also lah I mean orang tiap-tiap orang it depends right oh and err talking about experience dengan mango I feel that I like to cut up mangoes macam potong-potong mango habis taruh dekat dalam freezer
woo dah keluar macam
semi frozen macam entah sedap macam ice you know
betul that's I agree strongly dengan uh whatever that she said and also oh my god I can't believe I forgot about this
exactly itu pasal okay like okay let's just talk about it I suka mango ice cream yang dia dekat yang ada macam popsicle itu
oh my god bila you take one bite dia macam
wah panas-panas makan itu sedap seh macam seriously like that's the best
betul I don't know
cara you explain macam a bit weird tapi tak apa lah eh I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize kalau topic dia macam lame sangat but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
take a break from mango topic because uh whoever that is going to listen this for one hour mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal mango betul tak so let's hear about your day what have you done today
question dia tadi satu question eh tapi dah melalut eh tak apa it's okay
okay this week actually is my first week err since err holiday that school resumes so err as per usual I had my class today tapi because you know kan sekarang tengah pandemic tengah
tengah you know like the the virus is you know masih dekat singapore masih ada cases lah kan so today we had
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I pun dah melalut tak apa it's okay
okay back to the topic err seriously I think quite sad because dah berapa bulan seh dekat rumah like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive dekat dekat sekolah like my brain my work like ah I can just think and do work
much more than I can do work at home macam macam mana eh macam susah lah buat kerja dekat rumah cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily dekat rumah so your productivity level is not as
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that dekat rumah lagi err productive lah but today is uh
nothing too extreme nothing to some macam okay okay jer lah I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive dekat rumah ke or is more productive dekat luar
betul exactly
I had sambal fish and sambal egg
then err ada this apa nama dia macam soup petola gitu
dengan bihun bihun eh ke suun
I think it's suun this dia macam bihun but it's like um
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles yang dari japan so I think that's what it is then apa lagi eh um ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today um because you know uh work's getting really really stressful jadi macam you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then err lepak lepak dah itu jer
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about apa eh apa yang best eh nak berbual okay let's talk about our favorite music
um kalau kita berbual pasal
artist okay kita berbual pasal genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very err much the same as hers um it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean macam
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song lah macam okay that song is my favourite song
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have jadi macam bila dengar jer macam oh my god my emotions semua keluar but like
let's talk about the next genre my next genre yang favourite itu let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between err western songs dengan
however macam similar dia itu macam sama tapi lain lah you you you get what I mean
dia punya upbeat dia punya instrumental semua sama tapi it's just that the language probably different kot macam that's the distinct difference
okay and then um my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's paling banyak lagu-lagu western dekat kot that is the one that's very popular
I I would say lagu um
uh dah lupa tajuk dia
ah I tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini but
it's called mevoy M E V O Y daripada eh the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice dia
apa lagi eh ah oh ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I main asal asal jer
sebarang ah apa lagi eh okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is
entah banyak man I have a lot of groups that I like
then err okay I also because err this is my family is an um indonesian family so kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada indonesia juga lah so err
we would say it as pulau jawa
that's where we come from and then lagu-lagu from there is semua
variety juga eh macam they have err songs yang macam western western gitu dia orang pun ada songs macam ballad
dia ada genre genre ah koplo oh my god koplo my favourite genre
it's dia macam traditional gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat
lagi eh ya so that's my favorite music okay kalau let's say your favourite food apa what's your favourite food
I mean I'm I'm feeling it right now cause ya I mean tak boleh tak boleh avoid lah pasal kita berbual pasal makan kan so automatically as human beings kan kita first thing berbual pasal makan jer mesti fikir pasal makan betul tak
betul exactly but eh tadi you berbual pasal tenderfresh kan I tak pernah seh pergi tenderfresh is it
is it murah ke mahal ke
it's okay I mean err okay kalau macam okay err for me kan kalau makanan favourite I is
I categorize my favourite food dalam dua
categories tahu macam satu I like err
satu is comfort food dengan lagi satu is food
I okay comfort food ini kan is the the the category for comfort food ini kan is the type of food that I can eat
everyday tak jelak-jelak like
tak bosan bosan every time every time I can just I can eat that everyday literally tapi kalau macam let's say kita berbual pasal err the food that really like macam
okay so my first one my comfort food eh is bakso mi bakso I don't know if you guys know that
mungkin dekat singapore ada singapore definitely ada
tapi kalau dekat malaysia I'm not so sure dekat brunei pun I tak tahu sangat
but definitely dekat indonesia dekat singapore ada confirm
so that's my comfort food err mi bakso
I would have a lot of sambal to go with it and I also have ah pansit goreng
pangsit goreng in um english is basically just a fried wanton lah kan
I know it's like a little bit like whoa apa sia
but that's like really macam once in a while gila like when I have money that I'll get that
kalau tak no usually my friends would be the one that would bring me there treat me
I feel bad but you know it's a it's a good treat I mean kalau macam birthday jer kan macam confirm
confirm dia orang plan dekat situ situ juga pasal they know that I love the K
okay so now we talk about favorite food apa lagi eh

err apa lagi eh okay err since kita punya do you have any last words macam like you know to wrap it up
but I thought that mango is an easy topic to talk about kan macam senang apa nak berbual pasal mango apa yang susah sangat so but I I thought wrong so throughout the whole time it's a little bit like um apa seh
and they are english language which is what I'm really fluent in then apa itu
I juga boleh eh I pun boleh berbual bahasa melayu lah macam normal cause we're singaporeans kan I'm born here
um berbual bahasa melayu just a normal thing but kita pun boleh berbual bahasa indonesia because
my family's is an indonesian family so kita my
uh next fluent or I would say a native language would be bahasa indonesia actually
because uh that's that's how I was raised I actually berbual
um my parents' native languages like dia orang punya bahasa asal dia orang which is
err bahasa sunda dengan bahasa jawa so my mom speaks sundanese and my dad speaks javanese so
apa lagi eh
sorry alamak okay ah okay okay hang jap jap jap

so K ni dah tahu
tak lah macam okay masa you dah masuk dalam
ah then cause sometimes inside kan masa you tengah tengah scroll scroll sana tengah tengah meeting ke apa and then sometimes you just want to wipe
apa eh
you nak show you punya itu ke
sometimes kan cause they have the host kan host boleh share screen kan
ah sometimes then kita nampak screen si host kan abeh sometimes kalau macam mana kita nak macam
nak show kita punya ke ataupun I just want to say eh eh so this is mine then how do I show
ah tak nak lah
ee ee kalau okay first masa you join
then you taruk you don't want video
after lepas tu you dah masuk then after that you can you change to like you want video or you have to like rejoin
kena go out balik
no no but then ini when you first join kan takut you join with video or without video
cause so if let's say you dah you dah pilih okay no video
then halfway through you nak change boleh tak
but just now I remember tak boleh sini
ah tu masa starting lah masa dia tu
ye lah ye lah can can can can
ah ni mummy tak tahu
eh eh oh ni dia under kat mana more eh
dah record then aku kat mana
chat I tahu
ah tu ah tu ah tu tak a specific person maksudnya you hantar dia jer dapat tahu orang lain tak boleh baca after the whole tu pun tak dapat baca juga itu I nak
ye lah
oh okay okay macam mana
boleh choose okay okay this is one option yang bagus lah
ah macam mana
leceh lah eh okay lah okay okay okay
learning learning takpe tengah belajar
bagus juga eh
macam-macam juga function dia sometimes mummy tak pakai banyak
mummy just tengok macam you know just just listen and then and answer if necessary that's all
quite quite ada function juga eh
tu lah bagus lah must learn ah then I can use
ini yang hantar orang ah link tu eh invite people for meeting eh
cuma mummy rasa ni bagus sikit pasal ni quite macam quite user-friendly you can figure out lah eh kan
ni better I think okay lah quite okay manageable lah kalau you tak tahu pun you macam boleh agak-agak ni ke apa ke kan mm
ah lah tadi
ada macam alah macam team bonding ke
takpe lah cause of this technical thingy tapi tapi boleh lah juga
actually okay except for some people had trouble problem macam tiba-tiba eh tiba-tiba hilang abeh then
bila dia nak start something new activities kan then he they have to like everybody go into that uh use that that thing tu ada problem sikit lah
kita ada macam apa tu escape room tadi
ada abeh kita cari clue actually interesting juga lah
macam um kita used to go macam room kan tapi ni virtual tau tapi
it's find clues sama lah so instead of open up the box apa kan then you just virtually open the box the click and then dapat clue dia then you click newspaper ni dapat clue ni
you see ada
ah ye lah ye lah ye lah macam lah alah itu kan normal escape room macam you dah ambil clue then okay you go to different stages okay you dapat ni solve the first one
okay then you go to the next step then go to the next room ah then sampai the end okay then you solve the the problem
okay lah tadi cuma time lah you must go you must you must really ikut timing lah timing dia macam quite short abeh kita the clues sometimes you really have to like
really tengok apa dia sometimes kita ingat kan it's something cheem tau sekali alamak it's just that that first few letters of the the sentence then you can figure out okay actually what is it
tapi kita pun baca dia punya poem I thought the poem is something to do with the poem kita gi decipher the poem to know actually no need it's just there
tak macam dia nak kasi digit okay you click this okay in this room find the three guard three digit number for you to open up the door
it gives you seven like but then we were just reading the poem kita baca apa poem ni ada tree lah ada women passing by apa lah apa sekali takde terus after that I think we took some time abeh orang tu kasi clue lah actually you don't have to decipher the poem you just it's just there you just look at the poem
sekali one of us oh okay okay I can see number seven
but you baca macam kita betul we read sentence by sentence what's the meaning maybe you know tak ada tak payah you just baca jer kat situ you just see the number the S the E and V and dah
I think escape berapa eh tadi eh satu jam eh
I think satu jam satu jam ya
eh tapi banyak pe
uh actually ya lah tapi ada a few got four stages ah
tu semua sama pe
takde I just focus punya lah
I think so itu I tak tahu ah I think I think they created lah tapi
welfare pack apa

lima orang but still you have to keep your distance apa
ya so tak boleh lah
ah ye lah ye lah
oh bayar lah kena bayar lah ada ada

alamak abeh camne
buat exception lah
takde you macam mana
selama ni dia tak ada macam it's not strenuous kat sana punya macam quite
dia tak kasi you dia tak kasi you ni lah
tapi satu online okay pe satu online satu you dekat you attend dia punya uni apa
boleh lah macam you just do like you do you take like two double degree ke apa you do concurrently apa

tapi kalau kena kena waste lagi satu tahun tu
itu like so long setahun
ya lor sayang
ah some of your discount punya
tapi cause of good school banyak banyak
things boleh picking up apa

tapi you kena yang you kena pasti kan ni dulu
oh tapi macam tak payah pergi ini lah
ye lah
ye lah ye lah
tu lah doa jer lah mudah-mudahan kalau baik untuk you baik lah dapat lah
kalau tak baik tak payah lah
okay lah you dah you one year kan tu kan dekat
a'ah camne
but dia tu dah kena sack kan
ye lah
kena betul-betul sebelum you pasti kan
tapi already memang
zero betul pe dia macam
something like they not not take things lightly tapi macam
ya I don't know dia macam whether sikit
previous cases pun gitu apa
tapi betul apa cases macam gini kena betul-betul tengok
macam a few times dulu masa orientation punya program pun
mm but play along with such things kalau you you tak report report lah
ah tapi patut goes with other uni tapi dorang tak report
okay alamak leceh ah tadi dah sedap-sedap berbual itu lah dah nak dekat tiga minit kita berbual nak buang air liur jer
kenapa angelina tak nak ambil ini eh diploma in apa diploma in children punya studies apa
tapi it takes time apa masa of course like everyone I think like that lah I think macam eventually kalau macam dah get used to it nanti dah tak awkward apa
oh dah submit eh
habis izz nanti ni ah
ulang-alik ulang-alik ah ambil
kat mana eh poly mana
nanti kakak bulan tiga kakak dah start kakak punya course
kat bras basah and err tu yang course yang dia orang nak hantar ni advance certificate in earliest
ah dia orang nak hantar tak certificate tapi by right kakak punya actually I can
I can apply for another cert ah certificate in early childhood tapi kakak tak tahu kenapa the company sent me for this advanced certificate in early years which is err ni ah I think dia orang punya difference is
gaji wise
actually I prefer to take ace apa the other cert the pasal with that cert I actually can teach older children ah
pasal kalau kakak ambil one there's only a limit I can only take err handle kids two months to eighteen months jer
I cannot go for those older kids teach them eh curriculum tak boleh why kalau infant
kita nak ajar apa seh
tu ah tidur kasi makan
tapi tapi ah yang childcare aniq kan offer kakak dia cakap nanti after your course eh ah after you serve your one year punya bond with your company you come and look for me lah dia cakap tadi dia cakap dengan kakak
tapi I prefer here pasal dia orang punya
okay pasal every different different school they have their own different approach tau nak ajar so for this school is play based
my company they focus more on relationship base habis tadi kakak tanya principal principal cakap what is the relationship based curriculum
tak tahu it's just more communication ah with you and the kids ah so but I still prefer nya method because it's play based student learn develop through play
cakap habis dia macam ya whatever lepas tu dia macam why don't you come and work for me lah after your one year punya bond lah
I cakap inshallah lah lepas tu I cakap tapi the plus the downside is dia orang tak sponsor for studies the reason why I take up this company is because dia orang sponsor
go for it eh tapi macam
nak tahu juga dia punya pay wise is it
then tak payah kerja dulu lah since you like belum ada komitmen kan belum ada anak
just go for full time studies jer lah dah kumpul cukup duit tak if you dah kumpul cukup duit then you just go for full time studies better for you because cepat habis instead of that one year maybe six months
of course lah definitely lah that time kakak kan cakap dengan izurin lah kan yang masa korang kahwin kan I told izz if you want to apply for house I can actually recommend the agent okay the agent cakap dengan kakak for now izz tak boleh beli rumah yang
dia punya income now is actually not enough to buy a four room dia actually nak apply rumah four room daerah rumah kakak yang lama tu dekat kan
then err dia cakap then where can he apply lah but actually izz can only get rumah yang dekat boon lay taman jurong dia macam rumah lama old flat lah really old flat
ah tapi macam tempat dia pun not
cakap macam the area not really that
cakap tak apa lah then ah izz cakap tak apa lah tunggu lah tunggu then dah kahwin mana tahu dapat boleh apply
lagi ni but I guess I think sekarang market pun more for buyer punya seller market kira seller untung ah buyer kena keluarkan lebih sikit duit
sembarang sahaja lah cakap sahaja lah janji boleh hit that one hour nya ni minute
ni lagi satu nampak benda bukan-bukan semua pakai tudung jer aku tengok
itu lah I think kakak kak ika ah yang mak cakap yang tadi kita berbual kak ika ah menantu menantu wak jenab
toast belt toast box eh ah toast box ke apa yang kedai makan yang ada jual roti kaya ada breakfast pagi punya ada telur rebus
ah mak suka lopong dekat situ kakak tak tahu kenapa cakap dengan mak mak tidur ni tak jatuh ke dekat tepi mak cakap susah nanti nak nak sapu sampah cakap sapu jer lah
berat lah nak angkat-angkat cuba kakak suruh mak buang ni
this one dah lama sini masa kita baru masuk sini kan pindah was like in two thousand
two thousand berapa eh
two thousand one two thousand lepas kakak habis sekolah kan
two thousand one tak salah kakak kita pindah baru dah berapa lama sekarang dah I think twenty years
ah tadi angelia nak cakap apa
yang yang pakai ada bangs eh tudung
of course lah izz tak bawa pergi jalan-jalan macam mana nak pergi COVID
dia cakap apa tak cakap ah tak berbual lah
tu lah kak ika she's not a local she I don't know whether she's already converted to singapore citizen pasal dia dia daripada batam she's an indonesian she's an indonesian
but dia punya berbual you can actually know that she's not here she's not from here dia ada masih walaupun dia sekarang dah
dia dah tinggal lama dekat sini kan but then her accent still have that that that indonesian accent ya
dia tinggal dekat boon lay kan dengan wak jenab
ah wak jenab yang sikit hari yang angelina datang yang tengah duduk dekat luar tu yang kaki berbungkus ah wak jenab

err but she have three kids ah err tiga orang abang
abang baby nombor dua eh abang ram nombor dua nombor tiga yang bongsu abang baby
the first one tak ada
err because dia
dia ikut bapa dia masa cerai kan he followed the father the father is not muslim
I think dia covert then after that dia revert balik to dia punya original ah agama
err hindu tak salah kakak ah that's why dia punya muka ada muka india india sikit
kakak first kakak tak pernah nampak yang first anak first dia but but err second at the time mak cakap dulu mak jaga lepas tu mak cakap degil mak cakap buli ah buli mak masa kecil masa that time mak tinggal um mak tinggal rumah sewa kan dekat toa payoh so she brought over ah anak-anak dia

anak saudara bapa semua panggil bapa panggil nama tak panggil cik a'ah I don't know why until now tau habis kalau salam macam kita kalau jumpa orang tua kan salam cium tangan kan tak dia orang tak macam kawan lah begitu
pasal I think dia orang punya age dengan bapa punya age pun especially dengan anak wak masnah nak dekat sama macam dekat lah
nak tak diajar daripada kecil that's why bapa tak rapat sangat dengan adik-beradik bapa
mak pun tak berkenan sangat actually especially dengan wak masnahnya anak tadi kan mak cakap kan a'ah tak berkenan sangat ah

kena complaint lah kan sikit hari kan kita ada this centre planning day right ah last week so the the principal brought up all the feedback from the parents ah so dia indicate ada one of the parents ah teachers always on the phone terus kakak cakap wow okay sekali bila kakak jalan kakak pasal kakak keluar dengan lagi dua orang kan two more teachers so like the my friend was like pointing ah at my colleague dia cakap
handphone dia tunjuk tangan begini handphone lah this one lah this one handphone lah habis macam oh okay yang kena complaint dia orang lah dua ni
senyap hmm
sama sama jer like no difference jer like normal lah
ah tapi
tak lah okay jer
tak all the pregnancy macam okay jer tak ada apa-apa jer macam I don't have any anxiety bila nak beranak
macam okay lah beranak beranak okay lah lah beranak ah I don't know why some people eh macam very nervous ah nervous padahal macam tak ada apa-apa jer macam kan macam is it just me or what like err ya tak ada masalah apa-apa just like lay in a bit lepas tu cakap oh time nak sakit sakit lah but the first
I use epidural ah because they said it's very painful very painful I cakap oh I I I don't have eh for mesti tak boleh handle punya lah so cakap ah so when the doctor asks
nak pakai epidural tak then I just say go yes epidural that's why bila macam I mm mm I got one friend off of four pregnancies she never used epidural tapi dia cakap sakit memang sakit lah tapi bila bila masuk beranakkan anaqi
I didn't get to use the epidural apa
then lepas tu I macam it's not really that painful what a'ah ah pasal
err on that day itself yang err abang nasir nasib baik abang nasir tak kerja
so lepas kakak ada macam this craving nak makan sambal pizza sambal pizza ikan bilis tau macam Domino's nya that time so I ate that then macam sakit perut cakap ah nak berak dah tau padahal dah dah due date itself so tak terfikir nak patah balik hospital
so ah then kakak nak tidur lah cakap sakit perut macam nak berak tapi tak berak ah tidur ah tidur sekali macam bangun pukul tujuh lebih eh tujuh setengah like that cakap eh kenapa macam lain macam tau sakit perut macam nak meneran-meneran so I pergi toilet tak keluar pun eh then sakit perut dia macam semacam macam datang tiba-tiba sakit dia contraction cakap eh ni ah maybe this is the time lah
pergi dengan lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir I think we need to go to hospital send send the kids dekat dalam kereta kakak tak boleh tahan tau macam tak boleh jalan cakap eh sakit perut semacam lah
lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir ah err tak boleh tahan ah so along the way pergi dari sini rumah mak pergi
abang nasir kita kakak dah diam tau pasal abang nasir try to talk to me then I just like don't want to reply cakap ah err ya lah um macam please don't talk to me because I don't have the mood to talk I cakap itu ah so on the way I tengok kat tingkap eh bila nak sampai seh bila nak sampai this is like this is this baby is torturing me sampai dekat hospital tak boleh jalan so kakak cakap dengan abang nasir I think you have to get the wheelchair for me I cannot walk
so duduk dekat wheelchair ah sorong naik dekat labour ward
nurse macam tanya uh how is what is your pain score
I cannot say already ah err dia macam ingat kakak bedek-bedek tau cakap just a little bit ah cakap lepas tu dia macam hegeh-hegeh ambil my data err dia cakap can you walk no I cannot walk I really cannot walk I cannot stand okay nevermind lah I help you sekali dah pergi naik atas nak check dia cakap eh baby head come out already tapi kakak rasa macam nak berak ah ah sakit macam nak berak tapi kakak tak ada macam mm nak berak nak bersalin macam tu kind crying no no crying you know
so doctor err nurse masa tu doctor belum sampai pun
so nurse cakap you wait ah you don't push ah because baby dah keluar kan habis you cannot tahan apa so I just I cannot tahan already I rasa I want to push now ah cakap no no no no don't wait for the doctor first dia tahan kakak begini seh cakap no no no no sekali I don't care whoa terus menjerit baby keluar ah baby come out already ah lantak lah buat bodoh tapi actually tak sakit pada kakak
so then bila dah beranakkan aniq pun tak sakit eh sakit sakit juga I think aniq was like the less pain the least painful lah of one aniq I was like struggling a bit because tapi tak nangis lah it's just that tak boleh keluar macam I I think kakak masuk malam pagi pukul satu ke dua
then err sampai esok petang baru kakak beranak
kalau dah doctor nak ni apa pergi caesarean then I told her I don't want I think I want to walk because I feel like it's like I've been on the top of the bed tak gerak so the thing cannot go out apa
so I cakap ah I cakap dengan doctor ah can I just walk
no no you cannot walk you have to stay on the bed if not anything happen then we not responsible dia tak kasi jalan
tapi pasal I think about the same ah sama jer ah then my friend cakap pakai laughing gas ya use laughing gas tengok I don't laugh what
my friend cakap dia pakai tau kakak pakai macam biasa okay jer tak ada apa-apa boring dia cakap dia cakap ada ketawa dia high
ah then abang nasir pakat lah cakap you use this one ah tahan your err masa yang beranakkan aniq ni lah macam sama jer tak ada beza habis nurse cakap lah kat me dia cakap you must use properly you must inhale right then I said what I inhale I inhale what
abang nasir sampai dah tertidur hmm habis tak keluar-keluar dah keluar belum sakit belum habis check check the machine right kakak rasa macam contraction point contraction point hmm okay lah macam rasa tak tak okay jer cakap but the contraction got got some ni tau movement ah eh tak rasa pun doctor sampai keluar masuk sharifah how is your pain
cakap you sure or not you six already eh ya four
wah really ah good ah you cakap okay lah then sekali bila macam eh how come your dia pasal dia cepatkan dia punya ni tau err dia orang pakai oxytocin lah nak cepatkan dia punya err labour it's still the same
dah dah dah dah pecahkan water bag
letak oxytocin sama juga so doctor cakap if you are bad err I give you two more hours if by by this time ah if you never err have any pain err caesarean terus macam huh I don't want caesarean don't want don't want okay I will try I'll try my best
a'ah lepas tu cakap eh budak ni tak nak keluar kot tidur dekat dalam dah dah best dekat dalam
abang nasir cakap ni kalau tak ni kena pergi push bawa naik ward ni nak kena caesarean lepas tu kakak cakap tak nak ah habis dah macam buat kelakar habis abang nasir cakap buka lah buka habis dia tidur dekat sebelah kakak macam eh nak berbual eh tak ada orang tak berbual
beranak habis if your if your pain threshold is high
maybe tak sakit lah pada kakak pain threshold kakak memang high I got high tolerance for pain so that's why macam bila beranak macam tak ada apa-apa tak cuma I think that time masa first punya pregnancy kan orang mesti cakap sakit sakit actually macam tak apa
it's not really that painful then orang cakap sakit tak beranak actually okay lah pada kakak macam macam sakit sembelit nak berak it's just like berak-berak macam constipation that's all hmm
bising ah anaqi he's crying ah
that's why dia cengeng ha kuatkan suara dia
but you cannot just take anyhow jamu you know because err some sekarang jamu tak tak ada macam banyak mixture
err drugs lain so it's already not in a pure form
dulu masa yang kakak bersalin dulu yang urut pun cakap err jamu-jamu sekarang banyak yang campur tak authentic so that's why it's dangerous ah
because it can affect your internal organs apa a
mak lah selalu suruh makan kena paksa makan lah then have to eat habis jamu pakai jamu pill pill okay ah mak punya time lagi teruk jamu macam kena masak punya tau
I wanna go in november tapi now I think
ni I nak I I should tukar kan benda ni
ya kak ain and angah birthday
so apa ni celebrate together lah
malay food like nasi
but I think because of the adults itu lah I think ya
and then one room is me kak ain aryan and
my younger brother and then another room is for my parents lah so they can apa ni
since it's his hari jadi also my father
lagi lagi dia half price seh of the Pan Pacific tapi like okay lah like like we cannot be together in one room lah

you know like some hotel macam they the shower and everything is in the bathtub right but I don't want that but but I know Amara is not like that
eh no jap eh
okay ni
like dia kata like very boring seh
so I was thinking that okay lah either way lah like if uh adik want to if my younger want to sleep with
uh ayah and ma then go ahead

when I taste it I was like eh sedap seh then like
macam like this kind of food
bila dekat singapore
susah eh
I think it'll be my mum's err ayam lemak cili padi
because if I take that ayam lemak cili padi then can I can it be served dengan nasi or no if no nasi then I don't want it
because it need to be with nasi lah hot piping nasi
I think my I think my mum my mum's err nasi goreng
nasi goreng daging is nice also
I mean if a dish that like got everything inside like protein and everything okay lah then the nasi goreng I think is a good choice
telur mata lembu on top
but like macam like when you become her
tak tahu like I really seriously tak tahu why they need like banyak banyak bilik
like bilik dorang banyak tau like
or macam main hide and seek ke
dekat dalam flat like err

dorang actually did include
not kecil lah maybe when I was a teenager

ah dah besar he will need to realise oh eh actually I nak
I need to err jaga my atuk and nenek I need uh anything that
and I know about it happen because kita kat sekolah kan
ya ya ya that that was what uh apa yang I mean lah like

thing the most like macam paling sedih that I've heard

hari raya also coming in
macam uh macam apa itu I I I apa corak apa tema yang you nak
you just tampal lah
apa concept you nak
uh apa kayu jenis-jenis kayu you nak
uh jenis lantai
err jampi serapah ke
inspirasi macam err tema
tema contemporary atau tema
WhatsApp WhatsApp uh yang group renovation itu
ada gambar yang you dah hantar kat I
dah tengok juga lah ada baca-baca juga
ada ada design yang I suka juga
uh itu I dah
I dah hantar pada you mana yang I suka mana
apa itu design yang I suka you suka dapur corak yang macam mana
tapi kalau open concept itu
jangan jangan letak apa itu kena ada letak partition juga seperti gelas lah
jadi bila kalau you nak masak
ah tak ada minyak itu tak berasap ke seluruh rumah
ya betul
err orang yang orang yang apa itu membersihkan
mm dan dan apa itu
menggunakan uh vacuum special
I think beliau bercakap
dia cakap memang kotor ah macam minyak itunya bila dah bersih
kan air dia kan warna warna coklat
warna hitam ah kotor juga lah
then I macam I uh hari itu I bilang you lah kalau I nak you masak
nanti I boleh order menerusi ruangan yang ruangan lubang itu lah
nanti kalau I nak letak loceng
jadi bila I nak panggil you sayang
I picit loceng yang itu
no lah you not my waiter tapi
so you hari itu you cakap you nak you nak
uh harga quotation itu berapa so kalau within budget I think we can
I don't know whether want to do a partial hack ke or
or total hack ke
so itu kita kena tanya
kita punya lah what will be the quotation
you cakap you nak nak nak hack certain areas
dekat the platform
whether it's whether kalau within kita punya budget ah
ya uh ya platform itu pun dah
so kena tanya lah kalau kita nak hack and then nak pasang a new
baru punya platform
ah berapa akan quote kita
platform memang platform memang mahal
ah so kena
kalau kalau tengok lah tengok budget kalau macam terover
maybe just hack and just letak vinyl
letak vinyl
tambah tambah platform
oh dekat uh
uh dia ambil dari mana
bagus juga lah you ada survey survey tengok-tengok jadi you ada idea lah
ah nak nak nak
nak buat uh renovation lah nanti
it anyway tingkap itu pun kita tak akan buka
kita akan tutup what sebab you selalu takut ada binatang selalu masuk ke apa
I think yang yang yang sliding door okay yang yang yang sliding
sebab kita pun bukannya nak nak nak buka kan kita akan tutup jer
ah dia dah dah haus benda pun dah lama kan
uh so ada juga ah ada ada banyak juga design
nanti I I I ambil gambar dan kita tengok bila kat daerah sini ada ada cantik juga
dia punya apa itu dia punya tingkap macam ah style condo condo style
very nice cantik
you can consider tapi tengok lah harga dia berapa
is what kita kita mungkin dah dah bela dari kecil
sampai dia membesar membesar lama jadi dia dah dah dah dah sebati ah dengan rumah kita macam
dia tak dia pandai tau dia kalau kalau kita ada dia dia tak keluar tapi kalau kita macam tengah tidur atau apa dia senyap-senyap sebab
kadang-kadang nampak macam tahi cicak err
dengan err apa itu
dengan spray spray pencuci lantai semua
uh memang kadang-kadang tu kadang-kadang lepas kerja tu memang kadang memang memang nak memang nak bersihkan
err letih balik kerja satu hari itu kerja kita penat jadi
time kita kalau kita tangguh tangguh tangguh sampai
berhari-hari sampai berminggu-minggu sampai kadang-kadang is err isteri ya lah macam biasa lah isteri kalau
uh itu dia akan
ah ya lah faham-faham lah kalau
kalau kita tak tak tak buat itu faham-faham lah nanti apa isteri akan buat kan
memang uh ya lah I understand lah your your your fear your your concerns so that's that's why we are having this you know
the kitchen the kitchen apa itu
who halfway uh merajuk and don't want to come
ya lah dia dia ini
you know like malas-malas to to come
so emotional then merajuk
ya macam I bilang you lah uh err kita kasi dia orang arrange
kita kasi arrange yang yang rendah sikit lah sebab kita
mungkin will markup
or work kita punya budget so kita kasi them
arrange yang yang rendah sikit lah
actually ya lah macam lampu ini semua kita dah
uh kita dia punya cost itu kita boleh kurang kurangkan lagi ah
uh banyak banyak kirakan banyak juga lah kita dah tukar yang sikit-sikit ini dah banyak juga
so I mean sekarang ini yang the more yang lebih
tengok lah macam mana berapa dia orang akan quote
macam uh the the other time I I I
I tanya quotation ya lah macam toilet itu toilet itu kalau dua toilet
kurang-kurang pun at least satu toilet pun at least maybe three four K
dua toilet is around lapan K just toilet
itu sekali terus habuk kirakan termasuk kitchen dapur bahagian sana lah sekaligus ah
tak yang yang bilik tak yang master bedroom vinyl kita almost thousand
thousand four thousand ah seribu lima seribu
apa yang bilik bilik master kita nak buka
agaknya lah
kalau nak ya lah kalau nak buat memang
memang I murah sikit lah tapi I think leceh ah
tak apa lah bayar lebih sikit biar the biar yang yang yang the experts
ya tapi bilik ini dia punya flooring
yes dia sejuk panas sejuk panas ha tengok ini dah merekah lah
that yang yang
dia merekah nanti jadi macam ah master bedroom ah sebelum sebelum itu kan macam masuk air semua kan nanti itu dah sebab sebelah
sebelah toilet itu yang masuk air semua itu yang sampai terpecah
sampai menggelembung eh
ini ini bukan ya ini bukan yang
I don't think this the ini vinyl yang
so so so tengok lah
kalau master bedroom we do it around berapa eh thousand
so kalau mungkin dua bilik ini mungkin
oh mungkin dalam dua ribu ke agaknya estimate nya
ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate lah tapi that time kita pun kita punya budget pun tak banyak kan so kita buat yang yang urgent dulu lah
sejuk ah
kalau ada ada baby baru ke so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety dia tak keras sangat
kalau jatuh pun at least dia ada macam uh cushion this vinyl kan underneath dia ada cushion kan
then tak sejuk sangat
kitchen punya flooring
yang yang I I saw one of the picture you send
with the kitchen punya
but uh ya the one that we saw kak doro using I think wah

air fryer buat apa nak air fryer kita takde ke
okay lah tu murah kot ada warranty kan air fryer lagi
oh tengok oh tengok ah macam mana kalau masih ada sale tapi ibu tak nak beli apa-apa
oh habis tadi siang tak cerita dengan ibu
series main macam filem
kenapa suami nicole yang jadi suspect
serious kecohnya bodoh apa
habis kalau gitu netflix ada tak
lol leceh habis besok keluar dalam tak
tak habis-habis sia habis kalau gitu tadi balik tak nampak pun motor scrambler mana motor scrambler tu
dia hantar sevice apa
habis kenapa tak suruh full service jer
uh untuk motor tu
ha gitu jer lah dia tapi tu motor untuk abang ayie eh
ah biar lah asal dia orang dua bahagia lah
a'ah uh engineering informatics yes betul
dia punya is more on
uh engineer punya side more on not say maintenance dia punya more on testings
I not too sure because so far not much people joined using background ya but maybe I can try under rovers the one uh ya yang test setakat masuk setakat duduk from point A to point B back and forth back and forth for I don't know eight hours but not bad lah the pay that's I heard
I mean I don't know but I'm looking forward maybe work like abang azhar on hands on stuff on the component and stuff ya or maybe I dunno maybe in charge of there because I have a friend who works at as well ah he he works at dia kerja kat jurong uh water catchment area so his job is to keep track of the water level uh when it rises when it lowers err which areas going into rain whether certain areas flooded or not that kind of thing basically it's like
I wouldn't say call centre is more like a to overview uh every uh mostly entire of singapore like know the longkang and stuff like that
okay lah not bad I mean he is considered full time but they call him a intern cause dia masih dia orang sponsor dia orang sponsor dia sambung belajar
a'ah dia tengah ambil part time diploma
ya dia tengah ambil kat uh singapore poly because near to his workplace ya bayar sampai bayar sampai habis uh second year ke atau I forget I never got
but tengok lah macam mana
I wouldn't mind but I'm not too sure what else because usually people just know uh you know they ride by they saman people and then some of them is under roadworks they supervise construction site and stuff and some they handle ah like one my friend she intan at uh hers is under
dia bantai jer gaji dia besar
I mean kalau pun not bad uh dia sampai what two let's say you habis two forty five you extend what pukul lima pukul enam then after that
ya I think so oh ya ya yang tadi kita berbual-bual
ya ke ingat oh
five to seven lima ke lima tujuh ribu depends
huh murahnya
tak semestinya bising apa ada lagi benda yang uh
huh sebab dia bising mungkin kadang-kadang clutch housing kadang-kadang bearing kat dalam engine kadang-kadang piston banyak benda yang akan effect your bike
ya lah me lah I mean ha kalau boleh sebanyak-banyaknya ya tapi the reason I want to use is ayie's not say lumba your bike considered
untuk budak-budak err bawa motor nakal tapi you bawak terus jadi motor apek
okay lah kalau gitu how about kita share
apa X one apa uh oh oh class two A ke class two B oh two hundred oh
tapi tuan dia sendiri tak duduk bawa buat apa menyemak kat carpark
okay lah cuma at the same time nak kata nak kata sayang tapi
tak boring ke tak boleh bawa lebih dari enam puluh
kesedapan at the same time untuk keselamatan enam puluh bawa motor boleh jam boleh rosak takde ke fikir macam gitu
got a bit lepak ah in a way so he thought want to earn more money
no he he he was dead serious dia betul-betul uh dig through everything asking me macam
uh all three companies had deliveroo foodpanda grab apa dia punya benefit apa dia punya you know uh
apa uh akan jadi kalau gini gini semua so I ceritakan dia lah I was uh apa tu
I bilang dia macam
okay kalau foodpanda leceh dia kita kena book shift kalau deliveroo dengan grab uh anytime kita boleh start boleh offline
uh antara ni tiga company tak semestinya uh masing-masing ada uh dia punya
benefit dia tapi at the same time ya lah he tak boleh cerewet lah kita kena banyak sabar because
I pernah tunggu one hour for just one makanan so one hour you guys is like you working part time so it's not really worth it man actually I can earn
dia macam dia macam okay jer macam
boleh jer tapi at the same time tak tahu lah pasal motor tu kan pun under ayah
pasal dia malas habis dah tahu sekarang barang-barang dah mahal nak cari duit pula so okay lah pros and cons ah siang-siang boleh buat tak nak tapi understand lah maybe back then his workload was too much in a way lah pasal dia kata uh
ada budak baru masuk this and that so macam workload dia macam kurang tapi macam spread uh evenly ah so untuk dia
uh advantage ah pasal dia dah tak buat malam punya shift lagi dia ada pagi atau petang so that time dia pernah tanya lah macam
uh dia ada bilang dia punya uh cadangan dia kalau dia buat
kalau dia kena pagi punya shift lepas habis pagi dia dia uh ha dia buat delivery dia dia kayuh daripada
uh lepas maghrib ah sampai malam
tapi tak tahu dia akan buat ke tak lah dah cakap dah uh dia cakap senang ah pakai bag kau abang tak payah beli so you know lah your brother macam mana eh
huh ya lah dia dia berbual kat orang jer ah cakap jangan bilang gitu-gitu tapi tak tahu dia buat ke tak lah
ya tapi tak tahu lah I mean dia sendiri that time nak pinjam orang duit nak beli motor orang pun terkejut entah kalau tidak dia nak beli padahal dulu dia ada yang kat yang kat bawah dia tak suka dia cakap banyak problem this and that so I don't get his point ah
pasal tak tahu lah dah bertahun-tahun tahun ni juga dia sedar oh ni motor ayah tak boleh pakai suka-suka you know tiba-tiba rasa nak kasih balik tak paham ah dah banyak dah bawa berapa tahun baru tahun ni juga dia sedar tu bukan motor dia
dia tak kirakan dia nak kasih balik motor bagi kat ayah so dia beli motor sendiri after dah berapa tahun ya dah bilang dah dia punya tu tapi tak tahu lah dia
uh huh dia tak tahu bukan nak kata berbual tin kosong berbual tak betul
tak pasti ah tu kena tanya ayah mmhmm mungkin kot
then oh then that time apa abang ada tanya
uh he he dia tanya akak kerja grabfood macam mana mmhmm then I said lah macam gitu lah dia I uh I say lah the difference between us is that she only work during the peak hour I work almost full shift
you do delivery I think you fight with the customer or the vendor only then then dia terus bingit ah dia cakap apa maksud kau cakap memang lah kau panas baran macam gini macam mana
tunggu sikit lambat kau dah maki-maki how
tak orang tak takut dia kena buang orang takut dia kena viral jer
ya ada yang that time punggol budak-budak grab gaduh dengan vendor pasal tak tahu sabar I think it was some promotion lah then I think
ya jangan jadi viral I mean that we do even though people might might not remember
oh oh ya my friend my friend kerja roo uh this entire week then she managed to earn quite a lot lah even though
I mean kita dah layan hujan habis
bayar sikit jer you know so for roo to do that I'm very amazed lah
oh tak distance dia memang dia dia add on tapi ni dia tambah lagi because dia orang perasan somehow I think orang complain pasal hujan then you know safety and stuff so at least
worth it and you know macam berbaloi ah
ya for roo macam kadang-kadang boleh dapat lima belas so if compared to grab I have to take three orders tapi three orders pun tak semestinya I can get within less than one hour
ya waktu
macam tak masuk akal no she didn't she wasn't aware until I tell her ya because she works err when she wants she was so she's not really depending on grab but she just if you just work for the fun of but ya when I tell her this so for her to do actually heard about this to her she find it like she pity for the other riders who get affected by this ah because it's considered their rice work ah
bukan bukan apa zina cakap pasal terrorists ini semua
and this is why dia shouldn't come in yet
okay kejap so dia orang actually sudah kenal berapa lama
dua tahun they know of each other for two years okay
oh habis yang budak ini dia duduk dekat yang the couch yang facing apa
ah dia duduk dia duduk dekat the mirror side lah yang facing the living room there right
so dia memang uh friend of a friend is it
tak tak penting ah
ya and then dia cakap
so dia dia kalau police dia kalau finish a certain number of years bond dia dapat yang bonus itu kan
he's and and so he's actually macam upfront and really just
apa yang susah sangat yang izat tak habis-habis yang macam cakap ah habis kau nak tanya dia punya gaji semua kau nak interrogate kan tak payah tanya budak ini sendiri cakap
eh merepek eh
so what happen you tanya first ah
apasal kena dekat istighfar eh
ya lah tapi pasir ris pun ada yang akan datang apa
nak cepatkan kahwin dia ah
he still thinks it it was the right thing to do itu ah
ya allah okay so oh tak tapi ini yang ini yang revise punya plan kan
yang mak dia cakap nak dua tahun kan tapi kalau tapi dia cakap ah the original plan
duh itu yang kita cakap kan
oh my god susah benda ini sudah jadi so complicated in the last three weeks
habis you tak tanya mm pasal kenapa nak kahwin sekarang tak tak tak tanya tu
zina pun nak kena grow up ah dua dua dua
habis budak itu tak cakap apa-apa at this mmhmm
grow grow up masing-masing
huh maksud apa
oh okay maksud dia macam dia cakap macam dia cakap lepas kahwin pun boleh grow up macam how zina puts it ah lepas kahwin pun can still do this
but I I don't know how much dia orang faham of this growing up thing I think macam fikir macam oh it's just about career future entah lah
mama duduk mana kat sini
mama dekat kitchen apasal mama dekat kitchen huh
oh habis
did you say macam jangan sembunyi-sembunyi did you say that
ah habis dia okay jer
macam dia the leader lah you can quite see that there will be the the nature
so memang dia dua puluh lima ah
entah lah
habis you tak tanya pasal dia punya family
oh I know the the dekat there okay ya I was there last time
habis zina macam mana dia punya reaction malu-malu ah tersipu-sipu ah
habis dia tengok macam alim-alim type tak
ini lepas si ashraf itu sudah balik ah habis
habis this is when
mm habis
habis then you say
supporting lah ya dayah yang kena support lah
ah habis apasal taxi driver
tapi dayah but oh my lord macam like
dayah is at the stage of her life that she's driven and macam have a lot of aspiration
habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia educated ke atau dia kaya ke at the end he's just going to be having this err aura of like macam relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah eh uh tak payah lah berbual pasal ini okay lepas itu
macam it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband lagi worse kalau dia have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character ke apa if he has it okay that macam he might ask dayah to stop working and things like that lah
habis so you just say that ah
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya dia nak kena match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand pasal
this whole like family who yang macam oh tahu benda orang orang I don't know family ke sesiapa ah yang rasa
oh lebih baik err halalkan percepatkan
macam as if macam itu ikut sunah nabi okay they take that part of the sunah nabi of marriage but the other part of the sunah nabi of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like macam your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody yang macam that macam is complementary to like your personality
mana boleh macam like that ah ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack err macam complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see macam that is the thing that orang just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part nak kahwin cepat macam oh ah ikut sunah nabi percepatkan but part part lain macam
to get somebody that is competent with you ini semua tak tak ambil kira ah
uh anyway this boy the call you abang or what
he should be comfortable with it lah dia ada kakak apa
oh so that's when he call you abang ah
so the conversation dengan zina err bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar it's more of like what what did you say to zina pasal yang the growing up and then pasal pasal making a apa plan habis pasal apa lagi like what else did you address
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this ah kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena wake up music just just just use this card
kata nak kahwin kan orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu tengok sampai perempuan agaknya she will just be fed up one day tapi betul apa macam
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect macam do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
easy go easy uh macam mana nak cakap uh ah apa
itu tak ada pendirian lah maksudnya
no macam gini the thing yang dia nak kena differentiate is ada bezanya easy-going dan tak ada haluan this is the thing zina you are which one
easy-going atau actually you are directionless
you said that ah untuk si ashraf ini ah habis ashraf cakap apa
ah budak ini pun tahu ke tak the background of zina
so this easily two years baru meet up tahu
I mean yes macam I am thankful and it's nice to know budak ini budak baik err so like what izat say kau tengok jer lah budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia
ya lah ya tapi I don't want after this izat say huh kau tengok macam aku cakap
dia budak baik I hope izat doesn't go like this lah ya but anyway
entah lah don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
sambil lewa anyway what I was saying okay
I really don't know lah this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes macam to
push zina tapi I don't know if at the end of this product is zina will be
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want macam at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all zina loses dia punya identity because this she is she is macam dissolving into a very
ah it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia see that I don't know lah sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if macam she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that macam you know like ah a woman shall be like macam be led by a man that kind of thing and
at because at some point there will be a point that macam she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
no it's not say tak lepas tangan it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse faham
macam because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself tau this twentieth uh twenty some age
but dayah said yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang denmark itu
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff orang punya personal is to us superficial
then you tak cakap macam dengan zina
at the end of the day zina dayah is still your sister macam you know she still cares for you lah then you know like
maybe she you tak cakap lah why why didn't you say to zina tadi like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu
then bila you cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini mama and abah was there habis
apasal you cannot chat ini
my why is my recoding still err okay you continue kejap kejap ya my recording is kind of
dia ah habis nevermind lepas itu then she say what dia tak cakap apa-apa
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to izat ever since macam she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
and just because izat is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue lah cuba kalau the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat will be supportive pasal apa
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that macam don't say that
you are macam ah tapi ah it's not that she will see all this point
habis if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
habis cakap you're close to izat pergi lah suruh izat tolong ah
budak ni segan silu wow
but that's because dia orang don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to tolong them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it lah
but it's hard lah I mean it's also vary in age age difference macam I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
oh you also cannot engineer it what salim like macam you cannot be bringing the two of them together
habis expect dia orang macam uh to boleh berbual like at a very deep level mana boleh like it will also feel it's so janggal macam it was so it was just feel so weird lah
siapa lah
where there's me then baru ada
hmm dah macam dah macam project
hmm tak suka
I suka especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
tourist stuff dekat Sentosa
wait but you dah beli belum dia punya ticket
cari online ah I think ada yang ada twenty five per cent off eh
it's not so much the beach lah because you all are going to macam tempat tempat the attraction right
that's at Marina Bay punya tempat
you know the one yang kita pergi Marina Barrage itu hari oh because you took Jihan punya car um
before you sampai Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
ada air-con tak
alah are you going malam or pagi
oh ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau
yang your own is
oh tak de tentage ah
sebab kalau nak tentage you can take mine
orh ya lah I mean is at one corner lah if that's what you want kalau you nak orang tak kacau then okay lah
ours was quite open dia exposed ah so
uh given the circumstances I think that's not bad lah but I think I saw some of them duduk dekat nearer to the lift area that one tak kena panas sangat
but pernah tak
ya kalau tak pernah then better don't
Seah Im kat luar lah park kat luar
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him jangan bawa motosikal because if he doesn't bring his bike then dia rasa macam
asal eh normally we ya
but muka girlfriend dia muka poker face tak is it she can ah
following each other's plan can but kalau the partner like me like that last minute say don't want ah I want today I got I got cramp ah I decide not to go to Sentosa then habis
because marina barrage dia punya jauh tau
because because Sentosa tak ada kereta senang that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
I seriously think that's a good idea too because Sentosa nak keluar pun leceh
cable car then yang Carlsberg tu
yang pusing pusing the thing that pusing
then apa sia yang lima
I went I don't think I've been to the one yang dekat Singapore
Hong Kong I went to Bangkok tak salah eh with my husband once
but ya you share with me ah I also want to see eh since my staycation dah kena cancel kan so
ya then you make him jalan also
but I'm pretty sure dia penat from going for kelas mengaji okay that's wrong but
dia kat mana dia dekat  bukan Tampines
because kalau daripada Tampines actually it's a bit more difficult lah dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang kan
I see oh it's not like she go and jumpa him somewhere and then they
yeah ni macam papa lah
oh last entry dia bukan tutup last entry
bukan tutup so that means uh last
last entrance normally tutup one hour later ah
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because susah you really have to macam tak de
tak ada secrets out
berapa orang sia
for eleven that's mahal leh
um nasi goreng tom yum
you have to see you know whether you have to make oh but because it's a hawker centre tak yah buat reservation ah
habis lah
I think kalau
potluck ah macam picnic style ah
ya if satay by the bay let's say penuh nak mams kan then you find in that area apa lagi kedai makan [ah]
cuma now we are not at Sentosa if you at Sentosa then ada banyak options ah
dekat Vivo banyak apa makanan
no oh my god dorang ni
nasib Zaki beli berapa banyak water bottle dia beli I think about
enam tujuh ada mineral water
because now the weather like sekejap panas sekejap sejuk
sekejap panas then the next thing hujan
oh dia kulit tebal lah
korang tiga orang aje eh
no si
Shad sama sama group kan
okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dia macam one committee and then within the committee ada macam sub sub group ah
I can so dengan dia
ya ya ya ya ya ya I can see the long hair guy right dia punya muka macam
ya ya ya you told me also lah it hit on the wrong timing you say if it's next month maybe boleh consider lah
then kau sorang serious ah
ya that one we got no other eh unless you want to bring the the bapa and the anak and the
that time ah I see my friend pergi
like err kosong the whole you know where the
the one that they always do uh free dance dia macam dance on the road gitu
dia ada the road ah
that one dia pergi kosong lah
oh ya ya no I saw that picture first then you told me dia orang kena buang kerja
don't know I don't know you pay me also belum tentu I naik
like you know the restaurant yang no the restaurant yang ada kereta kereta tu lah the vintage car
cannot cannot be I tak kerja right I think baru start kerja kot
was it was it berapa bulan ah
oh I belum pakai tudung so that means yeah ya ya I belum pakai tudung so I think it's like the end of two thousand fifteen
first trimester is supposed to be like uh they say what belum melekat yet
the flower one dah habis
rezeki don't tolak
rezeki dah ketuk kat pintu knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
orh dia tak kaku dia tak awkward lah
wait dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah
lurus bendul lah that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
not lurus bendul I think dia tak nonsense ah
uh lurus
and that's the reason why dia kena avoid orang orang yang macam hypocrite
a bit meh panas baran
no no this this is what that darah muda
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know dah besar anak mak
once dia masuk primary school ah
you bloom into a minah or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
yeah I took a nerd path come on then balik lambat
apa people okay so in general people will think I'm one of those wild student okay balik lambat pukul tujuh pukul lapan
bila sia the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school
I jumpa kat Tampines mart
you know the McDonald's punya carpark masuk right ya ya ya ya
and then it's like auto know like the momemt we see each other okay come come jalan
not like macam accident every day also like that that one not accident already
I think he after awhile he gave up on us when he closed the door he sengaja he never
maybe I don't know less than hundred meter away he saw us already he tutup
then we run to the main gate masuk
no no no I cannot study at home nanti pergi library ah oh standard
sampai library pukul sepuluh lari book seat
sampai pukul dua belas dua belas lebih satu between that time
dinner after after study at night we go for supper huh tengok
 macam mana badan tak naik
I will black blank out if you tell me besok I told you what I called my mum
uh hello mah then she said ah ada apa
asal Qin
lepas recess ada ada test I didn't study
you stay back right kalau ada your you do after school hours right
apa eh apa eh I buat
I buat I buat acrylic that's why I'm thinking apa acrylic yang I buat I did something
we even have a apa
dah buat dah buat uh okay for example there's
dah buat maths dah buat science dah buat geography belum
art you dah okay and then the other person oh aku belum buat ni okay okay okay okay uh it when is your class we copy later then we do rotation ah
okay finish now siapa nak dah habis siapa nak
uh apa dorang panggil
there is there is I I'm not officially on there but uh apa I represented
so basically kat batu dorang buat macam it's something like chess ah dorang buat ni yeah
he didn't allow us to go in tutup
let's go cabut cabut come let's
cabut I said ya so we took step you know step step by step by step
the first guy said naik naik naik naik we went out
maju lah she she's
uh ya ya ya nevermind so we took our time lah since dah kena marked also right we
I think second last day ya then we walk okay ah kena buat detention first time in my life ah kena detention know then I was like
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health lah kesian budak ni ah bila bila bila
eh tak kan mesti lah miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that I think
kita nak buat buat seh
um you mean before COVID where I wanted to travelling atau lepas COVID nak pergi mana
kalau before COVID
um I won't say most value for money tapi dekat
um dengan dia lawa
ya tu ah I think ah that time I pergi in twenty
sixteen tu I pergi um
okay ah I tak I didn't get to enjoy
tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah go camper van dekat dengan go
uh australia I rasa kalau kita dapat camper van kat new zealand
confirm lawa gila ah
tu ah tapi ya lah macam macam ah jadi kalau macam
kita punya camper van berlubang
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay lah tasmania best lah sebab dapat naik the ocean liner kan travel from melbourne to tasmania tapi
um sydney dengan sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family yang follow jadi
rasa macam best ah sebab you enjoy more with them
ya lepas tu yang kita you makan kat perfect catch
tu pun best ah fish and chips by the river power sia
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to punya fish and chips fish and chips
punya lah tak sedap
ya I went to new zealand dengan my aunties lah and my cousins
err well uh bila you pergi dengan um makcik-makcik ah dia orang punya level of err worry is more because they feel that they are responsible lah for you
I tahu ah tapi bila you dah dengan makcik-makcik I
err dia orang dah eh tak mahu lah tak mahu lah
dia dah pergi counter dah pergi bayar
alih-alih he was walking on the platform
it must be ticked are you fit ada sakit apa-apa tak you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera benda-benda macam gini semua biasa lah kena fill
so they give you a cert lah to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and nah ambil kau punya cert
so kita dalam kat new zealand maybe about one or two
my cousin and kita pergi pub
tak tak minum ah eh ah kita pergi pub ordered hot chocolate
kita pergi pub pergi pub err hot chocolate tengok bola kat luar
tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan it was raining
um and then bila esok pagi
sekali tiba-tiba um snow fell
lepas tu bila when there was snow err we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
um the advisory was tak boleh drive on the road dulu
and then um apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow yang christchurch um felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so macam lama gila ah lama tak boleh snow macam gitu
ya betul I think that was the first time I rasa snow
err unique experience ah sebab
tak pernah nampak snow kan so
ya ya ya we memang kita tahu it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves lah
err not for snow but I mean just winter kita tak tahu pun there was snow that was gonna happen
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana
the tour company decided okay nevermind we err board the bus and lepas tu drove to another hotel
and um ya we basically tidur kat hotel baru
tapi yang tak bestnya pasal new zealand
um winter obvious sejuk lepas tu
winter sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis
semua benda semua kedai dah tutup then so it was quite boring lah for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that wow at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but tengok so it was kind of boring ah but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night ke two extra night
so hot chocolate ah sedap
tu bukan lah tu some pumpkin spice kan
dekat queen victoria market kan
ah eh tu biasa pasal kita terus makan donut dia kat luar
wah camper van experience lain eh I think
mm ya lah I think by then kita orang macam dah penat I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then uh by the time nightfall kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal lah having wildlife a wombat benda yang
tak pernah nampak kat singapore tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk camper van
melampau jer
ya tu pasal lah
kita tak akan dapat experience benda-benda macam ini sebab tours chances are
ya and I think um partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life sebab
sebab your time is yours
I think yang even on that trip lah yang we kita turun tengok the river delta kan ya
tu ah tak tak sabar tunggu ni COVID habis
lepas COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination lah I'm don't even wanna go
ya tapi kalau you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
jadi kita kasih lah orang yang nak fly fly dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi
kita pergi apa yang kita mampu jer iaitu K
ya tapi okay so there are two ways to go about doing it biasa orang drive
lepas tu tidur rest one night and then esok pagi just sambung pergi border of thailand
ya that one more relax ah takde kelam kabut takde macam rushing for time
drive ke tidur semalam
lepas tu ah pergi penang
nanti lah belum buka tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar
selangor tengah highest for COVID numbers
ya so boleh ah lepas tu lepas dah tidur satu malam pergi penang satu malam baru pergi thailand tapi tu dah kira dua hari ah
kalau nak cepat then tidur penang satu hari esok kita pergi thailand ataupun lagi nak cepat terus to thailand ah tapi penat ah badan sebab it will probably be macam
empat belas jam on the road ah so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired ah
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand kalau the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
lepas tu travel around southern thailand
err I don't know ah tak pernah try tapi jangan bawa kereta ah jangan bawa kereta in
you sewa kereta dekat thailand
kalau bawa kereta sendiri then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring lah so what I want is kita save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore ah
naik kapal terbang nak sangat kan kapal terbang ah naik ah kapal terbang
okay lah memang best lah tak cakap tak best tapi
tak lah bruny boring lah kirakan macam boat dia kecil apa
oh tu juga
bukan bunker lah cabin lah
okay lah tapi malam we kita tak travel malam so you were travelling at
I mean bila kita baru-baru masuk when the boat started to sail
by the time kita dah tertidur boat dia probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled lah kan when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat lah
then bila pagi dah bangun
lain okay lah I mean dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi I think because of the space that they have
and harga tak so mahal lah
ya because they are fresh produced ah benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap
memang lah
tapi tu ah since
oh dapat dia orang yang burger ni macam best ah
okay sabar which one do you prefer you lagi suka van diemen's punya ice cream ke you lagi suka gelato messina
van diemen's was ya betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah farm
macam-macam ah gelato messina ada macam-macam flavour
tapi yang amorino punya
amorino punya I think kita makan
kejap I tak ingat whether that one were trip ke
ah tak salah tu ah
ya I like messina better sebab I rasa
ya tu yang best dia ah
because kalau you you compare van diemen's van diemen's punya flavours are
it's not anything out of the ordinary lah macam K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
kan atau
K lah apple cranberry pun boleh katakan
ada apa yang dekat tu dekat tom's palette
okay tom's palette ke gelato messina
ya ke
but then tom's palette sedap seh
tapi it could also be the fact that
benda tu kita tak pernah try ah contoh eh contoh
when we went to borong market alright K break your head right
I I wouldn't say that sebab dulu dunkin donut pernah ada with their bavarian cream
tapi the the ones that dunkin donut jual tak sesedap ah
ya okay so kalau you imagine ah break your head you punya donut the dough is soft
inti dia penuh kan
which I am inclined to agree sebab about I haven't tasted
tak pada I macam lebih pada okay like
I felt that it was a cross between lemak cili padi dengan uh apa thai green curry
ada lah iras-iras dia
dah dah lepas tu I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den ah dragon's den dragon's den is this uh british show
investors yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak shark tank ah macam shark tank ah
so dragon's den dengan shark tank lebih kurang ah sama ah
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not ah but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted kirakan you bagus ah
ya okay think about it eh kalau you kata you miss the food overseas
no lah just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you cakap oh I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay lah when travel kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example macam
macam makan kat noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
right like like mi dengan
ya so if you were to think about it again macam is it really that fantastic
ah tu ah faham tak
ya it's the spices sebab dia orang okay imagine nandos
so nandos kan macam oh nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam up sikit
kan ada sudu garfu
that thick milkshake sedap gila
tak boleh replicate ah eh so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop kita masuk
K ah penat saje nak duduk
and baam sedap gila apa tempat ni
betul juga okay lah maybe I think oh what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the ni lah factory outlets
tapi tu bicester village elite ah up ah
bicester ke bister
bukan bicester eh
ya but I think the york punya outlets err better ah
york yang kita punya kita punya camper van um battery mati
tak yang job dia
ah kita dah
so kita travel all the way up untuk pergi york
that's true lah tapi macam travel untuk two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that macam mm
ah tak ada theme park ah
float apa
bukan luga kan
tapi tu mahal ah I rasa
mahal lah I think
tak salah adults
fifty alah fifty australian fifty sing ni lebih kurang sama ah
maze kat sana ah
haunted house apa
eh itu mengarut seh
eh tu mengarut gila buang buang masa saya pergi tu
ya lah tak menyeramkan langsung
sabar ni trip ke err
is partly because of the weather kan they humid tapi dia panas ah
so walaupun masuk hutan err I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
tapi bila kat dalam panas juga ah sebab takde angin ah
compared to bila kita travel dekat you ingat tak yang kita pergi tasmania
cari waterfall
yang kita cari waterfall tu kan
oh ya K ah at least bila kat dalam sana
dia sejuk sikit oh
cuaca dia orang memang sejuk so kita tak rasa sangat ah
kalau nak pergi taman negara berpuluh lawa ah saya confirm
err at that time two thousand eight tak salah tengah euro euro two thousand eight ya tu ah euro two thousand eight lah
ya kalau kalau travel as a student
how much you are going to spend so macam for us while kita pergi sana we either just took the
atau kita ambil um kita ambil apa the the budget flight ah
so we were from netherlands kita travel to belgium via bus
kita dah terlepas the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
jauh I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium lah mana belgium is germany
so kita terlepas so konon-konon nak naik taxi ah the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks ah ya
tak juga ah we were winging it lah
ah ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab lepas tu
kita cakap dengan pakcik ni ah driver we need to get to this airport so dia kata that sixty kilometres away
at least macam
so you macam dah alamak macam mana eh but the worst part is that we will we had no money ah there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
no bukan takde duit lah but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang lah kan
habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita hundred and this one ah more than hundred twenty euro habis kita dah duit dah sikit then kita macam alamak macam mana eh
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and nanti I will show you all
dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya trip ni lagi mahal lah
ya lah I I think sama ah macam benda ini juga so dia on
dia on dia punya meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter dah naik two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
lepas tu he said
ya and then dia kata okay you look ah at the meter
sekarang dah hundred three hundred and twenty euro aku off K aku off
ya starting tu dah adventure ah
no but I think kalau spain kalah confirm raih ah
ah but because spain won err I think I think through penalties eh spain menang italy and then ah because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the um there was a big screen dia orang err live telecast
so kita ramai-ramai ah kat sana sama tengok live telecast lah
the trains tutup sia
jalan ah
ah jalan ah so tak ni lah ni dah madrid ah ni dah madrid so madrid dah macam
lepas portugal so kita pergi
so it was netherlands lepas tu ambil bus pergi belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal pergi um flight to madrid
all the way makan ni ah roti dengan tuna ah
tak lah everyday but basically living frugally ah
um my friend and I lah kita dah dah dah lapar ah
so kita turun kat kedai muslim ni kita kebetulan found a muslim shop which was nearby
you go through your hostel dot com ke apa ah
so um jumpa ah kedai kedai muslim ni ah semua muslim brother dah masuk kedai dia apparently kita ternampak ada prata ah
prata ah so macam prata ah
so I don't know whether it was ah an instant prata or prata that they made ah tapi nampak macam prata ah
so my friend and I eh baik ah this harapan prata puas hati lah kan
tu kita dah tengah lapar so kita minta dia enam ah enam eh kau tiga aku tiga lah enam
itu tak perasan lah sebab kita dah tengah lapar ah and harga dia harga tak mahal sangat lah
true dah tengah lapar ah so kita dah okay ah enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar and he couldn't speak english
ah macam gitu ah so dia ah sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu
then macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar
apparently dia orang makan order prata dengan macam sirap ke gula ah
tak I think they tuang the sugar on top ah
so kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik
tu pasal lah dia ni dia ni kira macam muslim brother boleh pakai punya ah
and then uh you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita keluar um maybe like after one or after the two
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four ke two to five ah
so it's okay lah as in dia orang tutup sekejap for them to rest lepas tu dia orang buka sampai maybe sepuluh sebelas
oh err in madrid juga I where where when we were walking ah masih masih masih
sekali tiba-tiba there was this bangladeshi guy
kita dah kat madrid eh dia orang bual bual melayu eh muka bangladesh berbual melayu lepak
ada pernah kerja kat malaysia
I mean if the opportunity presents itself nak lah kan
kalau ada kerja yang bagus okay ah
ah lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana I mean
kalau kita kat singapore kalau bulan puasa kan macam
okay ah first kita berbual pasal regarding our hobby lah okay ah so you can first what is it your hobby
cakap lah macam okay example like kalau for me my hobbies is ah I like to read books I like to travel I like to
ah mostly spend time dengan kawan-kawan ke apa ah that is my sort of hobbies that I like
ah I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai I don't really like it
punya brand tak ada you don't have any other brand yang you suka ke apa ke
kan and I think you also suka Coach
you pun suka
ah quite lately lah I think that daripada dulu pun you memang suka Coach if not just lately
ah so apa lagi yang you
you apa you minat selain daripada bags
okay because for me ah whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore kan pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak
we apa more like
terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu kan so
important the family makan and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa it's edible lah boleh makan and there times yang you masak pada I is
uh fantastic lah it's good juga lah kan
takpe lah the more the more rounder become most to most
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore nak main bola dah susah I I try to ask my friends to play all
with sharif if the kid maybe can can be done ataupun
I think in terms kalau
ah the whole society punya makeup pun dah changed I think now we are
kalau kalau passion the thing is passion is there
budak-budak cuma only have
to ah play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is lain
kalau sekarang ni when people play is
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if macam
now like dulu kalau kita nak tengok internet pakai computer will really stay in front of the computer
tapi now even with handphone
kan contact the people pun
tak ini lah so the
itu lah the changes in in time eh so in order to survive
ah mentality zaman dulu punya kan tak nak handphone tak nak pakai
ah internet kan I think kalau sekarang ni if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
ah I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be apa terlalu ke belakang if let's say we are too far
have to have to try lah kan tu kadang-kadang when we try pun
susah juga nak nak catch up kan but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that lah kan okay sekarang nak
berbual pasal apa topic lain
kita takde lah travel banyak-banyak tempat kan ah so for our travel is mostly to
ah if not we will be like apa every year at least lah
I think bila kita pergi tu apa boleh
so hope macam apa we can
so biasa lah pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa lah
what are the ah pattern what is the perangai yang kita boleh
ah click atau tak click what is our
err kalau bawa
ah apa
ah yes lah you can ke depan lah
takda lah at least kan
ya when we first sampai the hotel tu
kan bila kita sampai
bilik tu macam okay everything go like so olden
kan ah ah so after lepas dah the bilik tu okay lah but overall
so sometimes kan you have to buy kadang-kadang macam apa
because ah dorang tak jual
so that's why kadang bila kita when
dorang beli to sell at their shop ke apa kan
nak pergi ah
itu bukan itu aja even someone who
to kasi duit
then dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua kan ah
itu lah kan so other than that
ah indonesia juga bali juga
and your dengan best friend you ah
down there pun our friend is a hindu kan
boleh tahan kan tapi dia punya
ah hotel ada sikit ulu lah
ah kan ah pendalaman
tak kotor sangat tapi to me is ah
kotor juga lah kan
ah big buses tak boleh jalan ah um
in terms sana another thing I remember pasal bali tu pasal kita apa
yang sebelah atas tu eh
gunung apa eh gunung eh
ah gunung tu it was fun lah
basically macam atas tu sejuk it's like going to genting highlands
ya cantik memang cantik but the place tempat makan tu it's like all the buildings
so I wonder ni selamat ke nak duduk sini
kan ah I remember going to the toilet pun it's like
ah like a ghost movie punya punya toilet masuk
dekat situ nampak eh toilet ni senyap jer kan tapi pasal nak kencingnya pasal kan nak kena pergi
pergi jer lah kan but luckily it's only me lah I think if he want to go
kita just duduk and talk
ah a'ah near the swimming pool there so talk dengan raja
so ah nasib baik tu satu jam eh
ah banyak juga lah topic boleh berbual takde
we don't clear all macam apa nak cakap apa we talk
ah kita apa
um ya dia datang kita punya wedding a'ah
kan kita travel dengan dia eh quite a few ah kita pergi penang dengan dia ah
banjir ah
yang bestnya pergi rumah P ramlee tu dia punya
a'ah sikit-sikit lah tak semua lah
uh huh kita respect lah
dia kawan ah P ramlee dia kawan P ramlee dia pernah hidup dengan P ramlee lah so roughly dia tahu P ramlee punya sejarah tu macam mana
jambatan bridge ah
sekali pergi ah he got fear of heights
pusing gitu jer uh huh um um
komtar penang tapi itu pun apa apa macam
ya so dorang tutup that one is the
even the penang chief minister pun ah minta tolong dengan
party kan so it's that bad lah kan tapi
memang nasib kita baik lah kita dapat pergi
but I remembered lah yang kita pergi sana tu
mana-mana kita nak pergi tanya flood ke tak flood ke tak kalau dia kata um ah longer way uh huh
so macam kalau apa even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building tu di apa
a bit macam odd lah something good
kan kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia
food museum then there is the upside down museum ada the three D three D museum ah basically is the
basically is err apa taking pictures
punya opportunity lah tapi kalau nak kata museum macam gitu
upside down museum I think dekat singapore pun dah ada upside down museum ah so nanti mungkin kan kalau with the apa
then kita boleh pergi lah upside down museum ah
ini bukan apa ini is so called macam apa lepas gian
kan nak travel tak dapat dekat singapore kita boleh lah buat aje lah
boleh enjoy ke tak itu lain cerita lah kan bab kita a'ah the fans ah our friends pun ada kat sana kadang kita travel pun kita suka bawa our friends kan ah itu lah that's the good part about apa
travelling lah kan ni dah tak travel and the thing is ah dah tak travel tu satu hal then with this COVID nineteen
a lot of restrictions tak boleh lebih daripada lima orang ke apa kan abeh kalau nak kawan pun dia empat orang
kita tiga orang dah dah lebih kita tujuh orang kan so is susah juga lah kan hopefully tengok ah hopefully the COVID nineteen punya apa
vaccine can be found nanti kita boleh go to phase three maybe phase four kan
um macam bosan juga lah kan kalau kita kita pergi mana-mana just kita kita nak mingle with other people pun susah kan
ah so that's why kalau kita keluar
kita pakai glove kita pakai mask kan ya lah pakai glove ah
ah touch anywhere kita pakai glove kan kita pakai disposable glove
kita pakai disposable mask anything disposable kita pakai lah to prevent from all these ah
bag tak boleh disposable kalau beg disposable
ah cari topik lah kan
okay for me kalau dua puluh dua puluh satu my wish is kan ah
okay lah anak kita pergi sekolah agama he is able to cope
ah then other than that ah hopefully rezeki kita bertambah lah
ah apa tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people pun move other parts of this one is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family pun move kalau kita punya situation kan and got a kid
to jaga kan to jaga we got a special needs adik to jaga kan so but okay lah I think it can be done lah it will be difficult sacrifice perlu dibuat kan cuma hope to apa
hope lagi banyak benda kita boleh
kita will work out lah kan
the vision is clear kan ah our vision is clear kan of course kalau budak susah nak faham kan
ah tapi kata orang pun kita lead we lead kan most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out kan so kalau macam
of course lah kadang ada orang selfish apa kan so if
that person selfish tak nak cooperate kan
I will do it lah tapi kalau dah tak boleh kan
kau get into masalah
kau suruh aku handle aku I feel tak
tak ini lah tak apa tak adil tak adil kan so I will always go for fairness
leher ah
yes the neck tapi macam the neck only can show where to turn
kan tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang decide nak turn atau tidak
ya kan so sebab itu kita as a keluarga we are as a unit kan so we want to move we want to move as a unit
kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini kan then kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat
affect tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah then
really have to apa explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue lah kan so the issue now is whether dapat settle ke tak
tak tahu hopefully akan dapat settle lah kan
dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal lah kan I don't want to halang
kalau dia nak kan kita akan we are
in terms of nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap lah kan
tergantung it's very susah lah then
semua dah buat kan
kan kata orang tu kan
but now the organisation bukan satu tempat
they are two different organisations so yang ini tempat check
ah masa depan
for future yang ini untuk apa
ah dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain so
whether it will improve ke tak
tak juga dia different criteria kan like example kalau macam
ah apa in order to apply for example ah to apply for need
ah certification that he is autistic then dah pergi minds minds dah certify dia dah ah settle
then after that nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula oh
certification from uh minds tak cukup
ah doctor lah doctor or hospital or what okay so pergi doctor punya hospital
happen doctor hospital tu pun ah okay lah willing to help okay he did that part
then after that bila nak apply for apa for apa cash in life for home caregiving kan oh
cannot we only we only accept those who are apa
risiko there and the the thing is
okay lah macam cakap macam macam kita ni
macam for macam untuk adik ni
I am willing to usaha kan and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support lah
so kita kena buat kan tapi macam you try imagine
kalau lah all these checks
yes correct and the thing is pula
kita pergi check up ni bukan free
everytime pergi
ah kena bayar ke apa kan but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds tolong
percuma free
ah even the hospital one happen epilepsy punya doctor kan so there is no extra charges lah and
ah so nanti Q cure ni kalau macam apa
in order dah dapat cash in life lah apa ni semua cash in life lah pula nak kena assessment kan
and then the assessment pun need another set of ah check up
kan lah so memang susah lah tapi
ya lah duit apa
kita bukan harap ah ah at least dia improve
istimewa ah uh huh
I think for him is my target for adik is apa
kan kita bukan I'm not expect bukan expect dia boleh
pandai kan macam harapkan dia apa dia dapat
he can enjoy kan of course dia punya enjoy not
macam kita macam kita enjoy oh kita nak jalan kita nak travel kan dia punya tak dia punya enjoy tu
simple something that dia suka
dia feel comfortable sudah kan
ya lah tapi kata orang tu apa ye lah cuba kalau mana tahu kalau dia improve kan
dia punya epilepsy dapat
ah which is now supposed to be terkawal ah kan tapi
tu yang payah dia lah susah dia kan um um um um
ye lah proper food um um um um
budak-budak ya
tapi orang tak tak pandang dia begitu orang treat dia macam apa
tapi tu lah macam kata orang tu apa
treat adik with respect lah walaupun dia istimewa kita make him part of us kan janganlah lebihkan orang luar
abeh anak sendiri pun treat
macam apa kan kita try to make eh dia suka apa kan
bother to find out apa yang dia suka apa yang dia tak suka
apa yang dia comfortable apa yang dia tak comfortable kan
ah bukan setakat
ah apa marah ke apa marah
kan dan dia pun tak tahu apa yang dia buat salah kan kita susah nak
nak cakap kan
mengganas ah
dia tak dengar lah ah ah
um tapi tu lah
kita cuba jer lah kan hopefully everything goes well
hopefully is a better year hopefully boleh travel
kan mungkin short trip dulu
ah bawa adik sekali
ah dapat duit banyak kan gaji
jadi kita boleh apa boleh do
banyak benda yang baik lah bermanfaat bukan sahaja untuk kita
tapi untuk orang lain sekali ah for now
mm three wishes eh okay firstly I rasa I nak jadi billionaire
jadi billionaire I feel secure
can actually solve a lot of problem macam if like in case of emergencies like
macam accident ke apa I have the money already
I can like feel rich you know like macam jalan sana jalan sini eh I like this stuff I can just buy I like that stuff I can just buy that kind of thing
so I want my own transport and rumah
so like what you asked right I rasa transport I nak motor ke kereta ke
I nak my own private jet so that I can travel everywhere
tak payah nak tunggu flights pun
like I want to go here and there I can macam eh sembarang eh aku nak flight okay aku naik aku punya private jet that kind of thing
like also kan macam bawa orang lah like can bring you and like the other families to go travel all that
ya so macam tak payah buang duit gitu macam you know sekarang kita nak naik plane pun nak kena bayar for the air ticket right
have the private jet why not I just macam families let's go like I can
I can payung you guys for
transportation ah eh tapi duit belanja tak
I want to conquer a lot of language so macam
ada skill like that kan
like what's you skill oh I can speak a lot of language gitu macam but I want to speak like the common one lah macam mandarin uh korean it's like
common sekarang then
kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam nice right like
since it's a wish right dia macam bukan macam magic gitu kan kalau magic gitu kan
eh sudah aku nak letak magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need lah tak payah
you know about yang seratus dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
or like amusement park ah all that ada tourism
you want to picnic ke nak overnight
rather than macam
kalau dia dua ratus lebih then
you can only use your your own only kan abeh bayar seratus lebih gila
maybe we can picnic ke apa right what you said picnic then kalau kita picnic pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak
macam hotel then chalet ke apa kan untuk staycation gitu kan mm actually not bad ah I think the idea is not bad abeh kita boleh barbecue lagi kan kalau kalau kita macam
chalet ke ah kalau macam chalet tu boleh barbecue pe
and then macam rumah okay rumah maybe like macam if it's like four hundred we can just
so it's like satu orang like berapa berapa puluh dollar gitu or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars gitu
untuk makan dengan minum okay ah nice then we can just cook or we can like macam chalet or what we tempat dia boleh masak kan so
we can just buy our groceries ke apa
then we macam simpan dalam fridge then esok tu breakfast boleh masak
semua then
I think by lunch gitu we need to
because right takkan kita nak buat macam so called birthday party tak ada decoration ke apa kan
I mean we can buy macam dekat daiso ke apa kan so dua dollar dua dollar murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat neighbourhood kind of shop kan
so I'm not sure if kalau mm but it's a nice idea lah to macam
buat both
because we can macam save up a bit of money rather than macam
satu birthday party lepas tu birthday party lagi habis duit then
tu confirm confirm kena bayar lagi eh service tu
nice but I don't think macam I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own macam
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation macam like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
we should use chalet or something rather than that because macam
kalau ada rules or regulations susah ah kita pun nak buat macam we want to save
cause sekali tak save eh uh government pula
ah ya lah like some agency datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih eh
err macam
ada rooftop like that ah
not not really rooftop dia macam not rooftop or shelter tapi macam indoor sikit
ah we can we can find the place around there so kalau hujan ke apa kan kita tak kena
because marina west coast east coast tu semua is all
so kalau hujan ke apa we still boleh lepak depan situ
for a picnic with my friends we actually macam
abeh okay maybe kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita pack up sudah hujan lebat kan
because it's like alah sikit-sikit jer point point point
gitu jer kan
I mean we got the what is called ah yang besar tu parasol eh
ah yang payung besar tu
we brought that also so kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ we letak so
ah macam ada what is it macam terpercik eh is it terpercik macam hujan kena
if we macam takut hujan splash on us then we put the uh the payung besar
mm even though we under the macam cover kan but still lah we just
kita tak kena ah pasal kita letak payung besar tu
macam glamping is it dia macam wait ah
I don't think dia orang akan macam
err kau nak stay pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu I don't think
I think that's good though but rather than macam we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
err take macam morning like that no we should like macam petang petang gitu
we should rent from petang petang
sampai ke malam like that so sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu ya we should rent that kind
so that macam
but I I don't know kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu skate macam you don't know how to skate kan
abeh kalau aku roller blade sorang eh sedih sia aku orang semua cycle cycle cycle aku eh roller blade dengan aku
oh I remember that time my eh my cousin our cousin our cousin said nak pergi zoo
merepek pergi zoo pergi zoo tengok binatang jer
both of us we don't really like animals macam hey kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok jer binatang tu
maybe aku tak appreciate ah but
I seriously want that instead of macam pergi to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
gila I will just research about it later lepas tu nanti kita tengok
cause I felt like kita macam tak spend banyak time
yang macam cousins we don't really have much
I'm like I'm schooling all that macam all our timing clashes so we don't we have the time to macam jalan-jalan together
we can actually macam save up a bit of money ke apa eh lepas tu pergi shopping ke
macam nice right
ya tak berapa lama kita plan eh picnic pe picnic engkau dah dua tiga tahun
I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
I mean I'm okay with it cause it looks it looks nice the one I just googled just now it looks really nice and I felt like macam
eh macam best jer tempat ah gitu
if I'm not wrong kallang ada
mm tempat stadium tu
I mean kalau hujan ke apa kau tetap boleh climb apa
sama lah aku goal tahun ni
nak healthy lifestyle
healthy ke benda jogging tidak malam siap kerja makan
oh but talking about tu you know just now eh just now mampus you know that time
I wanted to try dia punya rock climbing
cause I rasa macam eh long time seh tak rock climbing why not eh
malu ah kalau jatuh ke apa eh orang keliling nampak dah lah rock climbing dia dekat tengah-tengah dunia gitu eh
embarrassment lah lol kat kallang wave tu kan
we can also macam watch movie also dengan dia orang
eh do you do you think the one that you suggest ada ke apa boleh kita tengok cerita lepas tu
makan makan berbual berbual lepas tu lepak-lepak eh
tak payah ah buang duit ah
I thought this one dia orang dah sediakan tempat tak ke
they sediakan already right they they have their own designated punya tempat pe
so I cakap lepas tu kan like what you say lepas tu kita cycle kan so pagi-pagi boleh cycle pe
dah cycle kita pergi mcdonald's ke
ha gitu kita pergi makan breakfast because we only bring makan untuk dinner dengan yang so called small celebration tu
then morning cycle cycle tu semua beli makan breakfast tu semua then after that
if they want to play at the seawater suka hati ah kan
I thought of like I don't know if I should bring my guitar or not but then macam
chey minah melayu sangat ni if I bring guitar and then
and then you play guitar macam eh macam dalam drama eh
but nice and then we can like macam take video photos
it's either kita macam nak balik rumah ke kita macam nak continue to other place ke apa not bad ah
tak payah nasi ah merepek picnic picnic nasi nonsense
no lah but since it's picnic I already know lah takkan I nak tu buang ni
nice if kita since kita nak buat macam birthday party celebration that kind kan
we could have just bihun goreng and nasi goreng eh sedap
is it kita nak potluck gitu
kita bawa makan dia orang bawa air ah kita suruh cousin kita bawa air
ice since dia orang nearer ask them to buy ice cube also ah
huh cucuk what
gila kalau semua benda kita dua jer yang buat
ya that's why I say dengan kita dua nak buat macam macam jangan buat kelakar
you know you talk about macam letak dekat skewer gitu kan
instead of letak kat skewer tu kan then we can just buy you know yang macam selalu orang barbecue ke
orang birthday party ke apa yang besar tu
ah so we put everything kat situ
ya lah so mi dengan nasi letak dekat situ tapi yang macam nugget ke ayam ke crabstick cuma
tak payah letak belakang lah
but I think we can do macam benda lain I mean
I I thought of like macam
buat roti sandwich or
or apa eh tu nama
I mean you say macam tak nak everything fried fried what then macam tu semua I mean it's easy to do but
whatever lah I mean tengok jer lah if if I feel like doing it ya I will do it
mm actually okay ah boleh ah one one dish jer ah lepas tu kita buat yang you know
uh we buy it's either we buy or we just find yang besar gila punya tupperware tu kita buat yang
buat satu jer lah tak payah buat dua gila kata
goreng goreng ni sambal goreng pula lagi tak payah lah
boleh boleh actually not bad can
air I think air
we are going to like have birthday celebration ni semua from
today to the next day what so of course kita perlu air pe
now like that I want like macam then we half half ah macam one is the normal drinks then uh macam
half is normal drink half is err carbonated one so macam sedap ada orang nak ada air sedap
oren oren carbonated
ya because he say it's better to just buy there lepas tu pergi pe pasal murah pe belakang
boleh lah beli a bit of chips chips yang kita nak okay maybe the chips that they buy is not the one that we want or we can just discuss what kind of chips that we want ah
but then even after we discussing obviously we need to buy the one that macam semua makan pe
so macam if you like macam like me
I sometimes feel macam oh without this I cannot sia I need this snack ah macam gitu eh
so so so I think that one nak kena beli sendiri ah
then mi oh I think oh ya I think we also need to ask
I don't know mi hoon goreng ke
mi goreng kuning ke okay ah anything can
I thought you cooking the nasi goreng
nasi goreng cina sedap eh
you masak nasi goreng cina tapi you campak ikan bilis
I help you potong ayam
okay lah boleh boleh ask your husband lah
dua packet untuk ramai orang memang tak cukup
tapi kalau kau letak sayur macam dia dah macam-macam pinggan like that what macam bowl
okay then like that takpe kita suruh dia orang buat sandwich tapi dia macam gini
lepas tu uh the tuna
ya ya what I mean dia punya roti
roti dia kalau ada crust suruh dia orang potong crust dia
lepas tu crust dia we put inside one of the plastic and then kita boleh buat
roti gula ke apa with the crust
the crust is very easy to do what setakat
crust tu kita setakat uh letak
so that it's easier so and then you can uh apa tu masuk dalam air fryer
masuk dalam air fryer lepas tu you jadikan macam snack keras keras sikit gitu
then you can just make roti snack or you don't need to
uh apa tu you don't need to air fryer or what
ya I like mushroom ball so we buy mushroom ball and instead of fishball and then nugget dengan fried chicken right
terlebih fries nanti soggy
okay ah I think we cun cun nice already ah everything we plan is nice already so I think we can tell them
instead of the one that we want to staycation tak payah lah buang duit lah
kalau kalau glamping tu mahal sangat
kita lepak kat tepi beach tu jer
letak mat kat situ ah lepak jer kat tepi okay ah
nice plan we both of us plan is like cun already
we want to go out picnic we tell them already what so but then kita kata maybe kita should go next year
during kak nadiah punya birthday dengan sambung together with abang punya birthday
we just said that but we never say about macam kita punya surprise birthday party what so okay ah dia orang pun tak tahu
they need because I think like macam whatever they like ah or need
cause I feel macam
okay lah then that one we can bring dia punya husband or something you know or someone else or adik dia
we can bring to buy to pillih dia punya dress ke apa because
kita punya taste tak ada lah sama sangat
oh ya so I don't know if we should buy denim sebab denim mahal
so tak tahu ah kalau kita nak beli denim beli denim kalau nak beli dress beli dress
colour code untuk kita waktu kita pergi picnic yes
since kita
since kita pun nak overnight right so kita colour code dua hari ah
but tak nak black ah common
I want red actually but I felt like kalau hujan macam mana
petir guruh ke apa ow aku takut
takpe ah suruh dia pakai baju kat dalam lepas tu yang tu tak payah butang
tu I don't know ah but we can just discuss with them later since we already discuss everything
so the colour coding later we can just ask kau orang ada colour apa kita ada colour apa ah
okay I'm actually very stress lah pasal the my wedding lah
that was the initial plan err tapi entah the situation can change you kno
err kalau we we I moved to his house kan at least nak pindah to our new house it's lagi dekat lah I mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the barang</malay
mm then don't know lah to him like if let's say I move to your house as into your parents' house eh and then like rohana because kesian kan the the the budak macam</malay
tak kan nak share satu bilik perempuan lelaki unless they are willing to build err bunk bed lah which actually they are not sharing a bunk bed err we have seen he's not sharing a bunk bed with the brother is two separate bed cuma share bilik saja</malay
so I thinking kalau if we move to my parents house the
at least I am staying as in sleeping on my own you know at least ada bilik and the house is bigger then dia pun dia pun cakap like oh ya ya I agree also but then the a bit the cons is that it's all the way to the wes
ah itu dia macam takut not really takut lah like you know too dah biasa tinggal kat east and then you have to come back all the way to the west afterwork y
ya it was to be a combined wedding tapi due to budget lah kan um
maybe consider to do two separate size lah so cuma no doubt it will be cheaper but then it will be leceh you know because we have to tak kan I went to do both side at one place so like as in maybe one place to be different are
aiya ya just basically just a bit susah lah
yes but then tak semestinya we have to move in straight away after we get the keys right I mean it definitely there will be something to consider macam like like what mother cakap is to do renovation for the kitchen you know have to put in cabinets and everythin
oh that one I didn't check err because the only thing that I check was that if let's say um we get married later if let's say I get married in early twenty twenty three and will they still give us like time to turn in the marriage certificate ke tak</malay
ah because err I know there are the the protocol is I think if I'm not wrong lah six months atau three or six months to submit the certificate either before your house already or after that was like dulu lah s
entah but they did say if he cannot commit to that timeline then you can appeal but no guarante
yes yes but then um one thing about the the is florida kasi ready ready like err provide the flooring err basically the basic stuff is already there just that of course kitchen is bare lah
err tapi I mean because we were so focused on the flat itself we didn't think about before that you know because when we apply ah it was actually just for fu
it was just for fun so err tak sangka that we get an appointment and then w
move forward then after that that's where we started to plan oh uh wedding macam mana err how to plan and everything because is like I told you righ
his family is very big bigger than ours so all the saudara mara dah besar besar how about lik
the budak the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is satu famil
ah okay okay but then like going back to the wedding part eh for twenty thousand for one thousand person do you think is double ke tak</malay
I mean with now at this time it was is now twenty twenty to have two years to plan technically we have to already set aside some money because by next year dah kena deposit you know o
ah okay but then I mean ya lah whatever you face last time was it's good to know I mean who knows sekarang pun is about the same tapi we do have like thoughts abou
memang okay memang we did consider to do separate which of course yes it may cost less than just do combine but to think of it right i
kita buat kat bawah block ya let's say for my side ah
I kita buat kat bawah block you have to consider that oh catering and decoration may not be under one err one company we may be separate and then err apa ni like you have to thin
that okay location you have to be one thing one err price and then your deco one price okay catering one price and then like macam you know that the the fundamentals like you say like compoun
mak andam all this separate lik
for me I think like oh because kita buat combine and it is a location that can provide a lot macam for the one at orchard righ
and if you want kompang then that one is different thing lah then the only thing that I have to worry about is um the ride
uh the bridal and photography but if let's say we took that away because kalau boleh I want t
satisfies satisfy my parents so you know lah my dad punya thinking i
you know that budget right make it a small nikah and then just makan makan lah after that which actually my mum say oka
but then you know lah my father got problem so and lagi pun</malay
good wedding ah is really really great lah so macam entah jus
okay ah if let's say we don't do combine we do separately will be it will not be fair to him lah because he will definitely have to fork out more first on top of the duit hantaran and everything like his family is very big right so you have to cater more peopl
and then also we have to consider vehicle costs err to ferry to each other to each side lah so at least kalau macam at one locatio
of the after that you want to change outfit just go up or this area have like a fitting room whereas for like kalau buat two separate locations if let's say you want to change one outfit at thi
site then change another outfit at another sit kan susah and then kesian the mak andam kadang kadang I'm not thinking for myself lah I am thinking for other people so y
that's why lah is really really hard for me to think about this lagi lagi two years is actually very fast confirm very fast I don't know how to move from there lah from now lah
I mean I get it lah you told me to work on it tapi the problem is I have been discussing like
parents lah all about these tapi I don't know whether he did discuss with his side because lik
kita banyak discuss within each other its tapi entah lah when I told him to go and discuss with his parents then macam</malay
okay okay boleh okay but then like no news you know after that so it's always m
either me contacting her mum uh his mum atau she contact me to get update because he don't tell her anything so how to work on tha
at least alah dah biasa makeup sendiri is best to you know biar orang kat orang makeup kan orang kan lagi pun</malay
ya the mak andam dia punya at least they have experience you know in doing wedding make up and then also cannot take it already lah eh the cost also is a lot but then to me should not eve
I'm not say concern but just tutup one eye lah for the because like it's for a big day you see so you shouldn't worry about that and lagi pun</malay
uh tapi kahwin sekarang
itu pun okay no doubt her big plans changed ah but at least they get to save money you know like whatever deposit right it's whatever the um th
planner is helping lah so like for example their they will supposedly do the combined wedding then it will suppose to make bawah block lah
but because now really very hard right so the err dia parents cakap okay never mind I'll help you find one location they actually recommended hotels lah
so her concern is that eh bento box mana cukup like is a malay wedding tau you will tend to eat more tha
usually you do but so you is you limit to one person one bento macam is not fair but they still paying the same price as the normal buffet so she was very worried about that lah but then because of this eh err she had actually got enough as i
ya of course lah you too just want the nikah but the
knowing that we're number one in the family so can I live up to certain expectation you see ah lagi alah I think because the his mother also macam</malay
alah mak pak dia dah tua so he she's been trying to push him to get married lah so I don't know whether that means that oh just cepat cepat kahwin then dah or just want to make it a big even
because lah ya lah like you mention that I'm still considered an uh outside outsider kan so I mean kalau boleh I don't want to masuk campur lah whatever happens because it's not my family ye
tapi kalau orang tu tak nak bual bual dengan mak pak dia nak buat macam mana I mean kalau boleh I tak nak masuk campur bu
if she keeps coming back to me I have to like whatever out of respect what ah sebab ini pun ya at this time pun is good lah to get married cuma</malay
definitely lah now you kan confirm ada yang macam kenapa tak jemput and everything and then they don'
understand that you know it's it's not by choice I mean tak yah by choice lah but then there's a limit to the choice s
if if kata that err you want to invite a certain family member tapi sangat jauh actually like four hours is like already long lah kan
kata orang kalau tak jemput tentu telefon kata kenapa tak jemput kan family jauh tu jauh lah tapi tetap i
jauh in the sense of distance lah not is in terms of family tree so macam like there was one example that my friend she just got married like uh think two months ag
err)she was apologising to ah semua like ah sorry ya tak boleh jemput sebab kita nak limit kat family jer then we all macam trying to reassure lah tak apa lah kita faham</malay
we can just view via zoom lah I mean no issue what tapi ya tapi you all are like my like my friends and also macam I feel bad then I was lik
you don't have to feel bad about this you know because you had you are the one who decided to continue this you migrate islam kalau boleh jangan lama lama kan don't delay right but then alah since they actually tuhan dah dah tau eh
so it's not good to delay any further so she is like never mind lah just get ready lah but err but the downside right you cannot go do outside is still kat rumah so limited to I think fifty person right termasuk her family so she was lik
she was happy to get married but then she is like macam sedih because only family is there ah no friend so macam like entah lah I don't know lah whether she still feels bad or not uh so she's been trying to like you come lah you come over to my house lah we will have lik
makan makan session or something but then of course due to schedule lah we cannot commit to certain times right y
because we are considered err sekarang first time righ
ya like like okay lah you can like still had ya know tu I will have to discuss with my own parents but then he will have to take the effort to discuss with his parents also lah and once th
ya you know you we know what we want as dah bilang the parents then at least bila the both sides nak jumpa to discuss further at least they know what we want you know and then
I mean other than that the another one's stress factor yang for him is the duit hantaran actually until now I don't know the difference oh duit hantaran and mas kahwin</malay
so that means so that means it's kalau macam untuk pasal wedding ada yang kasi gelang ada yang kasi cincin that one is okay is i
and then for hantaran that one is considered lik
no no no not the barang hantaran but duit</malay
cheque kosong dah melampau kot actually kalau let's sa
maybe because of all these uh hantaran right I didn't actually eh one post kat Facebook um this err is like a page lah where people can send in their stories anonymously you know like macam those magazin
got married um in iBloom apa ni belum</malay
as in it's not faded lah drag until like baru baru juga lah and then um bagaimana tahu that the husband have a lot of hutang</malay
on top of the wedding tau because it seems that for what I read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because dah kenal lama</malay
sejak dulu so they they feel that okay lah since dah kenal lama kan and feels right to move us into to continue with the you know marriage ah so maybe because it'
err macam it's not like they are prepared to go ahead with the marriage is they feels that is the right thing to d
so because of that kan dorang kena ada hutang and then some more at the same time dorang nak dapat rumah which I don't know how lah so macam</malay
the way that she have raised in the story is that dia macam stress like dia yang perlu kahwin tapi you know a lot of things happening then o
then I just found out also my husband have his own debts you know like err bukan apa ni bukan</malay
err loan daripada along lah its like those err school punya fees then dia minta bank loan for study he eh from what I read leh he the husband did investment so investment hilang duit</malay
so because dia tak boleh bayar I don't know lah all this thing I I don't understand lah so so she's like was asking pendapat lah like then I saw a lot of people that why in the first place you go and marry that kin
you know you when you're not ready to so there are like people defending her there are people who are citing her so macam to me like I agree with the people who are defending and citing sama kan
ah against her or citing her so those yang against her right are like macam you kno
a lot of people macam kenapa awak kejam kat dia is her choice whether she wants to go ahead with the marriage and not but to me I personally I feel that if you don't have the money then don't do it lah
tak kisah lah sayang ke kenal lama ke because I've had err friends eh who actually tunang urgent dating lama tunang about two years tapi ended they didn't managed to go throug
wah that means either like they are not ready financially atau just dah tak ada feeling lagi lah which saya macam pelik eh like you tahan for so long as in not say tahan lah dating for so long and the bila tunang you just give up ah
ya lah a bit basically that the reason why she wanted to contribute a story is because dia nak minta pendapat eh
correct but then entah lah I feel like but then to me kan kalau going back to my friend eh um together for seven year
and then tunang for two years and then you break it off to me is that ya you say got dugaan when they tunang tapi I feel that i
you are together for seven years you should go the partner already quite well so apa beza ya when you sarung cincin then oh suddenly all the problems come up you kno
so macam that's what makes it stagnant it's not the fact that oh okay ah lepas ni uh nak fikirkan tinggal mana uh nak duduk mana but it's the fact that oh it'll also that plan you can do i
okay that's the thing that I can already tapi kan the downside right okay with going back to like just one location or just one combined wedding eh is lik
the lauk is not as much as the one at orchard you know it's lik
err if I can remember right the company is only offering five type of lauk</malay
uh the other one is like the basic lah got the rice chicken everything even got like fish and then the like kuih muih ah it's also very limited like some a lot of places are offering ten types righ
he close bridal tahu then I ask the person if let's say I don't want bridal can I change to something else oh ya we can offer you th
kambing golek for about I think uh fifty people or the we'll issue uh like one thousand satay stick
uh as in uh part of the bridal right that means is uh tak salah it's two outfi
two outfit and then with mak andam everything he compared with the price of kambing and satay
who would wanted seh and he still want to charge over thirty dollars per person tahu and they even dare to say you know err because you know lah perangai kita after every wedding mesti will lik
this one tahu they say that you know if let's say there's another event right after your event lah we will have to clear ou
before before the end of the event so for example if your wedding macam pukul dua belas hingga pukul lima and if there is somebody who actually book that event spac
maybe pukul enam ya you have to start clearing by four which to me is not fair I like the one at orchard right the one they really said to me oh
so you want to stay as long as you want tak kisah do you know padahal both of them ar
kirakan muslim company you know malay muslim malay companies lah basically so macam it's not fair you know the way that they trea
who doubt service for the other company is much better tapi the
eh so dah okay eh
tak lah nama nama samaran ke apa tak tahu
masih oh okay okay boleh boleh okay good

err habis tu perempuan ni okay this girl like like interested in you tapi dia pun nak pergi high class how will you react
okay what if like macam perempuan ni macam okay lah she she nice tu semua macam dia dia cantik cute apa tu semua okay you like her tu semua
dia punya attitude just
how would you react ataupun dia macam dia dia dia kaki kikis dia macam mesti macam everytime
everytime dia dia cakap macam nak keluar kan mesti kena pergi high class punya tu serious ah
tak what what what if like tak dia punya personality semua bagus okay dia punya attitude but ah baik bukan sucks attitude dia bagus tu semua and all that then dia macam
is like a dream girl macam you know she got everything itu semua
tapi kan
macam she just want to go out with you macam high class restaurant tu semua lepas tu bila kau orang keluar kan tak boleh kena hujan tak boleh kena panas

macam like a few months later then like tengok ah your your chemistry with this person lepas tu try to macam go out with dia tu semua
tapi jangan jangan cakap lagi yang you interested in her so macam if you guys macam rasa macam there's a chemistry between you guys there's like something going on with you guys right
ya lah I mean like I mean okay because you already told her that you are interested in her then she said she's not interested in you what betul tak so so you already accepted accepted that then that's macam for you for you now you think that she treat you as a friend jer so in order to proceed to the next level tanya dia what do you what she see
macam itu because some girls are like just just not interested lah gitu
tapi kalau dia macam fickle minded macam one moment the she she treat you as a err more than friend macam you know macam
more than friend ah macam gitu
cakap no lah we are just friend apa tu semua
yes tu pun fifty fifty ah

baik baik how are you
ya my husband want me to jaga anak-anak and don't want me to work wah so good right my husband
oh wah like that leceh lah
then masak for my husband and kids then ya I feel safer for that lah
aiya tanggungjawab mah tak apa lah boleh
eh batuk-batuk pula
five days is so long imagine you sakit then after that you kena five days
eh tapi
you pernah kena sakit ke
tak ada special queue ke untuk kita
ah tengok lah bila my husband on leave cause ke sebab sekarang kan december holiday kan
ya that's true so sebab tu lah then government baru kasih seratus dolar untuk kita jalan-jalan
oh go lah I see like ada staycation then um holiday then I saw my friend kat facebook lah dia tulis dia cakap dia
for kids one they they get this hundred dollars ke you see lah I haven't got the chance to redeem it
ya lor tapi complain cakap yang ini mahal lah
because staycation is known to everyone that memang mahal but I think
government dah kasih duit tu is good enough
hais susah lah I'm waiting for the COVID to go off so I can
malaysia sepatutnya kasih singaporean masuk I think january but I think sebab case dia orang tiba-tiba naik I don't think it will come that fast lah
the I think the quality got a bit better tapi the inside you can actually put the filter
then the dia punya outer layer yang kena mulut tu is actually very silky so I tak sure lah benda tu really works because ended up my friend felt that it's uncomfortable especially under the hot sun
ya tapi surgical mask need to buy every single time and need to change everyday
oh yang apa tu makan dekat seoul garden ke apa tu eh
oh my that one to bring like what the whole family macam reunion dinner
ya lah but tapi orang-orang ni pun kena lah jaga apa um the
jaga dia apa tu nama dia tengok lah asyik lupa jer apa nak cakap
um jaga
whatever the government say kena ikut but the problem is I think kita pun kena faham orang-orang ni semua dah dah terlalu lama dekat rumah
and then they think it's a good time to actually meet their friends and family and until now phase number three pun masih belum ada apa-apa so I really don't know when phase number three is coming up
ya talking about parents kan my parent is quite old already so during period I tell you I didn't allow her to go out lah sebab
tapi the weird thing is everywhere is still crowded
mm lagi kat got orchard then now what dia orang punya christmas period I think tak ada lah mesti orang-orang ni mesti still have to go to orchard to to buy all these stuff
you know banyak malaysian kerja kat sini kan
they don't have any place to sleep over at uh singapore sekarang
ya lah that's true tapi at least dia orang come up with some um apa tu nama dia solution for the malaysian lah I heard that they give um
oh eh you think ah the people who come to singapore yang malaysia yang
dia orang nak hantar barang you know like those barang-barang kita mostly datang dari malaysia pe
like the sayur like all those foods lah you think they have to go swab test every single time or valid for a few weeks or days
mm eh you remember or not yang masa the first time yang COVID nineteen ni um keluar at news then they were asking for people to be yang swabbers
eh you have any friends working for that or not sebab dia orang tak train kan
wah but I think most of these people yang
jadi swabbers ni maybe dia orang kehilangan kerja kan
then apa dia wear those um protective gear
wah leceh juga eh but I really pity those yang
kena berhenti kerja then they have like what two three anak to feed you see then some of the wife is also like what um home
hmm I think also um government is trying their best to curb this issue just that you know lah some of us ni degil tak nak dengar cakap dia orang
but I feel we should be listening to them at this point of time sebab
like losing their mask so sepuluh kali bagi sepuluh kali hilang
that's why because I feel safer using the surgical mask actually for the kids tapi of course it's a added cost lah imagine sekarang berapa fifteen to eighteen dollars per box
kalau kita dapat murah tak apa juga ni mahal tau
macam mana tu very expensive to have a surgical mask
eh so you don't have plans ah for the december tak ambil leave ke maybe plan outing with your family ke
sebab iya lah special day kan mesti nak duduk luar apa jalan-jalan makan
but tu lah COVID lah restricted
betul lah for me pula tak tanya tapi masih nak bilang kan so for me my family kita nak pergi staycation
kesian budak-budak kan dia orang
okay selalunya saya buat kuih-muih melayu um then birthday cake then kalau saya time
bulan puasa tu saya sempat lah buat kuih raya untuk orang yang order tapi saya buat untuk small scale jer lah kan sebab government pun cuma kasih kita buat untuk family friends only
kalau masak usually I will just cook uh whatever I have in the fridge so sometimes I make like mi bandung um nasi lemak you know those normal stuff sampai tak tahu nak masak apa
betul juga um before this I realised that after the
tapi saya rasa kalau macam gitu deprive others lah untuk beli makan tambahan then you imagine if let's say gaji belum ada tak teruk orang yang diberhentikan kerja semua tak tak cukup untuk beli keperluan yang sepatutnya
ya tapi mana lah orang ni nak ikut undang-undang so maybe what they can what I heard was they go to one and then they go to another in around the same vicinity so I think people are quite smart but at the end of the day you are depriving the rest lah
ah ni cakap pasal masjid ni saya dah lama tak pergi madrasah di masjid
semua sekarang online
doing the delivery like grab apa lagi eh deliveroo I mean it's a decent job but
so I think people with uh young kids sepatutnya maybe could just do something else lah
eh kita ni asyik cakap pasal government aje dah lah kita cakap pasal makanan pula lah mm I'm hungry already do you want to eat
uh eh I saw like they have uh kentang
with kentang then yourself is
but by having this kind of high tech technology eh you see for older generation yang betul-betul tak tahu pakai app they have to go a longer way to to even buy food which is a necessity
cause you imagine orang-orang tua lagi they wanted fresh air they just want to go out you know but of course at this time especially the period dia orang tak boleh keluar tak boleh you know do the normal stuff like even going down
keluar to be free ya that's true so at least not restricted but now with COVID I think
of course government doesn't encourage lah not say that they cannot go out but their immune system is not strong like us lah orang-orang muda macam kita
at this point you how do I say eh macam
mm betul
mm betul tu
tapi saya rasa kalau um mereka diberi peluang untuk belajar
then expose diri dia orang dengan benda-benda macam gini mungkin inshallah dia orang boleh buat
mm betul tu
mm tak apa lah awak pun mungkin mereka akan cuba beli handphone yang
mungkin boleh guna handphone yang senang untuk pakai macam sekarang ada handphone ace samsung ace saya rasa itu senang untuk warga emas menggunakannya lah
tapi saya rasa pun di rumah orang tua not much of um they don't have internet access so that's why nak kena beli line which is also an added cost
sebab mereka tak use internet ah data as much as us kan kalau kita facebook instagram baca news uh semua lah
tapi masalahnya saya tak rasa macam awak cakap tak ramai lah yang mempelajari barang-barang baru seperti ini
mm mungkin
ya tapi saya rasa mungkin lama lagi kot
dengan malaysia begitu indonesia dan ingat tak hong-kong baru-baru ni dia orang nak buka hong-kong balik tapi tak jadi sebab ada about other infection case
ya oh cakap pasal ni saya teringat tentang
saya rasa dia orang pun tak ada bazar lah
sedih kan
tapi saya rasa kalau bila dah fasa ketiga dia orang in naikkan number of people to lapan
saya tidak tahu macam mana sebab saya rasa penat juga duduk di singapore sahaja
mm keluar especially bangkok kan
tak apa lah saya rasa saya nak buat staycation nanti
betul juga tapi tu lah staycation in singapore very expensive but it's okay end of the year
tidak risau dan also um
tu macam safe safe apa tu saya tak nampak lah
oh dah macam police ya mereka
wah dia orang dah pusing sini berapa kali
mm apa tugasan mereka yang patut mereka buat kerana saya rasa
tak ada benda yang mereka harus report then
a bit of waste manpower pula
ah oh ya baru saya ingat yang masa period tu
ada berapa video yang keluar pasal auntie uncle kat luar
mm then ada yang tak nak pakai mask susah lah nak nasihatkan orang
okay lah cuma kesian kat orang berbaju merah ni apa nama dia lagi
tapi yang um rasanya ada baju mereka tu ada yang letak mungkin
saya okay jer ah tengok tu dia tengah bebual dengan pakcik tu
pakcik tu tak pakai mask lah
sekejap ya saya check dalam app
this is my baju sekolah ah
esok no lah I just do whatever I have to do
kerja lah but no need to go out what
apa ah
mm the kucing can look after themselves
okay okay start balik ah
trick dia orang punya mind
kurang ajar sia then if I go to that shop then I read their mind oh this one
with just a click a a flip apa
with petik jari ah
ya lah petik jari
isn't isn't snap finger petik jari no meh
eh abeh kalau
tapi kalau smelly as fuck bau macam tong sampah you can be near that person meh you can see from far only what what's the point then
I thought that's why you're regretting it then you benci
if ada I want ah
yang for the cat ones ah
play with the cats yang sakit-sakit punya then I feel so bad for them now I want to bring them home sia
dah lah nak ambil kucing punya lah susah
but tu ada dua
no unless dia name it socks
in case they will attempt to jump on me again sakit tau tak
then when I open my eyes at least I can see one shadow dekat atas
ya I know lah but tu sebab
anak dia kena bunuh ah
then treat it like the three cats eh three cats pula the three cans you donate to the
but semalam you tried tried to feed them the chicken
or or you try not to mix nanti pukul empat
they will obviously not eat the chicken mousse apa
cuma they cerewet only but they still eat it
you change buttercup's foods sebab dia punya tahi apa
uh atuk dia punya birthday what
alah biar lah dia orang nak mate ke nak apa
jadi got more cute kittens
apa sia merepek ah
out of your embrace eh blossom sini lah
apa sia
apa sia
eh mana buttercup
if you have to jampi orang for one reason what would it be
itu last resort
no like ya jampi maybe that person
but you cannot lawan them what
so you jampi them and get back
I will only jampi
kan nenek cakap yang
yang our dad's side use all these also
mana tau dia punya
requirement is like kena male female male female I don't know they have weird
no why why like that weekdays lima hari sia weekend dua hari jer
tanya jer tak boleh ke
of course these are all syirik but
then semua kena kacau
ya like kena tarik kaki then like
mak kau terkejut aku I also don't know sia
then they ask me eh kau pakai barang eh then I was like
pakai barang apa sia
high likely kau yang patut kena kacau asal kita orang pula yang kena
kau tak kena langsung and the thing is while while we were there there's like um
then the rest was just standing around then dia dekat atas like
over over me and my friend so I was like they said itu
tu benda kau punya then I was like
we went satu dua tiga empat uh five of us right
then then they saw ah they saw kakak they saw itu they saw ini
that his mum lah kan nenek bising cakap apa
keep on suruh-suruh
apa sia ni like eh if I got a husband
like keep on asking me to buat tu buat ni buat tu buat ni and he's just sitting there and smoking like I will fucking slap his face with a broom sia and I ask for a divorce
should we go to ustaz and ask
not really salah bawa lah
tu ustaz tu pula nanti kita jadi isteri nombor sembilan dengan sepuluh tak nak ah
sial ah tak nak ah
pandai-pandai tinggi nak mampus uh uh
uh ah yes ah why would I be sad I was just sad for a moment cause like eh asal aku nak pergi jadi nombor sebelas eh
sekali the wife jealous of my beauty
then then ni number eleven ni tak boleh kasi poison ke apa
nanti kasi mee rebus
eh bini
ah that's where my question just now come if you have only one jampi what would you do mana tau the wife like that hmm
eh your pelindung also cannot lindung pergi mati
tak baik sia imagine if your husband is outside the door and he heard you
see your pelindung cannot do anything
berapa ah
no but it's so weird that since we don't know our cousins on papa punya side
you never know I'll be like a lipas you know like can't kill me
no china people bela me man
boleh chicken
I have then then if they see eh tak lawa sia nak kena pakai more makeup mm I I I really like
that's why I say greatest masterpiece that's why nanti clinic dia naik nama tau
then nanti people start sending barang lagi sebab dah lawa
then they send like endorsement hantar barang apa tu tak ke
places to grab maybe what apa
you want to know from where east spring secondary school previously now mana
cause if your underwear is ketat right so it's
hais makan one meal per day pun tetap tetap ada the
the babat
wah I keep on going up and down the stairs my kaki sakit sia
tu ah
telur with kicap
ee ee uh uh sia briyani makan dengan kicap rasa apa ah
should I try and see how it taste like I ate the briyani with belacan just now not bad
but the but the belacan overpowers the briyani taste
cakap apa sia kucing ini
like fries with sambal belacan with kicap
no like as in the sambal belacan and kicap is the sauce
apa then the the other two was like oh can we have more water then after I serve water then they say oh this
and apa ah dia cakap that mat salleh was saying like oh it wakes up the japanese man
then I was like mm part mana sambal dengan japanese eh
it's good you know like the nanny suara dia macam janice yang from friends
that voice dia buat-buat jer
when I read books they say oh her aura change then I was like macam mana sia aura boleh tukar then
nasal yang hidung punya voice
hais I need to eh ada surgery tak untuk buat lebih tinggi
then six months is it or one year yang tak boleh jalan
tangga I know I know
got a few people will say like you know I feel like I want to squeeze you then put inside my pocket I was like apa sia aku kecil gila apa sia dia orang nak buat gini
pakai heels pun like
we were googling on uh how to grow taller then ada they got sell some pills and stuff but then they say
lajukan your hormones or something like that
okay uh ya dia bukan friday sebab friday shafie dia kena
pergi sekolah so dia kata
uh kalau dia dah penat
dia tak enjoy so he wants
dia tak ada eh ada
tapi shafie nak involve
ya lah memang si june
tak payah mark sebab dia tak ada
oh over there got itu apa Marybrown
affaf punya bukan dua lagi tu
si affaf boleh lah because her
uh the other two they don't need to go pun
knowing si apa knowing si
dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak ogi
kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh if we go out I keep saying to the kids
it's just nice eight eight person the children saja
I mean if you don't want to leceh then just do it at home lah kat rumah kak ogi
one you contact kak ogi
then what what she say lah then after that baru
cause I think for us kita yang tak jumpa aisyah dengan
si kecil tu at least kak ogi jumpa juga lah once and then ayah tu jumpa kan
bila raya lah
think raya haji tak salah
eh buat juga lah
macam okay so it depends
uh because sekarang ni yang paling ramai is either mahir or amin
kan kat rumah yang paling ramai so we either go to mahir's house or amin's house
kalau si lina dia happy kat rumah amin ah because it's more apa orang tu tak ada kucing
tak so ertinya we cannot come one time pun it's just macam contoh lah eh
so kita bawa mak dengan si matin
pergi rumah amin so kita lapan orang lah kita jumpa amin dengan budak-budak tu kan
ah then second group could be andir dengan si mahir
bawa the children ah
ah eh eh tapi andir dengan si mahir dah tak boleh eh
tak boleh eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why kalau nak jumpa kena macam
so contoh contoh eh
then uh maybe mahir send his kids but dah berapa
seven plus uh si kecil tu akil akif
anak amin kat rumah dia so already join in lah
ah adoi ya lah but if nak have a cousin gathering then can
get together before ini I think maybe okay lah tapi kalau let say it is um
so uh apa all the cousins meet one time
then okay balik
tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu okay kalau macam gitu
anak-anak saudara jer
so they can't sit together pun I mean they won't sit together pun
correct kalau dekat rumah amin ada lah dia orang bermain
so to me biar anak-anak saudara ni semua all the children can come down at one time
mm asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit
kita biar budak-budak semua pergi amin you handle the kids
kita uh adults alright bye bye kita go for our
so and then andir selalu kan tu
so it's not like ini lah it's the together ramai-ramai yang tak ada
so one of my suggestion is that lah uh let the kids all kumpul kat rumah si amin so at least the kids
once you step out the house tak boleh
okay other than that then they all meet at tu their ayah teh house
ayah teh will be very happy all come come come
abang is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
how and what else can we do with mama
then we ajak mak
that weekend ah the christmas weekend twenty six ke twenty seven
so if let's say you want to pergi pun boleh pakai wheelchair kat situ
jewel kan dia ada all those uh tours right
ada waterfall lah
the the apa the atas tu ada the the apa
tak ada lah dia ada cakap apa semalam wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
dia ada dia punya own timing
not today is tomorrow kakak dia ajak tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want memang he already say he uh a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
ya that's why that's why I say so lepas ni she have to go to apa ni
because I cakap dengan dia
that lecturer yang quite good lah she talk to him quite a bit
if you he teach at these two uni dua-dua uni dia ajar
murdoch ah dengan northumbria so dia ajar
so dia kata memang kat northumbria
whereas dekat murdoch
you dah buat all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
err coursework lah another apa testing test
no she already memang in this line
dia dah memang buat communication so she can
officers came into the class and dah explain pun everything tapi uh
even that wira guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go lah
uh adult already cuma I don't know in terms of
and then now they tell us dah tak ada uh two time
all ah all of the ni ya
ya lah so for example the other time dia pergi M
tu actually not bad and I saw the programme pun macam bagus tau dia ada sound recording space
mana kawan dia atau overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up lah and say okay go maybe australia ke mana
practise apa maksudnya
that's why okay another option is tengok dekat malaysia
because malaysia pun banyak twinning programme
and twinning programme dia pun not bad quite good
anak ustaz ah
ah so actually we just limit it to singapore cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil kaplan
so with that diploma kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain
one more year tapi it's just one more year ya lah
tapi ya lah dia at the end of the day apa
budak ni nak buat shafie mati-mati nak buat photography right he wants to be a photographer
shafie dia once he is focused on
so that part is good lah he kalau betul-betul interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
bukan yang dia she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like huh apa kejadah ni so she apply K
uh anak tiga ke apa tak tahu she is she used to teach in preschool
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can macam
ya lah I mean that is not the whole idea pun the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so kalau let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources pun
you you go and pause ke apa
no lah tak you tekan the other side oh my god oh my god okay
oh he he message he say kak I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
but if if if cannot get the numbers itu yang ini kan
session tu yang I told ira ira kalau let's say parents datang they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session ah I cakap
because you can still do the assessment on the first day dia datang tu you can do
tapi kalau let's say dia
so dia accept dia P three still have to give the
if ya so on the first day dia datang
dia buat the assessment dulu that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so ira angguk-angguk don't whether she faham ke she agree ke will do ke tak tahu
I cakap dengan dia print the progress report do the apa
so that tomorrow we print out semua all one time lah so that's why I want to know what is it
I don't know eh to me macam it's okay lah you just print out pun okay black and white apa
don't have to turun you have to pass to the children
uh final apa the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi on in june
uh Kumon pun cakap the same thing
so he the new centre yang dia nak run uh a franchise tu
okay so he has been teaching when he was in um school dulu dia mengajar
uh part time part time lah macam uh he take up one or two uh students that kind of thing
ah banking dia banking so he was already working in
so kena lay-off
okay dia dia
but he has always been doing tuition macam his part time lah and all
orang serani so he he used that word you know he say saya orang serani he say like that I was like ah
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can macam
entah eh no nama dia chen kang eh
tu lah I have to ask the children how to sebut nama dia so is ya
see the it uh the indian lady pun okay
then kita ada two more options lah ya
and then we can also work on apa kata orang tu
nisa kan dia cakap dia cuma nak ambil kalau suami dia punya cuti falls on ni
okay lah tadi a'ah satu hari
buat kerja the assignment and all the
tapi err
ya but most probably I taking half day off lah half day off ke ataupun
ataupun time off lah but most probably I'll take a half day off lah
the company err wants me to clear lah especially pakai lah he
ya lah cause at the update especially besok besok kan ah thirtieth
ya you can you can you can masak first lah kalau boleh
ya don't don't buy two or three ikan at one shot and then after that keep for few days
and err the thing will spoil if you tak masak see like the broccoli that you buy also
I mean wasted kan kalau kau tak masak it'll just go to waste
okay lah okay juga
tak tak sangat ah I think maybe or maybe not lah
lepas tu ya lah

bagus lah K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
oh eh apa bara api tu scary juga tu nanti kalau like if one of you all like marah habis sia dua-dua volcano seh
so like your chinese one your you you're what ah tiger right ya tiger memang ah
macam a'ah bara api gitu tiger fierce
tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa so baru tiga bulan so you don't know lah like
cause for me and my husband kalau kita kita dah jumpa everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months kita macam dah tahu each other gitu ah so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
fight that okay I did something wrong then kita orang cakap ah kita mesti cakap ah like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys dia sekarang sekolah right so he berapa tahun lagi eh
oh he's just a normal lah bukan honours lah
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years gitu
mm four years so dia macam
okay dia start dia belajar apa
gitu-gitu ah
oh first year already tak surviving oh rabak hancur seh
exam exam ah okay so dia sekarang end of the first year
if he pergi counselling the course counselling he might have to restart lah
three four more years with something you don't like kan lagi exams means you have to study for it
tu ah and he's still so young he's like what twenty five kan so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter ah ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then lagi rabak then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
I think macam dia kena fikir betul-betul lah kalau dia kalau dia nak continue ke atau dia nak
like tukar ke because like one year is still okay tapi bila dah two years gitu kan then I think that's when it's err there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay lah kalau nak tukar right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like kalau in in so actually kalau some people right they will uh come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first sebab lagi senang but you waste one year lah but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
uh uh so like macam gitu pun boleh lah kalau if you want because a lot of people kat poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like err some course that they don't like like engineering gitu then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma yang dorang nak and then after dorang masuk then they get to go ah so it for them is like um ya you you sacrifice one year ah to do what you want then so you can think of it like that gitu
okay so dia dah tapi dia electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff asal dia tak pergi digipen
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then kalau tak boleh you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best lah
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for ada tau art design on media that one at least ah there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
ya so like macam my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that one that time [kan] she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want lah so eh I mean I feel like
um I'm okay tapi I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so macam I felt like I needed to work or at least do something ah like not school for once gitu
ya pretty much even though like kat uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff tapi then I went back so ya then I think
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right um what I heard from my classmates ah yang dah dorang bekerja kan then dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun ah at the most sepuluh tahun gitu then dorang come back to like get just get a degree dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis like an essay like how to write essay all that dorang dah lupa
ya so um that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it gitu
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words apa
berapa tahun eh berapa tahun
oh satu eh
so kalau you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
lepas kahwin betul-betul nak kahwin dulu eh
oh is there a reason why you want to like kahwin first
um in terms of stress kan lepas kahwin eh you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I kahwin and then lepas tu like I felt very
um stressed out sebab like nak our our mum she ah she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and ayah decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking gitu so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
tapi takde apa-apa ah because ah kalau orang tanya pun I will just say oh my husband he's okay with apa so in the end religiously uh culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think ah so
kau siapa seh
so my suami is super like easy going dia faham everything I'm very honest to him
kalau I'm going to this place ke apa I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him lah I'm going to overnight kat tempat ni with my friends we just wanna chill kalau nak ikut ikut ah like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so kalau dia nak keluar ke apa with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding lah so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
kahwin ya
ya betul lah
tu ah
then macam I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
malangnya I think you want like my kind of wedding
ulam seh kampung kat mana ni kampung apa malaysia
pulau ubin dorang nak tutup apa
semakau pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi
kalau nak pergi kat malaysia kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana
ah tak rapat ah tapi ada lah ada tu ada lah
filter kau block yourself you block yourself you know
kau block sendiri but then the rental will be insane
ah betul lah uh then mm pulau ubin is actually quite interesting for a wedding
like like are they chinese ke malay ke oh
takde motor takde kereta ah bagus kau
dia jemput jer semua orang tapi actually tak jemput semua orang indirectly lah
orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat west kat east east so dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang uh yang uh um uh kat tuas situ kat johor masuk masuk ah johor masuk tapi kalau kau orang uh tampines pasir ris tak payah datang sudah waste your time
so dorang kat sana kat mana dorang the majlis kat mana
is like you only go there kalau nak show off
kan like if you just want to show off cakap like you like you got a lot of money then okay lah sentosa lah but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore yang you can actually get
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money gitu
uh tapi ada timer ah dah reach dah reach harbourfront okay habis wedding habis
uh uh uh unless if unless if like you ah ambil the cruise ship yang pergi batam and back ah then okay got time tapi ada cruise yang sekarang they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back lah so kalau macam gitu susah sikit ah
and orang tak boleh datang like wherever they want they have to come bila bila cruise dia dah nak ship off gitu ah
a'ah ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil lah sampan kau bawa sampan kau kelakar seh nanti dorang dayung sampan
alamak susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah
I think at night lah we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then bila dah malam kan then we say oh uh all the makcik pergi tidur and stuff and then terus we got to the club and then terus
so you went with adik
buffet jer buffet lah buffet dia halal lah
oh chilli crab pun ada
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones yang macam the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go ah even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like um
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like eh is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so rabak so I didn't even K I didn't even like
uh uh but okay lah it was fun lah it was for once you get to feel like macam orang kaya gitu uh tapi like ya that's it lah but I don't know lah like
kalau korang nak um pergi staycation ke tak
I know the kalau if the d'kranji here is
clean certified clean certified then maybe kita boleh pergi sana
cause there is like very secluded kan so it's a different experience gitu like out of city life
uh tapi I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
uh you and me will have this share the room and then he and abang hafiz will share lah
uh so kita halalkan lah
oh so susah tu but no if they like
uh uh a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause kalau if it's two hafizes I mean both tak boleh seh
uh uh so I think macam okay lah like we we can do that but it depends ah like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away tu ah
mm january gitu okay
ya lah but I mean okay lah we can we can always go tapi the thing is like you said ah must plan lah ya
oh ya the one you told me yang dia
I mean dorang pun macam orang melayu lah you have to understand lah kita orang pun macam everything also macam relax apa
tak ikut sangat ah but
ya so I feel like macam
macam gitu it will be really susah for them to
and indonesia pun teruk teruk seh
like indonesia is teruk
kalau tengok dia punya cases
ah betul
indonesia is also like quite high death rate kan death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else gitu
so this is very scary ah like lagi dorang pun I don't think they care then they are so dense gitu the the country
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures kan err then err but for them dorang tak ada pun I mean kita bila we needed the extra space terus kita pergi tukar expo lah tukar all the places that we already have tapi tak pakai apa because COVID kan so we use that place to um immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
tapi kalau indonesia I think susah because kan singapore kan kita kan asyik kiasu kan kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau indonesia semua relax
dorang relax jer kita kan kiasu everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
mm uh dorang pun macam kalau mati mati lah dah sakit that's their thinking ah dah sakit apa sakit so kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi
so dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu ah dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh uh manage kan all these things ah so it's very hard for them ah like india also is very very very bad
ya ya ya yang teruknya kan a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour ah saying that it's
a'ah but like I feel like it's somewhat true because dorang really tak kesah for the for the old people
ah then like dorang macam they will only like take in like patients yang have a chance of survival
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like dulu punya america
ya during um last time when america was quite bad kan I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so macam kesian ah but in india it's like that every day now
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more tapi they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang uh yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan like
don't mess lah don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that tu kan
ya tapi orang-orang tua dorang kan uh tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal lah kan kita orang dah cakap pakai mask and jangan uh jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang kan kalau nak keluar keluar lah apa nak jadi
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so macam um there was this atuk not atuk ah pek in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like oh no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
like we will just like huh like what what are we supposed to do you know ah but like kita tak boleh buat apa-apa cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
orang tak suka pakai mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
ah pek together kadang-kadang more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk macam biasa lah macam tak ada COVID gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang just biarkan jer ah
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do lah dia dah dia dah like bored lah I think
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there dorang tak tengok pun tau kalau kalau kau scan ke kau tak scan ke dorang just masuk dia kasi masuk jer dorang tak kesah kan ya so it's like it's so like uh jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay lah singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not ah I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
um but because everyone has to wear mask so tak tak boleh buat apa-apa so it's that's why tak ada macam transmission not so much of transmission ah ya
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that kan so err it's it's like already in our we already know you know like um the social way to like macam social responsibility lah ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause dah berapa lama seh dah berapa bulan going to one year I feel
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here sebab kan kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain is like wow betul-betul rabak like but kat singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker punya time that time bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus seh ya
with soap like dulu kan siapa nak cuci tangan dengan soap I ask you like tak ada seh all the aunty ah wash hand only wash water can already lah dorang memang mesti tak pakai soap punya mana ada pakai soap seh
now now they don't now they're like ah ya kalau tak wash nanti eh you never wash you never like use the soap ah then lepas tu baru dorang
you you really pakai the soap ya
good things comes of it uh come out from it lah ya ya ya betul lah like I think it's um inevitable lah like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
so the toilets are generally cleaner ah so like okay ah it's not bad ah um mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown kan and know france kan dah second lockdown
ya rather than macam kat sweden where it's like free and easy and then wow the death rates are like crazy seh
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad kat japan lah so dorang kena mula balik ah everything lah have to go back the mask and all that err I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff lah ya I think everywhere is still quite bad eh but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden kan kesian seh
tapi for me I kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat seoul garden sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu ah tu ah macam kesian seh ah nasib baik dia pergi doctor
ah naisb baik dia pergi doctor then lepas tu you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya ah tu ah so
I mean I think kesian ah macam he got more hate than
what he should have gotten gitu ya
no dorang three tables uh
so there were still like macam bergroup tapi err it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around lah macam kadang-kadang dorang mix like you sit here I sit there ke apa mix food err so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the um the fear that they have lah
ya so kesian ah
and dia dia sakit kan dia pergi doctor then bila dah kena COVID and the check up oh at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed lah the rules and stuff kat sini seoul garden ah if me I think I wouldn't say so much seh I diam diam jer tak lah but like I feel like macam why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already kan ya so I feel like um he's actually good part ah for him to be really responsible also
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended err people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like apa seh
like what the hell does that even mean gitu uh uh so I I was like wow this prime minister really wants to like err reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
uh uh I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you makan then I'm like but it's so like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so err ya macam gitu like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it ah bagus ah dorang habis ah a'ah tu ah like macam it's
ya ya ya he's just like ah give up lah dah mengaku kalah
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to macam err cheer up the community gitu um it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time lah
then macam ah nak masuk sekolah pun senang /malay
oh in Australia belajar macam basics like Mathematics English
err habis tu I also belajar macam
oo my most favorite ah is definitely um belajar apa ni Law because it's very interesting lah like I get to learn about you know Australian law and it's uh it's a it's a subject that you know you don't learn
dalam err Singapore punya education I mean secondary school punya subject
ya I feel I feel you macam susah nak nak part dengan family kan
eh uh the dalam sekolah you do you do macam any
ya floorball is fun I last time before I pindah to Australia I was also in a floorball team
tak fair
hopefully lah maybe you can try next year you know never know your kau punya chance kan
huh biar betul
wah I've never heard before eh I thought you only can join like you know your only your faculty punya apa tu punya wah I didn't know you can actually do that
oh um sekarang I tengah ambil apa ni interaction design so not a lot of people know about this course because like my school is like the only school yang ada this course
um basically kat dalam course ni I do macam coding dengan design it's a very
a pasal like
coding dengan design macam tak banyak orang tahu buat so
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now macam um banyak benda is like about technology kan so ya I feel like this course uh actually benefit me lah in the future
ideation so macam kita belajar macam mana nak uh brainstorm ideas uh for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so uh for you ah you said you were in like um marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules yang kau enjoy
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so susah tak macam kerja like in a like a team
then uh uh besides sekolah kan like what what do you like to do macam do you have macam other hobby ke or apa apa benda lah
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school pastu ada apa O level abeh stress takle fikir yeah
oh during my free time I suka
uh macam uh draw I also like to err tengok apa ni
ah anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because takde time kan poly dalam I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to uh do my hobbies which is kind of uh macam sedih but yeah so
actually ada banyak plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
but um I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then um maybe in uh um year two then I will start macam join like start trying out for ah I've actually picked
macam a few is err firstly is ah floorball like um aku kata tadi kan as I've mentioned uh floorball and then second was silat
and then third is dikir barat ya but
ya it is it is that's why macam I'm like a bit takut to um you know join their team because err macam dorang nya expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet dorang nya expectations
but I think right I think confirm boleh pass punya confirm
oh mesti sakit eh
then the the surgery bila
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then dia dia kata like
um it's actually not that painful lah because like you know they put you in uh on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you bangun so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think ah after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you tak nak any macam side effects kan so ya
how how how would you feel like macam you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like macam like your feeling
uh I've never I've never apa ni had any surgeries before
I can't imagine the macam dia nya sakit
tak lah I never say
ya ya ya so macam during my free time cause ah
apa ni I I love doing calligraphy right so I like macam I have I have like a mini business where
I uh buat calligraphy on orang punya macam notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like um quite a reasonable price lah so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
uh I like aiya basically like um doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to macam you know buat this business because
cause a lot of people kan you know singaporeans kan diorang suka macam study kan then banyak orang suka buat macam notebook diorang macam cantik cantik so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that diorang ada macam motivation to belajar
kan sekarang COVID kan so like uh kat dalam rumah what do you do
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also macam a good way lah for orang to you know macam get that extra cash
then like after after macam COVID kan
you where's where's the first place yang you want to travel
and remember yang kita semua jatuh sakit after we played at the beach
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit
yeah hopefully once like macam the border dah buka then we can go
after macam this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is uh mana ni Japan
I've been there bila when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so macam tak ingat uh I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna macam go there again and then macam like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also macam if it's like an interesting country ah macam menarik you know pasal
like because uh I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there macam collect diorang nya apa ni figurine because like banyak orang kata macam
is macam quite cheap ah so I was like okay ah then I I think if if cause I like to collect
the the work is macam due next week kan then I would only do it like macam tiga hari before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too macam penat nak buat buat the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
always use my I'm on my handphone asyik tengok Instagram semua then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like oh dah lambat ah just tidur lah besok boleh buat
macam like group projects eh
oh recently I I ada macam this one err group project like I just finished macam err dua weeks lepas is apa it's called studio project so it's basically like because uh
so my group kita buat we did this uh macam is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and macam the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very susah app
to pakai because ya it's only my first year and then is also my macam my first time ah pakai then it's like susah ah then like all my other friends macam they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story macam interesting ah so like when users uh see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like macam arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next uh page or something so that's like macam there's an interaction there
Animal Crossing is a very in game now eh a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious macam banyak orang like semua main ah then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
macam look forward to ah
wah that that's quite a handful you got you got banyak project to apa ni buat
yeah it's good also because like kan year three we ada internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for um untuk like the company before diorang accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like diorang we're just like straight away masukkan you inside there but I didn't know like you have to macam go through an interview so I think macam it's quite it's quite beneficial lah like apa diorang
ajar teach kat dalam yeah
I also had like a similar a similar module I did apa ni uh previously
where also same it's called uh effective effective err communication skill so diorang ajar macam mana
nak you know err if err communicate effectively and how to like you know gain uh confidence
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to macam macam you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting ah but macam sedih ah because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me ah from someone who is actually macam
macam takut to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who err is uh confident enough ah to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
and macam it's like quite cool lah because like then you can macam cari orang in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me err there's this macam ada this uh girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like eh I heard you're in the in the same course
then uh she's like uh let's be friends ah then from there uh we started being friends ah then err when during poly because err mostly it was on Zoom right because of macam this COVID situation semua so everything macam is online
ya so err ya then err in school like when we macam jumpa
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for macam many years
ya so it was like quite easy lah in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing macam susah is that uh is like the modules ah because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never macam done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done tak pernah buat coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like macam party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
oh I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything macam
macam the badge gitu so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift one ah so it's not bad ah tapi panas gila
and the and the worst thing kan towards the is tengah puasa you know tengah puasa then like me and my friend macam like eh nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak
then we then kita almost batal lah my then my friend dah tak boleh take it kan then she was like ah batal jer lah
eight hours was uh painful lah then kita jalan jalan
ya we we we we walked around the whole of Tampines ya but it was very very rewarding pasal uh at the end of the day kita dapat banyak donation
huh biar betul
kay lah not bad you know at least you all macam you know like put money inside lah donate also
but if you were to do macam flag day again would you do it
penat I couldn't macam buka my mata
ya it was during bulan puasa
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the macam the tempat yang ada shade kan already dah ada orang so me and my friend like macam terpaksa ah kita stand
under the hot sun then collect lor but that spot was the best cause banyak orang lalu sana so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like alamak shouldn't have told them
ya true hopefully lah I I I really wish macam this COVID situation will macam die down ah because it really affects ah kita punya life
a'ah so kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap like in both like melayu dengan english so boleh tak
okay maybe kita nak cakap pasal like kita punya favourite show boleh tak
oh movie apa
wait like buta like like how buta hati atau like you know
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like kenapa dia buta
tak senonoh then after that
wait tapi the guy know yang like like
the guy is dia apa tu yang punca yang the girl punya
lelaki tu wah
memang macam like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya lah but like macam it's so coincidental you know like macam the girl dengan the guy is like
kedai ya
but macam it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think kena tengok right
your abang is my adik
I think it's kind of takde lagi is it
pasal dia ya dia orang dah remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like perempuan you know like the girls and then like eh like macam like when I watch it I was like oh my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know uh macam baca buku all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then lepas tu like
then lepas tu he I think dia orang ada like sepuluh seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai like dia orang like tiga puluh lebih and until like
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you tengok like macam dia orang like grow to become like a better person
so macam damn cool because I also because like dulu kan macam banyak orang ingatkan like orang yang suka science semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil like very awkward right like they feel like they macam cannot fit into the society
socially less awkward and also because like macam if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
because like I remember one episode kan like macam young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy nama sheldon
school like not really a professor lah by research scientists and then lepas tu like um banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh fit in
but then over the years apa dia dia dia cuba like fit in to like parties macam because ada seorang perempuan popular ni neighbour dia
kan and then like um dia like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then lepas tu they will they will feeling very awkward because dia orang dia orang like cuba to interact with like the rest
ya dia orang semua ingatkan dia weird sebab like dia datang pun like dengan baju tak senonoh
until the party and cannot fit in lah but then lepas tu then he realise that oh my god
apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok show ni daripada kecil call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing lah because like dia dia dia pun like was single all the way then lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan ah kahwin then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then tak he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that um apa tu to like
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise betul tak like he cannot like
ya so they actually show us yang macam love
terus jump to it
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast kan dia orang carry macam opposite of each other
ya so dia orang cuddle cuddle dia macam like eh let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu then like
oh because you pakai like all the duit birthday for all this
I know you said you show me the photos mah and then macam it's damn nice what
no lah but waffle kan macam murah takkan they will charge you lah
okay but haji lane is overpriced sebab tu lah you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually murah ya but it's at where somerset
that means like macam kalau they are not like at the central area of singapore kan it's usually cheaper
ya lah that's why it's cheaper lah kalau if it if it's at town right confirm mahal
what no lah but tu untuk buka like cafe in singapore quite
so you become like ibu
design the place itself kan macam they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
it's not it's very mahal and like ya
it's like macam you know like we we it's like our like previous kedai lor
ya it's like you need to know makanan apa sedap and then like sometimes kan you hire the chef and the dia tak tahu masak
no but actually makanan tak sedap pun tak apa tau cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like macam it's cool lah like
you know like your makanan K cause your makanan tak sedap kan at least your coffee sedap or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
ya ya lah you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee macam tak ada gula
ya like takde gula is like totally fine with me ya
actually I want to ask you kan macam like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts um if you have like tiga like wish that you wanna wanna
ya like okay like kalau tak ada macam K if like there's no boundaries because you know like macam you tengok aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like oh I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like kan like duit apa tu apa tu it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar kan tak fun
cause like I feel like I'm macam sangat lost
there's too many like macam like direction that you can go like because you imagine kalau you stay in malaysia then like ya tak banyak ya like I think you will only get like
like kan siapa like most people will go either retail and then like or office world lah because in singapore we kita kita believe in like equality right
so that's why I like I like the so for me macam like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working kan like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
even though I know it pays well like gaji besar but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's penat and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay lah maybe you kalau you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start macam betul susah
ya bukan like the
ya cause you know like if you go jakarta like I don't know you wait did go batam ya you went batam before right and you know like macam some places are very crowded then you know they don't care one ya
they do though because that time I went national gallery then dia orang semua duduk dekat
ah dia orang semua loiter dekat you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then lepas tu the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then kena pekik sia they were like oi is you new like why
and then lepas tu the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend lah then I was like oh my god what's this maid doing ah
ya I tak kisah so I just like walk away and then lepas tu they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
tapi like
you are just lucky cause like in singapore macam even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
ya so we all ya I think singapore bagi kita like money to like spend for all these trips sia so I think it's like I think that's a good thing eh
dia sounds like internship kan then I was like wah
ya macam like people from korea guam that's why
macam like banyak orang that like
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business macam it's easy to
okay lah it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like macam I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
you should go with afal adik
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know macam tempat
tak bersih sangat lah also it's okay ya ya they don't care one
science kau ah
kak ya you know inshira right she's working like so called full time in nurse
who's kak epah
kak malinah that one is
ya oh tapi K takpe kita boleh masa baru
oh I see semua busy
ya but I used to be sociable but then I realize like eh okay because maybe I tak I think I know why cause you tak you've not enough money
bagi set aside budget berapa like berapa duit
wah lama sia
oh you nenek say that
mahal is it
like cheese I don't understand yes ibu also don't like but ibu okay with it you know why
I setuju oh you ramen
no ask kakak to help you lah
like selamat datang ke podcast saya
ya but I don't think macam like podcast kan ada
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why bapa all listening to podcast now
ya I know what you mean like macam but for me right if I clean I'll be happy
so one person talk then one person answer K okay so topic permulaan
okay I don't know what happen I was at home tengah keluar masuk bilik cari makanan as usual cari air then suddenly mama on the sofa scrolling her Facebook and then she say the kranji resort ni macam cantik let's all go stay for holiday gitu ah satu three day two night something like that
no she just ask like korang nak pergi farm stay tak I initially said no because it's at kranji and I always told her like nanti sana ada momok
I think so ya dia dekat dengan sungei buloh all the way sia I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday um I went to research more lah like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown abeh macam tak ada makanan and stuff like that ah
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue nya barang barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november kan the review was on sixteen november just two days before
huh sekarang hotel tengah macam staycation package gitu kan
baru keluar eh ah later I go check
I ask mama what about snow city because it's the nearest to our house and we have never been there before so might as well pergi sana mama kata tak pernah nampak snow that time she went to bugger she just saw like one to three ah sikit gitu jer
yes it was a son of a peach then lepas tu I share with mama then mama was like eh tu dekat dengan apa rumahnya mak punya rumah kan tu is it the new house is it
tu mama dah start dia punya
oh yang block one two eight eh
boleh lah dah terlanjur
wow was this like during the time of the makcik keropok yang datang rumah abeh orang semua macam
oh no makcik keropok was much later I think was in that time
makcik keropok has been going around for quite long ah I don't know when we moved to our house dekat clementi kan think I was in uni that time then there was this bibik indonesian who tengah jual keropok and then it was I think malam lah macam lapan lepas maghrib bibik tu ketuk pintu abeh tanya nak jual keropok
then mama tengah kat living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like adik adik then the bibik kasihan tau the bibik was like saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu
then I was like I alamak mak aku tak baik seh dia terus panic gabrah depan depan bibik tu but I ended up buying a few keropok lah cause kasihan
ee bacin
lepas renovation hopefully dah okay lah tapi nak kena hack balik ah takut pijat-pijat bau takpe bau will go away but it's the pijat that maybe can come back
kat dalam-dalam ah
like really people who really don't know how to take care of their things actually like time beli rumah time tengok-tengok rumah your parents didn't know they have twenty cats inside the room
mm agaknya eh
tengah renovation ke
alamak okay lah tak lah nanti kalau kita bebual nanti tak dengar sangat
I tried linkedin I tried um my careers future which is tak bagus tak guna punya
or like macam singtel you know government related jobs ya and then um the the the macam amount of jobs kat situ tak banyak sangat lah kat my career future so I tried also the other one which is job street lah job street has the most but job street is mostly recruit recruiters ah or even if they have job like macam they call me back dia punya job dekat east side dekat loyang because I do supply chain mah so a bit too far for me lah
tak ada the good thing is like macam I attended all these itu job fairs and all these job fairs err there will be someone who will call me back and ask me if um anything positive come out of the the the job fair macam ada interview ke tak then I will just let them know that ada ke tak which I will always say none I attended follow back with me follow up with me on any interviews or what then they said okay never mind will still continue to search for you
eh tak tahu I will try
okay lah sekarang job market macam gitu so I'm just waiting for twenty twenty one ah for things to be better
itu jer so sad
oh so now he's only the only one stuck there but his family dah balik sini lah
sana tak ada macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the changi punya restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
when the news came out she ask me adik do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama nak try makan first class tak pernah duduk alah tak boleh fly kan duduk kat dalam aeroplane dapat makan pun jadi lah gitu so I told mama for the price that you pay ah I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
I remember like I I did say that out um mama did say that she want me to macam take them go jalan-jalan lain kali daya bawa pula lah because like the last time she went japan macam korang bawa dia kan so she said to me lain kali daya bawa lah kita jalan-jalan so I told mama
cara I jalan-jalan later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
but penat seh masa tu kita pergi japan banyak jalan so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
sedap but the sedap is what the cook is malaysian cook ah or japanese cook
I never try nasi lemak on airplane before
things to note nak kena try nasi lemak kat silk air important question nak fly tu bila tu aiya I hope they can find a cure for this COVID seh
betul punya travel bubble eh from one island to another island
oh ya a'ah orang semua nak balik negeri
dah relax dah kan
oh dah thirty minutes already
a'ah still a lot of things juga
eh then they hack it out then outside is what kosong jer oh
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually macam reject reject punya kalau orang tak suka the areas ah the units ah
ah atas tong sampah gitu ah ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya fengshui tak bagus ke yang at least the good thing is tak ada momok ah kalau resale kan
yang tengah yang tengah have lah tengah have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also macam cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app tu kan so people who live in like edgefield plains kat kawasan sengkang they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya ah macam kau masuk terus dah siap
I want like macam cement floor macam gini kan macam cement floor
it look like macam cement gitu like concrete gitu
so I was thinking of something like this lah macam yang penting colour grey bawah tu look a bit like cement
korang ada skirting tak kita letak skirting juga lah
because I was thinking that kalau if I move out to my own place I think I need to bring pluto along with me I told about mama papa I don't want to live alone so I confirm nanti bawa pluto sekali lah so I also think about oh if you want to have a house nanti pluto need her own cat tree lah you need to catify the house semua kan
so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation abeh rumah dia macam minimalist gitu and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like macam have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
ye lah si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau jer now the kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek so that's why I'm thinking like that ah tak payah lah beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu simple simple then IKEA kan macam batau furniture then after five years can throw already
they katuk very fast eh
a lot of macam renovation company mcam dorang katuk very fast
oi kejapnya dah rosak
hood jatuh
oh ah reno talk bagus ya ya
I was actually looking at counter tops semalam cause I had berangan nak okay nak macam kayu punya butcher countertop pastu kan cement floor gini kan and then dia punya ah tempat cabinet dia colour putih gitu so I was thinking oh very nice colour putih macam a bit rustic sikit butcher block then sekali when I read about the butcher block is literally just a chopping board so nak kena letak mineral oil semua nak kena maintain tu yang leceh
oh macam boleh buat back splash terus gitu eh
wow tak pernah dengar ni vulcan
nak kena wax tak atau sealing ke apa
entah she tak mention apa she just said that ah nanti kalau singgah sheng siong bilang eh
betul but I'm not going to go sheng siong I'm going to go daiso but I don't know I think jcube got one daiso
padahal dekat but still uh need to walk further
choa chu kang nya dah siap
COVID happened kau nak kena bagi chance dekat dorang
but it's near to mama and papa so when I'm malas to cook I can just walk over
ah mama actually said that she say kau jangan pergi dekat tu sengkang jauh-jauh ni kau dekat-dekat jer dari lah dekat clementi resale pun tak apa
buruk-buruk one
ah then dah buat ni semua aiya tak payah pindah
ya lah tak payah pindah stay there for what at most also you just need to renovate the room that taufik has been using to keep his things did you see the canvas I saw a lot of like shoes they use the small rooms they change it to like a home office with like a see through glass it's very nice
true lah singapore susah nak cari yang perfect perfect
a'ah seh kasihan your neighbour only got one plant and then korang letak banyak-banyak
pokok hang dia satu jer tanam lah pokok-pokok hang banyak sikit
actually good lah the jiran that's okay tu pun susah nak dapat
oh dorang alternate kan
try teaching ah macam mana nak teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
oh okay okay okay faham faham
that's why I really macam tabik ah those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan parent layankan principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar
yang kat luar tu semua habis ah pecah-pecah
eh bijak eh dia bijak
tu lah kalau anak saudara sendiri okay tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds kalau anak saudara at least the values are still similar you know kalau budak tu ada problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
dah hafal script ah gitu
for me tuition was different okay like macam I know that the syllabus are ajar macam gini kan but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different macam not say education level like macam tahap kefahaman dorang is different so macam maybe in class the teacher already dah start on algebra but the kids punya foundation is still very weak so although dorang dah sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still macam at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting lah for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching ah ada budak macam they really need ah physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think macam is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all kan
they will be like apa tu one kenapa one kenapa one plus one kenapa tak boleh one and that kind of thing
actually it's not that hard I realise okay lah because for me um I teach budget tuition and I teach orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam more or less macam ah relax jer kau datang class kan dia kasi epok-epok lah dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
tu dorang punya um general generally lah most of them dorang punya mindset is like that there are a few macam one or two who come and they say like oh I want my kids to get A padahal the kid is already a B student so for me macam when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid dah interested in learning automatic terus dorang A sendiri so jadi tak stress macam gitu
yang stress is when you haven't start the parent macam ah kepoh kepoh lah like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid ah macam gitu tu leceh sikit
ajar budak-budak madrasah ah madrasah kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school punya how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some makcik like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because madrasah under private school kan
okay what al al-irsyad ah eh but al-irsyad susah nak masuk eh
sekolah tahfiz ah
eh but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from madrasah like oh my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
okay mah tak salah pe but I notice this trend tau macam my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education wah they really start planning the education route early on baby masih dalam perut dah planning tau nak hantar childcare ni lepas umur ni pergi this school nanti pastu hantar ni
macam we all orang biasa relax ah pergi sekolah good enough already ah
as an adult I wanted to be a farmer I apply kat kok fah kena reject seh sedih
no cannot so gatal
but like macam tak effective
okay nanti I go lah when I'm free
lepas kena reject satu kali macam sedih I feel so rejected but like I don't know I feel like I should work also right now

anyway chicken sandwich was so nice tapi lepas tu rasa macam unhealthy gila
sebab it was literally patty chicken and then put like dua tiga pickles begitu and then the patty again

he referred to the bugis people as pirates and then after that like the malaysian royals marah dengan dia

ya ah I already cari the kedai already I asked one of my friends there when I sampai like which one like which kedai this kedai bagus or not then he said oh ya ya this one dia ada kawan pergi something like that and then after that
baru nak book appointment already when I was there
habis my dad dia kata oh cause before that my dad got the kidney problems one then he didn't want to let me or my sisters donate our kidney
my dad dia ada kidney problems
ya so at that point of time dia tak bagi kita orang donate our kidney
I I I don't need to take care of my body what cause I got nothing to lose so I baru nak eh I baru nak err book appointment habis
the night bila I was about to book the appointment my dad messaged his kidney were like lebih teruk then after that he said like then I told him lah if you want the kidney I can give then he said okay can
habis bila balik I bilang kakak then I was like oh I I I almost got it then after that she marah ah mampus sia no ah
call me bodoh all then I was like correct ah bodoh but
her friend is like her age semua dah tua
ya they know lah like I balik pukul berapa
another time at the pukul empat pagi dia jumpa aku tengah muntah dalam toilet
cause she said dia kata pe ah
if your sister finds out she'll kill me so neither of us are gonna tell your sister cause I tengah muntah muntah dalam toilet dia muntah rabak
err unless kakak telah bayar then yeah
I don't know ah I I don't minum anymore not since I met amira
she call me kentang
wait then like she asked me ah macam dulu I buat apa then I told her like all those benda bodoh bodoh like like you know like people
like conventionally when people go clubbing and stuff right like they like fuck boys ah like later they cari perempuan or what
bila I pergi clubbing in with all my friends
all I did was just make a nuisance of myself like joget joget I panjat pokok
ya I panjat dua pokok satu lamp post
when I balik station
cause that that time was like a rohtak outing the entire rohtak you know because no then after that the next day shift I balik station
then I masuk the office jer then after that everybody was calling me eh peter parker peter parker then I was like huh apa sia
and then after that my friend told me like oh kau tak mabuk kau panjat pokok habis after that like the this lah she was the one yang like jaga me because she don't drink then they know like I'm a handful
so like she turned around like she couldn't find me then she turned around then she saw me climbing the pokok then she's like ah turun then I was like no go away I'm peter parker and after that I started climbing higher
ya then nasib baik sia but it's
so ya like I I satan satan tapi bodoh
not not like the not like the creepy satan but the bodoh satan
aku nak aku nak pergi nak pergi jumpa kawan kawan eh like then after that kita tengah joget joget so usually when I go
like clubbing and K I'll go with my friends and then after that we just joget joget together like just guys it's just like playing around by ourselves then after that at one point of time there was this group of girls
also happened to be there and then after that they like trying to like like my friends all like ikut dia orang ah
I sendiri
and after that this girl came up to me then after that she like started macam joget depan I
and after that I pusing belakang then I was like eh bodoh sia lah sempit sia and then I the girl then I they all were like what the fuck sia
kesian the girl tak buat salah sia kena
marah ya sia
hose testing tu apa like you just turn on the thing ah
oh dah buat salah sekarang buat baik pula
baik hati ah
merepek sia
what time you balik
ya okay lah that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like turun
tujuh setengah kan
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I malas so I tidur I tidur in like the they have like a mass hall but atas ah on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else tidur on the first floor and then I tidur on the second floor
habis naik atas like pukul satu pagi then I was like eh ma'am I I go sleep first ah then she like oh K K I see you upstairs
bangun pukul sembilan pagi sia
when I when I went back into the office sia lah semua day crew and then they all like eh you this shift what why you come late then I was like no encik I night shift sia
ya pukul sembilan bangun
then after that nak kena sign out kan the reservist nya attendance sheet
night shift nya semua paramedics dah balik then I was like eh encik macam mana sia then he's like ah never mind I sign for you I sign for you
takkan nak begitu sia lah
balik on the dot sia
orh me and my friends selalu keluar eat breakfast lah so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics balik station ah
one time we naik basikal
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already pergi entah mana nak makan lah or something then my friend kata eh sia lah aku tertinggal aku ni barang ah
then after that we cycled back and then we masuk the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper macam
habis dia orang keluar then after that the suay suay the is like oi bicycle siapa ni then I was like encik encik bukan saya punya bicycle
eight bicycles like parked beside the siapa tak bingit sia
twenty percent a quarter of them ah dapat shock
no most of the time if dapat shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
so the pulse dah balik ah
no no when was the last time the patient like dia orang sampai dia dah dah gone kan so like how long before that did they last see him
orh like depan mata ah
kadang eh the
when I went back reservist the medic told me sekarang they make it compulsory sia
kena like you you have to have the my responder app
then after that sekarang dia orang enforce like you have to download
then after that if you dapat the notification kena pergi ah I mean if you tak nampak then bo pian lah but
apa lagi case err the community responder was
habis the this the this captain the the dia dulu macam medical officer
habis my my kawan nampak dia tengah belakang was like belakang selalu macam lepak lepak ah
then after that dia nampak the captain dia terus eh sia lah
my the the responder is captain ah then after that he told us macam
macam take charge of the scenes semua then I was like eh sia lah uar uar sia aku give kau lesson engkau buat bodoh jer macam tu
one of my last few duties ah like my err the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate sia resuscitate the patient dapat we gave like I think three or four shocks
but the nyonya was quite tua already
the dia orang dah tolong this nyonya out of the toilet then she terus collapse so like right from the mata ah then they immediately call
eh usually cardiac arrest kalau pagi pagi kan it's usually a macam orang baru bangun baru bangun then they jumpa the body then it's like dah beberap jam ah so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you dapat cardiac arrest
tak boleh save ah
and kena buat betul betul lah that time apa lagi
err my last duty in like my last duty ever kena dapat call the this ah pek he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we sampai and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court ah
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor datang so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor buat you know like got a there's a pace one when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
then doctor buat macam macam jackhammer sia don't know what
macam begitu then after that macam eh pukimak ini apa sia ini rabbit pe and then after that my paramedic my paramedic tengah jalan
then lepas tu he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
sia lah dia buat apa sia then I was like betul in public K buat betul betul
the doctor the doctor buat sembarang then we after that we all like what the fuck sia the doctor you know
that's why like tak tahu malu ke like
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew kan you will gaduh over who gets to do
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you kena letak the lah the set up the set apa
buat the adrenaline kasi the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you buat salah you kelam kabut you don't give it to the paramedic on time kena maki
so like everybody will gaduh over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I penat
I know my encik was the one who came up with the vehicles sia there like that was his project
I think ya tak salah I heard they got the thing for macam orang morbidly obese
cause the normal the normal alpha sekarang is fucking kecil sia like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
mm the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also boleh
the new alpha is freaking sempit sia like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite sempit already
plus the dengan the stretcher kan
like you don't need to angkat the stretcher like you just picik the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves bodoh tak nak taruh in ambulance when we actually convey patients ke mana yang sedia
rabak sia
wait the the guy also a medic ah tu
actually ah the my last cardiac arrest case like bila balik reservist ni we also turn out with and then after that I nampak kan
so far dia orang asyik suruh the boy yang buat then after that yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian sia
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like tak
like lepas tangan so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment ah like we put in the apa tubing semua
and then after that so like free up free our hands lah so the crew yang buat
and then after that like I tak pernah nampak anyone wearing orange bunker gear buat so far is selalu the firefighter
tak ah
what you all turn out pakai bunker gear pe
tak stress ah
oh then nasib baik sia nasib baik ada the fire fight
sekarang it's that's damn short sia so dulu dulu during my time kan the attachment was like two dua tiga tahun begitu
so like basically the whole and then semua turun then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is ah like I'm sure there's like some
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people buat the medical staff lah the semua
but then sejak COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
apa fire site
I get lah if you want to be ons but tapi ko nak kacau reservists buat apa sia
baru juga ah
double meaning tu apa sia
so it's basically covering the punya
oh so if turn out then you ikut if turn out also you ikut ah
oh rabak
rabak pe
penat ah
mana siap lah at least you dapat
last time tak ada kan your tak ada you get to face
a'ah mampus I I loh
then macam kawan pekik
the officer just bawa lah then he just continue
ya tak probably ah
but I already do two cycles tak pernah dapat sia the card terlupa
then tak pernah they never give
the no lah it's not like we go through the full benda lah cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
and then they have the mannequin habis kena buat lah then they measure
I think it's just paper work ah so they like when you balik reservist then they said like oh we all got the cert already so we can turn out for cardiac arrest
was you ajar I
you taught me the hiemlich kat rumah atuk
I remember you that time you you masih botak I think you still in that time then you got to
and you keluar apa buka and and then after that you you told me right eh you know what I learnt or not then you started doing the hiemlich on me ajar pe
I had I had one this one time in got this one nyonya she said like oh I I'm choking
and then after that we sampai sia lah this nyonya fucking waste our time sia then she like mati mati she said like oh I can feel it in my throat I can feel it in my throat then we asked her what you eat she's like oh
that one is a different bodoh like if you are if you are actually choking you cannot talk but you should be able to sign if the person is right in front of you you confirm can like sign say you choking what
but like if you can berbual and tell the operator on the phone that you are choking then after that the the ambulance sampai
then you can buka the pin you can walk to the door buka pintu then you like oh I I choking just now I ate this nut I can feel it in my throat
I turned to my paramedic that time I that time I tengah ah so like my perangai already like like half fuck ah
then after I turned to my paramedic then after that he like I I told you macam cakap buang masa sia then after that my paramedic's like eh lain kan lain kan
then after that she takut then I was like then what the fuck you want sia
bingit sia
ya but I orang
my paramedic penakut so he convey
ya orh it's more of like he malas want to
ya she mati mati want to go
that one I bingit
like my friends all they say like oh sia lah they they malas want to turn out for like rabak punya call
but like I'd rather go for rabak call then the call is just waste my time
I mean macam ini kes bodoh bodoh sia then it's just like naik marah sia
got one time apa lagi this budak dia dia dia call ambulance dia kata like oh I I I tried to kill myself so we gotta rush down lah we thought like apa jadi
cepat cepat ah pergi
then we sampai already then we ask him what what what did you inject you tell us specifically so we like dia orang cari macam bleach bottle ke apa on the floor then he said oh I swallow this uh I swallow coins
the budak the budak call
or whatever then after that he complained complained complained then I was like no no no why you swallow the coins like you you want to kill yourself I understand why the coin then he like I don't know what to do then after that my paramedic marah me he's like eh abang kau tak boleh main main then I was like it's a legit question though what the fuck
ya after that my paramedic like he my my paramedic don't let me talk to the patient already he like kau duduk kat tepi kau main main
that one pecah nyawa nyawa on another level and that wasn't me there wasn't me that wasn't me I that one I tak berani the the kind of thing I don't play

uh patut tadi keluar habis hujan lebat gila
mm besok mungkin uh nak pergi uh beli beras tengok ah macam mana makan kat luar ah
uh belum tahu tengok cuaca
uh dia pergi memancing oh tapi tak jadi tak tahu ah tadi dia pergi tadi dia dah siap-siap tau lepas tu dia dia keluar lepas tu kejap lagi dia masuk balik lepas tu dia cakap uh gerimis lepas tu dia taruh balik the barang-barang pancing dia lepas tu kejap lagi dia duduk kat kerusi so tak jadi lah tu sebab tu dia kat situ
dia hantar kat kedai omar tadi uh uh petang tengah hari
a'ah sebelum hujan
cuci carburetor jer
oh full service dah cakap dah dah tanya dia dia cakap boleh buat sendiri huh
ah tak pasti mungkin kot pasal abang ayie dah pass two A kan so dia nak bawa motor tu kan
uh ya by the way kan tadi kita berbual pasal dua belas dua belas uh actually you can also buy grab vouchers or cinema voucher in shopee tau it's a good deal macam you just pay five dollars but the cinema voucher is worth nine dollars
ah see how lah if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers ke or I will buy the cinema vouchers
so dia punya is testing so so maksudnya dia uh
oh okay okay so kalau kalau nak apply macam uh position apa yang most slightly akan take your cert take uh takes graduates
rovers okay then kalau uh uh how macam mana boleh pakai cert tu untuk apply kalau boleh jadi apa
uh dekat uh poly macam ni ah the the normal the five poly's one of them so uh bayar ah ke oh diploma
oh bagus eh tapi tapi dia join dia join under uh full time staff or contract staff
contract tapi dia tolong untuk further studies oh that's good ya I think most likely dia dah dapat diploma dia akan take dia akan take
oh okay okay then uh ada apa-apa lagi tak kerja yang macam
mm bagus lah tu
kalau ah
okay lah tengok ah macam mana rezeki nanti try lah
apa tengok apa ada opening apa lagi
the the uh turkey right ya yang tujuh setengah tu jangan lupa so nak beli apa untuk alesya
for spark ke X one R
oh actually okay very simple okay untuk motor-motor uh spark atau motor X one R ni
takkan sentuh satu benda pun selagi tak bayar owner dia duit
so akan just naik jer
dua-dua uh under ayah punya nama bukan nama kita kereta jer so um
dia punya plan kan is uh dia punya plan uh kalau
uh dah ada motor yang bagus
ataupun kalau takde tapi nak naik yang ini so akan uh beli lah buy over so bayar ayah let's say X one R X one R worth berapa sekarang
okay so maybe bayar dia dua ribu beli beli dari dia okay okay ni just misalnya lah so kalau betul-betul nak buat something eh uh uh nak pakai X one R tu jadi spare and nak nak repair hantar kat rumah kan so kita nak kena bayar dia jadi kita nak keluarkan nama dia so akan bayar dia just like token ah I takkan bayar full sum okay motor not good condition so maybe dua ribu lepas tu uh baru hantar kedai baru akan taruh duit
so sekarang tak bagus jangan kacau apa-apa because motor tu takde nama takde full ownership so macam tu lah cerita dia so sekarang bila naik kan dia dia punya motor dah start bising tapi dia kata dah adjust
chain tapi tak tahu ah kena try lagi
sebab dia sebab dia bising apa ah
tengok ah macam mana so tu lah plan dia kenapa ada siapa-siapa minat bawa X one R atau nak betulkan berapa banyak motor nak ada ya tapi faham kan that means kalau sesiapa nak lumba
tahu tapi faham kan because selagi benda tu kita punya kita tak boleh ubah
nanti dia akan jadi part dua so nak buat apa-apa pun nak kena beli over itu motor atau at least letak duit jadi tutup story tu nanti lah dulu tengok kasih kita fikir because ada chance uh uh I prefer uh lagi suka nak beli motor uh apa nama dia
uh lupa lah nama dia uh no no bukan kapcai uh yang macam uh azri nak bikin tu apa nama dia ya tapi uh no two B two B tu kirakan uh dia kirakan bukan W two hundred kirakan nak beli yang siap dia dah bikinkan ah mm so kalau uh tu kan banyak pakai duit kan so kalau nak beli nak nak pakai duit untuk motr gitu then
takkan nak buat nak spend tu duit untuk motor motor kapcai gini
so uh sampai kita dah beli motor idaman uh jangan fikir langsung nak buat apa-apa dengan X one R ni
ya tu plan dia lah tapi
it's this um objective dia sama selagi motor tu ada tuan dia jangan pandai-pandai godeh kau siapa yang nak jawab
ya lah so tu jer lah cara dia uh kalau betul-betul nak kena beli jer ah jadi uh takde orang akan bising
itu jer lah
mm so uh bagus tak idea kita
boring tapi kalau kita dah ubah suai nanti kalau ada apa-apa masalah siapa yang nak tanggungjawab
mm fikir tapi okay lah nanti bayar dia dulu lah tengok lah
uh apa cerita dengan abang yang dekat hougang tu dia nak bawa uh dia nak dia dia masih nak bawa delivery tak
ke tu saja jer dia cakap apa dia cakap apa
ya then when you tell him that what did he say it was was he serious or he was just uh just berbual kosong
then um kenapa uh sekarang baru nak buat ni pasal dia selalu ada uh apa free time apa dia tapi dia kat rumah main game kenapa dia tak pergi buat this delivery job
so sekarang dia dah relax ah baru ada time
kurang lah
dia nak buat delivery ah
eh dah bilang dia nak kena bayar uh bag dia semua dia cakap apa
okay tapi tak cakap apa-apa pun senyap jer so maybe berbual kosong ah
tengok ah macam mana
eh oh okay nanti dia datang rumah tengok ah dia ada cakap pasal ni ke tak
so dia nak beli motor apa yang kat bawah tu
mm a'ah tak faham pasal uh bukan ke uh start topic ni cakap pasal dia nak kerja delivery so kalau dia nak kerja delivery kenapa nak pinjam duit untuk beli motor scrambler macam motor dia bawa dia patut pinjam duit untuk beli motor biasa motor kapcai hmm
tapi uh okay so kirakan takde link ah dengan delivery sekarang ni pasal dia nak ada link juga
nak dua ah delivery and also untuk dia
tapi dah dah bilang dia lah kalau nak bawa delivery pakai uh scrambler susah
so boleh nampak kan yang macam tak make sense kan oh uh tahu tak bila dia mati eh
tahun depan so that's why ya
then dia cakap apa kenapa kenapa dia terkejut
then dia cakap then dia cakap apa
ya jangan main-main bilang dia kalau dia buat benda ni dia akan kena boleh kena buang eh
tahu tapi tahu tak tu boleh jadi dia jangan jadi viral
ya lah so so kerja apa shift but ah by the way dah boleh kerja roo tau
dah boleh start kalau nak dia bayar bagus tau tadi sebelas dollar sepuluh
oh macam surcharge gitu ah oh
ya but I didn't uh tapi tak tahu tau yang dia naikkan dia punya docket pasal hujan ingatkan pasal distance pasal distance dia pun jauh juga
berbaloi uh apa um apa lagi eh ni deliveroo ya so dah boleh naik dah boleh uh log in dah
then ah grab pun dah boleh
tapi grab is lima dollar kalau satu trip deliveroo uh equals to tiga no uh dua trip grab
ya ya tapi tak tahu tahu uh the distance uh pasal that time roo punya is jauh
tapi jauh bukan jauh gila ah jauh macam jauh paya lebar
ayah dulu first kerja ayah kerja apa
wah kalau gitu ayah kerja lama seh adik tak boleh imagine seh kalau macam kerja lama gitu
sampai about how many years eh ayah kerja dekat alfa laval
sekarang nak cari kerja dua puluh tujuh tahun hais macam tak pernah dengar seh ah
so bila ayah kerja dulu dekat uh alfa laval then you don't think macam maybe there's a better job out there or something like that
memang dah planning kan dah kan
so ada apa yang macam very interesting tak yang dulu bila ayah kerja kat situ apa dia punya mesin ke like the machine dia style tu
tak ayah cakap tadi dia pakai apa sledgehammer
yang the the like the big punya sledgehammer itu ah
wah kira kan bagus seh pakai allen key jer senang seh
nowadays macam actually banyak like really a lot of things dia orang nak tukar
jadi macam manufacturing kan even macam sekarang
like now my workplace macam construction ah pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam manufacturing
ya ya ya ya actually true ah so macam dia orang ah actually dia orang nak buat kan benda tu ah datang jer kan
terus terus in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish ah
ayah rasa the houses eh because now they actually want to do a house
ah yang pagar kayu tahu the whole you imagine eh macam the whole building
mm actually kalau macam they use wood kan dia orang cakap ah it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like uh the wood banyak tapi macam macam uh the besi is steel kan dia orang kena mine
ah so that's why like uh kalau kayu kan senang dia chop jer lepas tu dia dia process
kan cepat habis dia punya plank tu banyak
sekarang macam dekat dalam news kan dia kan ada banyak cerita macam climate change ayah dengar tak cerita ni
macam dia cakap oh dia ada ah perubahan alam
ah dia ada tukar macam oh ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula ah you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly eh tempat tu tak banyak snow
oh yang itu ada ah
so kalau macam ayah
ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak over the years eh yang in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the udara ke or anything like that
so ayah rasa macam tak apa ah kalau dia lagi banyak shopping centre then
this climate change tu kira kan boleh boleh adapt ah
tapi ah so far ah ayah tak tahu anybody yang got this COVID right
so ah pada ayah macam yang this ah COVID ni ah ayah think will last how long
tapi dia orang cakap mm dia orang cakap mula mula it comes from china kan because like dia punya china tu dekat situ kan
dia orang ada dia orang they like to eat a lot of like macam weird weird punya animal tahu
oh so macam ayah fikir actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
ayah baca tak yang there's this uh group of people kan yang dia orang army plane habis lepas tu dia orang
ah dia orang fikir oh never mind lah because it's a private plane habis dia orang turun kan lepas tu yang eropah punya
the europe punya people say eh ah don't come because you're from ah please go home
ah ayah baca tak
oh ya dekat dekat eh the inside of the dormitory kan it's really uh it
according to my workers ah dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada ah but unfortunately lah kirakan kalau you're from china eh yang the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix dengan yang chinese because dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya tapi sekarang is like tapi of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the uh sickness because if not then people will be very macam macam racist kan dengan dia orang ah pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak ah actually
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad kan macam aku I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
oh is it abang abang punya party
oh the the khatam quran party is it
oh I don't remember kena check temperature actually
oh dah boleh clear ah
tapi ayah rasa like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada benda lain in yang ayah ingat ah that is the worst thing than this COVID
so uh apa tu jadi if now eh bila ayah tengok macam movie movie macam zombie zombie kan
ah ayah continue tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang kan now you feel like you're already in the movie
ada cerita yang paling takut tak what story is like super takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang ah
tapi that cannibalism is not even fake seh it's not it's not like zombie
but in the story kan dia orang macam cepat gila kan like the they the they run you know
orang hantu apa seh itu
oh so you're actually like actually the actual human yang human yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada
so macam hantu biasa macam ah you can just
walk away ah katakan
tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah retire kan so ayah rasa freedom tak macam
I I don't need to care about like all this you know hantu or all these you people
so ah apa tu jadi bila ayah dah retire so after dah you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work ah macam gitu
so ah apa itu bila dulu kan ayah
um mula mula start kerja then you said that the kan ayah ada kerja kat tempat glass kan
ah so dulu dekat singapore dia ada banyak factory eh pasal I don't think sekarang ada company glass dekat singapore
dia punya cerita semua sama eh kena retrenched ah
macam kirakan fated ah
so sekarang kirakan macam free and easy
ah then everyday bangun and then just macam
uh buat itu ah uh if there's planning today then just buat jer lah gitu
so ayah rasa macam hidup gini all the way till the end okay ke tidak
so kalau actually eh macam sekarang kan dia banyak gila technology kan
ah ayah rasa technology ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam technology ni macam
susah kan nak cakap
dulu ayah favourite subject apa eh like when in school lah
so bila ayah when you read kan those kind of stories kan do you feel macam actually bila dia jajah satu country tu dia bagus ke um good or bad
so bila dulu uh kan yayi is actually malaysian right
oh yayi
oh actually so pasal tu nyai will come to singapore
so tapi yang that time yang yang yang apa tu the the separation kan
dia dia announcement ke apa
so it was actually senang gila seh
oh so actually you got lucky ah kirakan
so actually macam ayah pun tak march sangat ah kirakan
actually dulu pun like when I first err fikir kan like what to do kan actually I also wanted to join uh the army
because like the army macam to me macam dia semua macam easy ah kan
ah then lepas tu you you you can rise up the rank and then kerja dia macam not so bad lah
tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam army pun macam apa tu stoning kan dia orang ikut the rules and then
ah macam pelik kan it's like what what what's it for ah but I mean I can maybe understand lah dia orang semua nak untuk buat
like you're disciplined tapi there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
macam somehow dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu suddenly everything macam not so bad
quite positive kan ah macam oh you can remember the good times ah
ah it it like life is like that kan macam dulu like apa tu err that time when the adik dalam police eh oh my god sia
like so hot and then lepas tu dia punya push up don't say ah
ah dia punya push up dah apa tu wah sekarang sekarang nak buat push up macam gitu pun tak boleh seh tapi dulu wah you know so good you know
ah and then lepas tu dia orang and then dia punya army officer semua cara dia sama kan
ah dia
muka kirakan semua macam yang itu ah yang kak inah tak minat
so macam dia orang semua nak kena they have this macam angkuh punya muka ah eh
ah tapi tak tahu ah maybe it's just not fated ah that I you know that I didn't join the army ah forget it sia tengok
a'ah tapi bagus juga seh kalau hari hari pakai uniform senang seh like you don't need to think you wake up
ah so macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam MINDEF kan so like although he's in construction eh
dia nothing to do with him you know eh whatever that happen outside eh dia macam oh okay
macam MINDEF kan is very big so kalau dia orang if there's anything eh dia orang nak kena buat
ah in within the MINDEF itself ya dia orang mesti nak ada manager yang kat dalam yang boleh buat construction
macam ya like no feeling to scared ke takut ke kena buang kerja nothing ya
tapi ayah dah err I mean like I you speak to them sekali sekala ah at least
apa sal ada banyak secret ke
so mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya then uh too bad lah because like you're in warehouse pe
actually ayah dulu ada license apa eh
ayah ada license forklift kan
ya lah macam wasted money ah pasal call crane
ah lah pasal macam sama ah macam construction kalau ada crane masuk kan it's like oh my god seh
like dia orang semua like you cannot even walk there and then ya
ah actually servicing kebanyakannya is really buang habuk
dia dia buang habuk jer lepas tu nanti is if if really something wrong kan
ah dia cakap ah change part jer ah semua
maybe pun tak gerak seh pasal there's not much things kan sekarang
ya so sekarang macam the situation dengan si COVID ni is a bit weird kan pasal banyak benda macam just stop
pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang kan macam like ke apa tu yang the funny thing is that yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik ah habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru seh
ah is aku I don't even use the baju half of the time in pyjamas macam I pergi kerja pun pyjamas ha
dulu kirakan macam so bila ayah dah masuk warehousing tu then lepas tu like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard lah kirakan
ayah tak pakai itu ke umbrella
so it's like macam after you get out kan macam lain gila kan macam
itu ah kerja actually macam technical officer is actually pretty ah dia dia actually quite senang
a'ah so itu ah so tengok ah maybe adik pun will just become a technical officer ah
pasal kau if like you kerja all the way construction
is like lagi senang nak check orang punya kerja kan daripada nak buat you punya kerja sendiri
ah itu lah dia tapi actually sekarang kan dia orang banyak yang ah banyak
dia orang suka just berdiri and then suruh orang lain buat they don't want to go down themselves
itu yang masalah dia ah itu yang banyak yang macam singapore punya manager ah yang susah
I mm so you're saying like dia tak tahu ah actually
actually that's true ah itu yang dia punya the difference kan I think we talk about this before yang macam if you work for a
ah if the kalau dia punya engineer turun kan daripada australia ke apa then kalau kau tak turun dengan dia kan
ah then dia macam tengok engkau hello I'm going down sia you not going down meh gitu a'ah
ah tapi kalau macam singapore punya wah clean ah berdiri jer kasi yang the poor bangla eh ah
a'ah tapi tu tapi sekarang bangla semua pun tak ada
pasal sekarang pun dah ah semalam I met my friend
dia cakap on construction site kan cuma ada enam belas orang
adik cakap construction kau kau buat apa seh pondok
sixteen people to finish one construction wah bila masa nak habis sepuluh tahun pun tak habis
aku rasa a'ah satu swimming pool habis dia cakap no no no no I need to to build a school
habis adik cakap habis adik cakap dia punya school ni
dah setengah jalan ke or baru start baru start seh
tak cukup ah ah habis dia orang cakap ah they keep saying eh macam oh ah they giving green light green light
tapi yang green light ini actually belum
uh still go to the construction site mostly all cannot ah itu dia punya problem ah
ah so ah itu yang I don't know when to finish ah dia punya project habis dia orang kita so macam sixteen eh
habis kau imagine eh macam nak carry benda tapi nak kena distance uh tak boleh kan very weird lah dia punya rules
ah tapi tak tahu ah ini bila nak habis kan mm so tengok ah macam mana
tapi apa tu ayah ayah tengok tak yang macam yang dekat america banyak orang tak nak pakai mask
tapi pelik kan I don't know why macam dia orang err apa tu really really go against err apa tu dia ah nak pakai mask ni padahal pakai mask tu macam tak ada apa apa per
ah I don't know ah when when is this going to end pun really not sure
ya so tengok ah apa tu harap harap everything is okay lah kan
so tak tahu ah tengok ah macam mana habis mummy tak cakap apa apa ke
yang pasal yang macam COVID ini ke apa
ayah ada berapa banyak seh
wah dah dah dah planning ah
chey pasal dulu kan apa tu kan susah kan nak dapat singaporean
ten years tak boleh masuk malaysia apasal eh
so is apa untuk tunjukkan like you're patriotic ah kirakan
oh so dia dia really macam nak uh apa tu
tapi kalau macam if you go back kalau then you must take some some
letter ke atau pun macam tak atau they just tak tak tak consider you as patriotic ah
oh so kirakan macam apa tu dia dia really control lah ya
mm habis nyai is nyai singaporean
so dia bila dia convert seh
oh on the independence day itself dia boleh convert tapi apasal ayah tak convert
macam there is something ah to show like you really want to be a singaporean lah
bila ayah first uh cakap that pledge eh tapi ayah ayah sekolah pun kat singapore so it's not that hard lah
ah yang itu actually adik pun kena buat lah benda tu oh zaman zaman silam kan a'ah
ah up to you but preferably uh mungkin tiga ah three
okay okay understand okay and the next question will be what was the most memorable meal yang you ever had where did you actually have it
makan apa-apa ah macam kau pernah pergi overseas apa semua kan
but but was it like you say makan dengan ramen was it like sashimi punya type or is it cook or
oo but then then um the you say mm makan whale kan
macam dia punya texture
so you wasn't you you're like tak pasti juga lah whether it's the it's the isi of the whale of the fats of the whale
uh next question if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life apa yang you will eat like what would it be
the four seasons or you prefer macam singapore punya weather
understand okay so uh when you are in tokyo or japan kan so err for the halal restaurants that you went cause I read somewhere lah in some blogs or articles right that even though for halal restaurants they do actually serve alcoholic beverages betul ke
tu lah that's why I I read at the apa halal travel blogs mm
mm okay tell me recently ada benda like
yes skills ah kira like macam
wah you know so much about this karate martial arts semua thingy
yes so like whatever you have paid for before kan kira macam pada kau when you think back apa yang
uh engkau rasa macam like apakah sesuatu yang kau harap benda tu sebenarnya boleh jadi percuma ah
okay then after that next question ee kita dah nak our time
kalau kita dah dah tak payah kerja ah
kira activities seharian macam apakah yang akan menjadi suatu penyeksaan jika dilakukan selama lapan jam berturut-turut I would say work but
activity ah macam like working out ke
ni interesting gila ni
ah self right like uh nasihat some nasihat what would it be
maybe time time kau poly ah
kira kau poly
last kakak kerja dekat intern twelve cupcakes
um kak kerja as baker um tolong macam
ah kakak dalam err cupcake department macam tolong
apa um ah scoop cupcake better err tolong decoration lepas tu tolong macam taruh
dekat oven ah bakar lah jaga oven semua uh apa kalau ada macam bahan-bahan yang kena refill then akak kena buat
of course penat lah tapi kakak ada macam learn untuk menjadi seorang yang berdikari
um dekat kerja kakak belajar untuk uh apa selalu ada keyakinan diri um
um saling bantu bantu membantu antara satu sama lain uh haruslah komunikasi sebagai pasukan kerana uh apabila kita err ingin melakukan kerja bekerjasama
kami haruslah berkomunikasi supaya kami tahu uh uh dan dan dan kerja kita akan jalan dengan lancar yup
um kadang-kadang ada jugalah ada ada yang kadang-kadang rasa macam mereka lebih tahu
lebih lebih apa macam mereka lebih tahu lah and then ingin menunjuk-nunjuk
ah tapi ah saya tidak apa ni uh kerana mereka rasa begitu kerana mereka takut um mereka rasa ditepi diketepikan semasa bekerja then ya um tetapi
mereka juga um um ada juga merupa bakat yang sangat bagus lah mereka dah sudah mahir dalam bidang itu ya
um selalunya ada ah contoh seperti kadang-kadang aku terlambat ah masuk kerja ah
ah saya pernah terjatuhkan uh apa ni
terjatuhkan cupcake batter di lantai
uh and then habis kotor di lantai ah and then saya haruslah mop
um yang apa yang saya telah berselerakkan eh apa ni um
saya pun juga pernah tidak mengikut arahan err kerana semasa kawan kerja saya err
ingin ke waktu rehat dia telah mengatakan saya untuk jangan membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven tetapi saya degil then saya tetap uh lakukannya
selepas berapa minit kemudian saya apa uh uh bila saya tengah buat kerja saya masing-masing saya
terlupa err yang saya sudah apa membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven saya tidak mendengar saya saya tidak mendengar timer dan ia hangus
err then saya saya amat terperanjat dan juga berasa serba salah kerana sudah membazir cupcake itu
uh uh kawan kerja saya ah
err terkejut juga then menegur saya uh supaya uh saya tidak melakukan kesilapan itu lagi
ah betul kakak telah uh mempelajari untuk mengikut arahan dan jangan bertindak uh sendirian jika tidak pasti kerana kadang-kadang kita apabila kita rasa kami kita
um mungkin kakak ingin err belajar dalam bidang mengajar uh early childhood kerana saya suka berbual dengan uh anak-anak kecil dan juga ingin mengongsi err ilmu yang saya telah pelajari
err pernah satu incident apabila saya di kedai sedang ingin sedang menunggu
sedang apa um mengambil air sambil menunggu saya ternampak seorang budak sedang memain dengan bottle like yang
ia ingin flip bottle itu then
mahu uh ingin bottle itu uh berdiri dan budak itu um err melihat saya dan ingin mengimpress saya dengan dia punya skills then saya saya hanya senyum dan melihat uh adik itu dan um
uh mengatakan syabas kepada dia like good job because dia dapat flip bottle itu dan dia dia berusaha berusaha sehingga dia dapat stand bottle itu
um ya um apa apabila uh
anak anak kecil err um senyum ketawa saya gembira
um memang betul uh susah nak jaga budak-budak kecil sebab kita pun dulu budak-budak kecil tapi kalau kita orang
dah minat dengan err example bidang early childhood um
uh kita haruslah apa um kalau kita ingin tahu macam mana nak jaga anak-anak kecil ini kita boleh belajar dalam bidang early childhood kita belajar untuk uh cara untuk handle um budak-budak kecil ini
dengan but apabila sudah banyak kali uh practice err training
err cara tahu cara technique untuk berbual dengan anak-anak kecil uh yang agak mudah mudah juga
ya um sama seperti ibu bapa juga sebab uh jika we jika kita mengatakan uh mereka
err ada anak then dia orang apa kena um mengatasi masalah itu juga err untuk menghandle anak mereka
um teknologi boleh menjadi err boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah err yang faedah dia
macam dalam pelajaran uh um cikgu boleh memberi assignment kepada murid-murid um err contohnya kalau ada E learning
um anak-anak muda um
murid um dari dari um muda mereka senang untuk catch up um their skills especially in technology
mereka senang untuk uh belajar macam cara nak menggunakan teknologi dengan mudah
dan mereka juga boleh err learn new skills from the internet because um but
yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini err ialah social media um mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan
err perkara yang di luar yang trend yang yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri
err contohnya seperti uh ada seorang celebrity
mereka melakukan trend uh yang mungkin boleh membahayakan dan apabila anak-anak muda melihat itu mereka rasa mereka juga ingin melakukan
ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya um tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya
err dengan itu saya rasa social media err technology haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin
ah untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna technology dengan baik mereka uh uh techonology ialah perkara um it's a safe platform for them
um ya kakak ingat dulu bila kita kecil um kita dulu kita orang uh
usually entertain diri sendiri dengan menggunakan komputer dan ada ada game permainan di komputer dan kami err main sebanyak mungkin ia juga agak menarik
err tetapi uh kami sebab kami
err ada adik-beradik kan uh kami kena ambil giliran
dan kadangkala kami gaduh pasal err giliran siapa untuk memain game di komputer
kami juga um uh di kami melihat err cerita dalam err pada zaman dahulu lah tapi zaman sekarang uh kami tidak pakai lagi kami boleh tengok online saja
ia memudah untuk generasi muda sekarang um ya
second hand phone from you and ayah and
well um where we go malaysia I really like us going trip at where is it adik uh wherever we travel malaysia is a a fun place but most of the time we went to johor um just for shopping you know going to giant
ya I know right it's so sedap I really miss malaysia food but too bad now is COVID nineteen we had to wait until um alright everything goes smoothly um but I really miss malaysia a lot it's amazing experience
dah start lah then you just continue talking
apa like gold shop
oh okay that means if this COVID nineteen dah
is the laksa place still there there was a
mini laksa stall dulu-dulu ah when I worked at Equip

but you know it's like it's so obvious kan kalau like the whole team come early tak apa juga
like there are other people who she feels better than her lah gitu
but I also think the the colleague yang nak leave tu like just try sebelum leave just try one shot like you think any possibility to increase my pay since I'm doing more you know that kind of thing then if really you cannot then just quit quit lor
maybe because you feel like aisle way corridor pun tak not safe
can check out art ground yang dulu whether they are open or not

ya bukan friendzone tau bukan friend tau okay kalau friend tu okay tau masih ada chance tapi jauh tau ni block orh block macam
err sekarang okay I err sekarang dah unblock
dah unblock
tapi ah tak kita memang tak berbual after that
no bukan we don't talk anymore that song
ya tak
ya kak
ya kak
tak ada no I looking
hello mas apa khabar
it's okay macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana mm so what are your plans for this weekend
oh yes ahmad is there uh dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada uh think four or five kids
no lah it's okay ah rezeki masing-masing ah so are you not going out with your family today
like kesian kan
bagus lah tu boleh jaga anak-anak
bagus seh masak untuk husband all
ya but ni adalah satu uh precaution for us to take ya so kita perlu berhati-hati lah
so penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah jer
ya lah stress lah at work macam-macam
since it's the holidays kan banyak orang-orang datang uh visit museum
so kalau you nak datang dengan family nak kena datang on weekdays
uh weekend tak boleh lah pasal terlalu ramai
uh until nak queue under the hot sun pengsan pula
um tak ada lah semua kena queue macam biasa
ya so ya lah kind of sad pasal tengah holiday sekarang but we have nowhere to go
oh ya ya I've read about it but belum ada time lah to redeem tour voucher
oh I don't think ada
for kids ada tu vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
online ah so it's not that bad lah hundred dollars pun jadi lah kan
biasa lah singaporean bila yang dia orang tak complain
mm understand ya I think uh COVID nineteen ni menjejas banyak singaporean
then ya lah kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah ah nak pergi holiday pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu lah
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so pasal I think malaysia pun sekarang masih ada banyak case ah so it's still unstable lah
I think uh ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also ada bilang juga
ah no lah I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask pun can do its job lah
ya lah sekarang pun yang baru-baru case dekat tampines mall tu wah
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall terperanjat seh
uh so far tak ada pula case yang lain-lain
I mean yang in the community lah
ah because you will never know seh who yang ada penyakit ni then kita pun senang jangkit especially dengan macam
warga emas dengan kita punya parents nak kena jaga-jaga
ya I think baru semalam news uh that people are queuing over at mana eh
in place ah tapi kan from the look of the photos tak ada jer think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
ya lah that's where the christmas light up is lagi so this year has been a challenging year lah ah
ada bagus juga lah that you
tak ni lah but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to ke malaysia ke I think it's affecting business everywhere uh kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian kan
I think mm mana-mana affected
mm ya lah but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business ah cuma are required to have the mandatory swab test then uh like
tak payah lah so I I dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena swab test yang
uh kalau
kalau dibuat dengan betul tak lah rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru or trainee yang buat wah rasa lah pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali
ya I think I even my friend yang
ya actually quite kesian ah in this situation macam banyak orang ada family but
kena berhenti kerja business tutup
twenty twenty has been uh ya lah like I said a challenge lah untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan lah
measure steps ah I think which is quite good lah for all lah even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted tak boleh keluar ke apa but still it's for our own good lah
oh I do actually err I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like ah so he and his wife dah beli
ya but I don't know how berapa bagus yang reusable punya mask
tak lah because uh
bulan december err think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe nak ajak makan lah but
wah only can keluar um five lima orang sahaja
think kalau the atmosphere is different lah when you dining outside err dengan makan kat rumah kan
take care of ourselves lah think the celebration is is actually pasal kita nak kena
mm mana kita berhenti tadi
um ah awak
seorang baker awak suka masak apa
untuk family
pandai juga awak baking eh abeh kalau masak masak apa
oh untuk lah eh suami awak family awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal COVID ni
mm mungkin pasal orang dah stock up ke uh iya lah singaporean kan macam saya cakap kiasu dia orang suka benar simpan
oh beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi uh three or four packets for a family of
ya lah kesian yang orang-orang yang ya lah tak ada pendapatan mm tapi saya rasa ada juga restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
mm ya lah saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah lah mana dia orang pergi
mm betul tu uh there's a lot of platform yang go digital so I think uh everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop ah these are now necessities
ya I think uh a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can lah so it's best they do so lah during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected seh ya I think my friends either yang kena retrenched at an early age eh
ya kesian kan
I think dia tak akan take the swabber paying job lah pasal I think he has more kids at home kesian takut he'll be affected lah even though he'll be uh think
he has his reasons lah for not doing that kind even though it's uh gaji tinggi but still dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan uh
ya where should we go to makan what is your favourite food
yes the curry is uh sedap
ah ada yang baik tu boleh juga pakai app sekarang kan semua
wah see sekarang semua dah high tech
order makan pun boleh
ya at this point memang ah it's not
not right to be walking on their own tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah terexpose dengan COVID ni I think it will take masa yang panjang untuk dia orang to recover to get well ah kesian I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic kan macam I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya kesian kan
mm betul tu abeh lagi cause my parents are staying on their own kesian kan we don't get to meet them as much abeh ada some old folks tak tahu pakai smartphone so lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu so kesian dia orang so masa-masa gini lah kita patut berwaspada even though it's sad but we have to follow lah
ya lah yang generasi yang
lama mereka tak terexpose dengan internet macam kita sekarang so with this technology I think dia orang will
ah ambil masa untuk
so kesian so
macam makin kurang and there's less interaction human interaction
ya lah tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia and dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh
mm actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones lah yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya lah nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa lah
that's why it's uh important lah to untuk mereka um update dengan keep with the trend apa yang berlaku bukan jadi trendy lah cuma keep up with the times
mungkin juga lah tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga so mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat
um balik semula kehidupan yang normal
some dan hari raya
mm uh macam
kirakan contact is now minimal lah mm
sedih lah tapi macam mana
mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan lah setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya
iya lah pasal singaporean usually kalau holiday akan go overseas uh mm holiday uh tapi sekarang tengah
tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di singapore
oh bagus tu idea staycation
boleh juga awak dan family destress
mm okay lah ya lah macam saya cakap ini adalah
the new normal yang kita akan lalui tak tahu berapa lama lagi
harap bersabar sahaja lah kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua
oh itu safe distance ambassador
ah dia orang akan memerhatikan
okay lah ada yang volunteer ada yang dibayar gaji ni part of the
government agency yang united mm
mm tu lah saya pun perasan juga
tak lah mungkin mereka
berjalan-jalan untuk mencari orang yang melanggari peraturan lah tapi saya tak rasa dia orang boleh mengangkap dia orang boleh menasihat
uh dengar kata dan tak lawan peraturan-peraturan mm
oh tu mungkin dia orang volunteer daripada lain lain agency mungkin yang tak ada uniform tu mungkin
dalam bekerja lah untuk united
mm agaknya pakcik tu
uh tu dia orang tu dah nak hantar boleh lah
what mask itu kerja ah
then bila kau nak buat kau nya business sia
then bila kau nak buat you buy the materials and then you never cut

within the snap of my fingers lah with the snap of my fingers petik jari your head
tak tau
if the personality tak etol
satu ke tepi abeh macam lazy eye and then the
why do you care about his perspective when you're the one who has to look at him so mata dia jauh gila
kita poke nama sia
so kau nak jadi tour guide
tak itu those like kittens and semua is like
that we lost buttercup then aku stress gila sia then I was trying to find him and you know what was stressful about it
like around his area then lepas tu

ada tiga can missing seh
uh it's being sold by this like macam organisation where they rescue cats and everything and all the the money will go to like
err I think etol try to give a stray cat the chicken mousse the stray cat pun tak nak sia can you imagine you are hungry and you're homeless and you are a stray
I'm not saying all lah because some stray cats ada feeder what

I will jampi my lecturers to give me
I need an A then I will jampi my I will I will jampi for like a a veil that's that's covering their eyes
ya all about me lah then jampi what
like I don't bother about or like because I don't know what's the background story of their families lah then why should I waste like my jampi on them
if somebody wants to jampi another marriage or something then just tell lah why do you need to use jampi sia
so that means the hantu is okay with male what
ah okay ah why don't we split the hantu
the family using all of these but to me this is all merepek and like syirik
ya but I I really don't believe until like it it's like closer to me now alamak mama balik pula
macam pelindung for like all of us

macam orang-orang boyan and then after that come from the indonesia also what
why do you think nenek and atuk keep saying that uh mesti bapa kau pakai benda untuk mak kau and everything which I find like macam merepek sia apa sia kau percaya benda merepek ni semua but
and then the wife like macam tunduk dekat dia
and then this pelindung is fighting with etol's thing so that's why I still can think rationally like no I don't want this marriage but that thing also is like playing around and say no you want this marriage
I think kita pergi sudah lah
abeh ustaz ustaz ni ustaz ustaz ni semua berapa ah kena bayar islam punya
no we cannot get like normal ustaz what we need to get like the
the ustaz you know

why does it matter kau dah memang dah kena jampi dengan dia kalau kau jadi bini dia apa
if we have pelindung we no need to be scared what
bodoh lah ni pelindung if only I can talk to my pelindung please do your job you didn't really save me from

duit belanja kau orang cari sendiri ah macam gitu ah
okay for myself lah eh apa yang I wish for is
if like kita nak pergi vacation ke apa ke vacation at least kita boleh

then uh kalau macam tak pun kita buat plan macam pergi picnic ke apa
so whenever kita ada kita punya own car
ke kita nak beli grocery nak pergi shopping at least we got our own car
since we got a big family right ah okay lah kita ada car so
uh I want to have a baby lah at least kalau ada
stable punya ni
uh at least dah boleh ada anak
pasal ada anak banyak pakai duit nak beli pampers nak beli susu everything kan
ah so aku rasa
lebih baik uh
dah ada stable semua financial baru ada baby ah kalau tak stable nanti anak nak makan apa kan
takkan nak kebulur makan pasir eh ah jadi at least kalau kita dah ada duit ah at least we also
sebelum jadi richest pun kita nak kena pandai save duit
ah save duit you need to have plan about money ha
kalau kau dah plan ah semua jadi at least bila kau ada anak
nak hantar anak kau pergi sekolah sekarang sekolah bukan cheap eh
memang mahal lah mahal gila lah eh
lagi-lagi buku dia orang lagi baju sekolah apa semua ah abeh dia orang punya tambang pergi sekolah apa semua
abeh kau nak kena hantar apa semua unless kau nak belikan basikal ah untuk anak kau kan
basikal so suruh dia orang ajar dia orang macam mana nak kayuh basikal so at least they can
ah semua pasal duit okay lepas tu
lepas tu semua aku dah fikir fikir pasal ada anak semua aku dah fikir pasal future lah
ah then nombor tiga
aku fikir nak bawa family aku pergi holiday
mm pergi luar negeri lah pergi holiday ataupun aku pergi honeymoon sebab aku belum pergi honeymoon lagi kan
since daripada hari aku kahwin tu aku belum pergi honeymoon so that is why I'm thinking lah so at least
um dengan duit yang aku ada tu aku boleh bawa ah family aku pergi travel everything lah
tu yang aku fikir lah mm
so aku rasa yang paling penting sekali is
untuk ugh
rapatkan lagi silaturahim is dengan buat family gathering lah macam tu mm
oh that one I got heard from my mother-in-law yang pasal tu lah
my mother-in-law cakap lah yang dia dengar dekat warta berita kan since I kerja I pun tak ada time nak tengok warta berita kan
ah so bila my mother-in-law kasih tahu I macam
eh serious ah mak serious ah dapat
seratus dollar I thought is
seratus dollar in cash lah I was so happy ah sekali dia kata voucher
sekali you cakap dia orang pakai singpass lagi I cakap a'ah lah pakai singpass pula
ah that's why macam
boleh ke eh ah boleh ke tidak eh
apa yang kita tengok dekat warta berita dia orang kata tunggu lah dia orang announce kan
so kita tengok jer lah dia orang announce boleh pakai kat mana kat mana semua lah ah we just wait lah
so at least after dia orang dah announce kita boleh ni lah boleh discuss
maybe kita boleh buat vacation ke untuk kita punya ni lah
family buat family gathering like what I said lah
family gathering ke apa
kat singapore pun tak [pe] lah kan
since dia kata december baru dia keluarkan so about
then maybe from there we also can uh plan maybe buat january ke february ke
ah so kita boleh bring along our cousin
our cousin punya birthday kan uh january end of january
kita buat ah ni ah birthday party sekali ke apa ah
ah tengok lah kita nak book hotel ke kita nak book chalet ke apa ke
tak kisah lah resort ke whatsoever that we can book lah kan ah

um macam birthday party tu birthday event lah kita boleh buat event birthday party because
macam cousin kita kan uh birthday dia january then my husband punya is february kan
so uh why not kita buat end of uh january
dengan uh february pasal february first feb kan my husband punya birthday kan
ah so jadi kita dah buat ending january tu dengan first feb
at least dua hari satu ah satu malam
betul tak dua hari satu malam ah so kita boleh book so kita boleh celebrate both uh birthday
dia orang together kan ah so at least ah kita boleh ni ah bincang-bincang nanti plan dengan cousin kita macam mana
whether we want to book a resort ke
kita nak book chalet ke kita nak buat staycation ke ataupun kita nak sewa hotel ke
ataupun we also can plan want to picnic kat marina ke ah so at least
one day ke ataupun kita picnic jer kat situ sampai esok pagi so at least boleh
celebrate dua kat east coast ke west coast ke ah macam gitu lah kita celebrate ah
betul tak mm
overnight pun boleh picnic pun boleh lah kan lagipun kita semua
satu rumah what ah then yang lain dah kahwin yang yang kita nak ajak ni cousin dah kahwin ah so
it's okay since dia boleh bawa husband dia sekali ah
so maybe barang-barang yang kita beli kat daiso tu kita boleh buat sendiri lah tampal sendiri
tapi apa yang aku rasa lagi save is macam hari ni birthday our cousin kan then the next day birthday abang kan
my husband eh jadi you nak err buat macam mana jadi pukul dua belas
uh macam kita buat macam
uh eleven plus gitu nak dekat pukul dua belas so at least kita celebrate
satu kali jalan ah macam gitu kan so it's better right
so at least time kita celebrate okay uh kita dah
tiup tiup tiup oh okay okay lepas tu ah kira macam satu cake
ah then kita celebrate untuk hari ni dengan esok gitu
uh kita picnic kat west coast ke east coast ke
marina ke
err whatsoever lah payung besar sudah
actually right I got saw that time inside a website ah I not sure is it at west coast ke east coast
yang dia orang ada buka macam khemah besar tau
macam khemah kat dalam ada sofa ada macam I think it's sofa ya
dia orang buat uh ni
uh kira macam tempat murah-murah lah kat macam
yang kau boleh ni ah kira boleh chill chill dia orang cakap
sekali aku tengok eh
aku cakap eh not bad siak dalam ada ni eh
ah ni ah dia orang tengok ada table kecil aku tengok abeh lepas tu sofa
ah itu betul-betul khemah khemah macam khemah besar so if raining dia orang cakap kau tak payah risau
but uh morning I want to do some activity you know like rock climbing ke zipline ke if
abang to mm
but tak tahu lah eh tengok macam mana ah
nak buat apa seh
mm confirm like macam dah lah panas terik
ah lepas tu tengok-tengok binatang berpeluh-peluh lagi lepas tu ketiak semua nanti basah aduh
mak kan tengah sakit also right so
maybe dia orang akan bawa lah
takkan tak bawa kan gila tak bawa kan
dia orang pun kan tak boleh tak boleh hidup tanpa anak dia orang kan
confirm kalau shopping kita punya cousin
adik intan mesti memang suka suka gila shopping
especially kalau dia tengah ada duit dia memang suka shopping shopping tak habis-habis shopping baju baju baju
baju ah
so aku rasa
maybe lah kita just go with the yang pergi berkelah tu lah
lagipun kita dah lama seh tak pergi berkelah
a'ah seh picnic picnic picnic tak picnic picnic
but I think your abang
ah confirm dia cakap eh huh kenapa tak cakap siang-siang
ah akan save pe duit
then you can see pantai also ah
ya but I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
you feel like not bad right eh macam eh cantik pe view dia
eh why not I memang nak pergi
but I thought of going with your abang lah that time
kau tengok ah selalu jer kita busy busy busy macam
since dia kerja aku kerja
kan so tak ada time
then balik rumah pun buat kerja rumah
gedebak gedebuk semua ah so tak ada time lah
plan actually aku dengan abang kau macam macam tau plan
even aku
kita plan
nak buat rock climbing sama-sama ah
zipline ah ni semua
that's why I would like to ni lah cari
mana mana ah tempat yang ada kan activity macam gini
so at least kita boleh buat activity ni tak tahu kat mana yang ada activity ni
ah kallang memang ada
I got saw I got saw that time yang masih
aku pergi tengok wayang dengan kak faz kau kat kallang
after kak faz kau balik kerja tu
abeh aku cakap eh tak sangka seh rock climbing dekat dalam building ni then dia cakap
next time kalau bie nak join join ah dia cakap gitu so aku macam
oh serious ah aku pun macam
betul ke boleh join ni huh
dah macam tak ada confidence eh sekarang dah gemuk dulu badan macam mana kan ah
kalau dulu tak gemuk macam gini ah okay lah
aku pun tak tahu lah
hais makan makan makan malam aje makan lapar lapar lapar makan
so that when we lepak
kita boleh ni ah
makan makan makan ah sambil lepak tengok if I not wrong have
but if tak ada
kita still boleh lepak-lepak berbual-berbual sambil makan chips chips dia tak apa ah
kita beli chipsmore ke then kita beli chips ya lah chips biskut kan
ah yang cemil-cemilan ah
but serious ah kalau kita lepak macam gitu still nak buat pit ke
barbecue pit still nak buat barbecue pit
kita masak lah kan masak lepas tu bawa
since kita like what you say nak pergi petang kan ah okay lah
ah tempat sometimes especially weekend
so I think like kita nak kena book
uh ni cepat sikit
if not kita terlambat kita tak dapat lah tempat
maybe some of us ke siapa-siapa kita boleh pergi dulu so at least
tak kisah lah siapa sampai siang kan
kalau sampai siang at least kita ada tempat tau ada tempat
ah kita dah book untuk berapa orang
ah so at least dah ada orang tau
ah dekat tu tempat
jadi tak ada orang boleh ambil ah
ah then you say eh salah salah salah tempat ah macam gitu also cannot what
energetic ah gitu
ya drama melayu sangat aduh
and like what we say kan kita nak standby duit lebih sikit is because balik
kan kita nak grab kan jadi balik confirm penat pe kita dah ada activity kan lepas tu balik penat confirm nak grab kan
so that's why that's why I cakap yang ini I rasa lagi kita boleh save
kita dah kita bawa daripada rumah benda yang boleh pack
semua pack what I think is
better rather than kita bawa satu-satu gitu
then bawa banyak pinggan
it's better that kita bungkus bungkus satu-satu pack
so bila tu kita tinggal pass jer kat semua orang
so dalam everything kita boleh letak but like macam dia punya side
macam hotdog ke macam crabstick ke apa kan
ayam ke apa itu kita boleh letak dalam tupperware lah so
anybody can ni ah cuma mi mi ke nasi
ah tu kita boleh pack dekat bungkus so at least they can
tak lah sometimes people still need nasi what you never know you the kind yang nak nasi
ha you die die nak nasi ah betul tak
tak apa it's okay ya
mi untuk semua then letak nasi dekat dua bungkus sudah
nasi letak dua bungkus tu ah letak penuh-penuh
jadi kita tak payah ni ataupun letak satu tupperware
besar untuk nasi jer because the lauk-pauk is already we put different pe
I masak nasi goreng ah
macam esok kita nak pergi activity tu
ye kita beli everything
so kita potong semua
after kita potong semua simpan dalam ice box kita simpan dalam ice box the next day baru kita goreng and everything so bila kita nak pergi
so kita potong sayur sekali kita potong hotdog kita potong crabstick kita potong
ayam ke apa apa lah
yang kita nak kena potong kan apa yang
apa-apa lah fishball ke apa ah semua lah potong sekali
if rajin ah if rajin really rajin
kita boleh cucuk cucuk ah
cucuk hotdog fishball crabstick macam gitu sedap sikit
ha gitu
kita boleh minta tolong abang ke kak nani obvious ah dia tak akan tolong dia mesti kata nak tidur
oh but abang also nanti dia tired the next day abang kerja
but like what abang see if we really want to have some activity in the morning
ya that's why I cakap letak maybe mi ke
nasi kita letak dekat benda tu that's why I cakap terus nanti boleh buang tak payah ni
kita letak dekat tupperware jadi kalau kita letak dekat tupperware
tak payah ni so kita boleh buang
oh ya ya ya lepas tu kita cover pakai aluminium foil jer aluminium foil is it a'ah
tapi kita nak naik grab tu nak kena pegang juga lah
letak kat belakang ah semua
the whole kau punya ni
ah rides kau pegang jer barang-barang tu
confirm kalau semua goreng confirm kau akan rasa bosan kan
uh something like maybe lemak cili padi ke apa
letak so kita ada kuah dengan ni
tak payah eh
roti sandwich yes
apa yang kita perlu ada since ada event kan sandwich of course kena ada
so um that's why I cakap at least I nak letak satu dish
so bila ada satu dish tu
at least ada lah lauk macam
lauk kau cuma goreng-goreng jer kau akan rasa macam bosan sebab semua goreng
so at least kalau ada lauk sikit because
kau makan apa-apa pun kau mesti nak ada kuah kan
that's why I cakap
so at least I nak buat yang lemak cili padi ke apa ah something like that lah
ya like what I say maybe I nak buat yang tu
lemak cili padi ataupun I nak buat
uh sambal goreng satu sambal goreng satu lemak cili padi
sambal goreng is for mama because mama vegetarian
kita kena fikir nanti mama cakap eh sana ayam
eh sini ayam
ya we also need to remember eh kita kena beli uh vegetable ball
dengan apa tofu mushroom ah
some kind of this kind lah uh yang kita kena beli lah pasal kita bring along mama kan
confirm dia orang akan beli yang dekat belakang ah
dekat belakang rumah dekat pe
from there dia orang akan naik grab pe like what
uh abang seth cakap kan
macam abang kau ah dia pringles pringles tu tetap dia nak
you want to buy mi eh buy pula you want to masak mi hoon ke mi goreng
I think mi hoon goreng is better right because we got a lot right
so you want to cook nasi goreng is it
so you want me to cook the nasi goreng cina
I masak nasi goreng ikan bilis lah ada ikan bilis sedap sikit
ya lah ikan bilis itu lah that is what I mean
nasi goreng ikan bilis pakai ini pe is warna putih what
okay so you help me nanti potong-potong ayam
we potong
ya you potong ayam
so pasal I nak masak lauk pe
abang suruh potong hotdog ah nanti
dua packet cukup tak dua packet tak cukup empat packet
empat packet lah eh empat packet
but one thing I don't like is because I punya cut eh of hotdog eh is different
memang aku punya is like memang
slide slide uh ni apa
slice dia macam diagonal is it
aku tak nak lah macam
kalau yang ni kecil besar kecil besar because
aku punya orang is very particular about dia punya size kalau boleh aku nak buat tapi
sandwich lagi aku tak suka nanti senget macam bersepah
aku especially sandwich ni aku tak suka very particular lah
oh takpe
kita buat macam ni jer apa kata kita buat
so sebelah sapu tuna lah
lagi sebelah kita letak egg lah egg mayo lah
ah jadi bila tu kan dia jadi sedap tau ah I think this already good lah
so jadi dia orang tak ni
jadi dia orang kalau at least dia orang spread
ah tak ada lah ni sangat kan
tak lah pasal apa kalau sayur
ya because they don't really know macam mana nak letak ah
kau pun tahu pe aku kalau buat sandwich aku very particular aku nak make sure sandwich dia nampak cantik
so beli yang ada cili punya
you know itu baru sedap
so the crust apa awak nak buat ke
I think maybe kalau macam gini
since ada sandwich and ada ni then kita nak beli
fishball nak letak ke
since uh mama tak makan
so at least kita boleh buat cheese fries
if not nanti sampai sana semua dah taste not nice ya
kita nak beli mat yang dua dollar tu
tu lah aku pun fikir-fikir juga
because when we plan like what abang say when we plan every time
mesti tak jadi seh everything tak jadi tak jadi huh
I think why not we just buy a dress for kak nadiah
then for abang uh kita beli kasut jer
at least baju kan
she really need baju

kelakar seh
is it fun intern kat rumah
bukan ke a lot of distraction like that
ya so I work from home for macam
then I feel so like terkurung dalam bilik and the wifi is not strong
so that's why I rather work kat
only like macam about two weeks
ya only two weeks dua minggu
duduk kat rumah and you know what I don't even do in my room you know I do at the living room
that's why I tadi I ask you to take a picture of your your working setting
that is me in the office kalau kat rumah I will just like duduk depan depan then my laptop
oh make the home macam office like that ah
oh then what your wifi around your houses eh around your houses around the house macam good ah
ya lah then how you do your work seh macam gitu
like because your work from home pakai pakai pakai apa Microsoft or
ya the Google hangouts you they you never break out meh macam never lag or what
ya so now buat apa
oh you've been working part time kerja apa eh cause I saw on your Instagram you work night shift all
but you are still working what okay lah tu means you dah survive sikit
kerja apa why you never explain
oh pack apa
then you work alone or what not alone right ada orang lain juga kan
kerja kat mana kat warehouse eh
uh at ibu cik house lah the difference right
one week and then you cannot tahan
it's just too fast paced ah macam mm
ya one day berapa
if you are at the first first person ah then paling senang
quality check and need to buat cepat cepat then that's crazy ah
macam from
pack for eh no we start at about oh macam lapan setengah then lapan setengah all the way until pukul dua belas
uh scoop the kuah then after that you kiap the container then you
ah pack kat kitchen ah so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because panas lah then when you kiap the container then you also will kiap your finger lah
bla bla lah then lepas balik
I mean the the packing place yang I kerja is um
express gila lah especially when you do quality check how to quality check cepat cepat seh
so that's how tired you are then now kerja apa seh kerja malam
like few months ago sekarang baru dia dapat
ya so kerja apa
then kenapa you leave
then besok buat apa the pharmaceutical one the pharmacy one
okay then kerja ini kat mana
oh dekat lah
pukul sembilan eight thirty
you've been closer right every time sekarang I always saw you and
that's why selalu macam spend time sama sama
dia pun holiday ke
ya that's why that's why macam selalu when I see your InstaStory macam eh
apasal seh
oh gitu eh macam mata merah ah kirakan
like jealous ke like oh I have a boyfriend but you don't like err
ya ya ya it's how but good thing Andy faham lah that's the thing
meet tapi masih berbual kan
like on Whatsapp or at least berbual on the phone
kau orang dua faham each other the needs and the the wants
bagus ah
show it dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan so
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is macam
together and individually so macam okay ah let's say ah so ah cause sekarang dia dah right
oh that recent stories dia tak appear lah that kind of thing okay okay
cause ah dia sekarang work as financial adviser
uh you ask me kenapa dia kerja ni pasal one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and dia dapat ah itu jer
so sekarang dia boleh go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start selling insurance or any plans
mm so that is his career so his career now kan dia ah dia
uh gender and everything else so macam
kita is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
ya ya so ah so macam macam mana eh
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his pun pernah happen I don't know eh
so macam this thing happen for the third time already
so uh basically dia dia bilang me Hans punya type punya orang is dia he's very honest
so dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa his perasaan everything to me
so at first bila dia cakap macam gitu I thought
tapi it's not explore means dia nak explore dia nak jumpa orang baru without feeling err bad
his dia ada group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for
so when he met new group of girls then tiba tiba dia macam
wow macam okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay lah sakit hati tu sakit hati lah tapi at least
it it did hurt me but it was the first time so macam okay first time let it go that kind of thing
ya but that someone that lady dia macam
dia macam sampai berbual on dia macam my no ah like
memang dia they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
like made a move lah macam message lah message the perempuan nak nak know better
kelakar kan
it's just dia punya tiba tiba the way dia layan me the way he he behave around me change
macam in terms of not good lah macam macam he he he he tell me things like err I want to explore he don't want to feel
get it because in this in dia punya line of job dia akan jumpa
betul lah ya lah professional that part it is lah but at the same time dia nak
at any point of time in his life dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing tu juga I said macam I I say to him ah I also can say the same thing to you what but I choose to focus what is in front of me
from the start of the relationship I got even I pernah bilang you what bila kita nak
boleh lah I mean you nak comment pun comment lah because honestly
ya and there's no there's no end to it macam there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion macam do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with like endless
ya so so macam
macam okay
macam dependent lah
bukan macam okay so
ya ah so macam my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
it's stupid lah tapi macam
ya lah faham lah
dia belum kan
ya lah faham lah but at least now kau orang at least ada ada so called same goal in the relationship right
get it macam
for me now with Han is really macam
a total switch a total change of goals which is now tak match
I don't know lah I really don't know I don't know whether kita are compatible or what already lah because dia memang dah ada other mindset juga
spend time yes tapi macam other stuff to talk about the future no lah because dia punya parents obviously is supportive of Hans
like a like a person like like a gundu like that tunggu macam macam
macam badut gitu but the uh
it has been weeks already ah so if I cry now also macam
it's just tears eh macam really legit sia so macam ya lah
so well I'm just updating you my relationship status so kalau we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand lah
tak apa uh it's okay not to make assumption ah but
kalau kita so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
ya so but this thing is special case I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then dia macam disagree ah dia cakap
uh hmm no he I don't know dia cakap um why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just um be friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so macam
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of kalau dia orang hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out macam gitu mm
I mm only just now I met him lah after like a week tak jumpa
but few days ago when my friend ajak me hang out then I asked ada siapa kalau ada Hans I say to them I tak nak join
mm tapi ya ini susah ah susah
she she sense it lah so macam mm
the group of friends yang I bilang pun macam
so this issue macam I really tak nak bilang orang but
ya tak lah I think pasal I'm just too macam
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two masih boleh jumpa orang lain and stuff tapi
ya ah so ya dah itu jer lah
kadang kadang seh dalam kerja so macam if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out ah
then suddenly benda tu come in
then when benda tu come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when tadi you bilang me kan ah what time you sleep and stuff right
twelve tahu
sometimes I habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan
lepas tu I'll just hang out talk I just like err but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so macam
okay I do Zoom meetings at at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I baru balik that kind of thing then once I go home
then it affected my work in terms of productivity lah I lupa benda I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
ah your rumah macam tukar hari hari seh
then before raya I think I went to your house once also different theme then raya also different theme
then sekarang
it's only your room tak involved lah
but the thing is I don't like to work in my bilik pasal wifi tak strong legit tak strong
ya mm me me and my adik already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
because this wifi sucks you okay for example ah kalau sekarang you go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
I always do outside kalau tak I'll just do at other places
so macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi to my room
mm patutlah boleh lah gitu ya then I need to pasang one more loh
tak ada lah but
just now punya meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy kan no it's macam gini so you kerja macam biasa
like on the same track check in apa task you buat ah
macam gitu lah penat seh so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
they also have still to do they still need to do their kerja kerja biasa
that is why at night we need to do meeting pasal everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
macam gitu lah ya ya ya correct correct ya
err at pukul sepuluh no worry lah can can
err macam jadi inspection macam inspect the homeless ah I don't know lah apa lah
merepek gila ah because I mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
oh so you your pay macam mana bila internship
wow ya it's just it's just poly things poly memang
is it tak tahu lah sekali five hundred juga eh
ah then go ahead bro ambil jer
ya then after that you can decide bila you nak continue degree or
you're you're the type yang boleh belajar what I'm not so
no need lah ah now I'm like thinking nak ambil ke tak ah tapi tak apa lah no need ah
ya I'm thinking of that lah but tengok ah
mm tengok yang last sekali
mm nasi ayam
sustenance wise memang boleh lah tapi kalau fikir sangat pasal
the taste I think can be very boring cepat muak as well
hmm I don't really like mee kuning
boleh lah
peliknya ah do
and I tak faham dia cakap pasal apa
steamboat macam dekat
ada wire
itu lah kalau lama-lama nanti sesak hidung mm
mm ya good first time lah tak pernah try mala
tetapi kan
pun boleh kata macam muak juga lah
tak boleh lama-lama sangat lah makan
tetapi ini sedap lah
rasa sikit-sikit kan
ya so kalau private they
dah bagi timing lah nak datang hari apa and at what time
oh macam acid reflux ah
I kena malam itu just berapa like a few nights ago ugh
lepas itu nak kena bangun pagi untuk kelas like pukul lapan or
mm nak
tetapi kan takkan setakat nak beli satu sahaja tempat
so macam child best situation ah
err I think season four baru nak masuk
dia buat makeup dia macam itu ke
but I feel macam
I mean memang ah it's a show but it's too overplayed
macam terlalu drama lah
I know dan is jadi gossip girl tetapi macam tak make sense eh story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
mm sebab boleh nampak mm
dia macam he in one scene dia pun terjekut he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so dia texting diri dia sendiri lah kan
tetapi kan kalau
kalau theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl boleh masuk akal
ya or macam
ya and the fact that dia dapat marry serena pun macam err
serena and then he talk trash about her dekat gossip girl
mm raccoon lah bapa dia pun sama jer
tetapi wait dia punya part
part rambut itu
no lah dia punya hairstyle dia kadang-kadang macam tak match
eh dia dalam cerita star trek
oh bukan eh
uh siapa baru give birth tak eh
oh bukan bukan dah lama dah
apa seh
I mean I'm saving up all the cerita for after exams
mm tengah belajar
so nak kena make sure lah
kena make sure betul-betul nak yes
macam interesting jer
psychology is something you can take on tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa
time duit and betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja
uh well selalunya orang cakap two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
but tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil
ada duit ada time tapi kalau tak ada dedication macam buang masa
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you ada lah these three
perangai melayu yes
ya lah fikir pasal duit lah sekarang memang okay
but kalau nak ambil one more
and kalau
personal betul
why kenapa
tetapi kan ambil lesen
nak fikir pasal sekolah so kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena divide
exciting itu memang lah but sekarang I pun tak ada kereta
ya tetapi kalau tak ada macam
kalau tak ada use for kereta
macam waste of time itu sahaja
ya lah I sudah biasa sangat naik public transport
yes yang pasal the drawing mm yes
it's like an accomplishment dalam hidup
not seven wonders ke
I think so wah kaabah sendiri pun tak tahu
okay so america then europe tak ada tempat lain dah ke
apa try studying
tapi itu lah
change starts with you so kalau nak start saving
mm you know boleh is very forgiving
tapi nak kena tengok juga jangan potong too close
apa semua nak kena ada allowance
so I think it got a bit derailed sebab exam kan banyak focus dekat exam so dah tak fikir sangat lah like I think
ya so I think maybe selepas
yes selepas exam maybe dapat masuk balik lah then
ya tapi bila buat sendiri is tak as senang as dia tunjuk
ya memang banyak video tetapi I underestimate how
mm I thought is macam yang
speaking of I think my kawan-kawan are planning like a dinner or something
uh tak dah bangun selepas itu tertidur tapi bangun balik dah macam terlajak
mm tengok cerita incredible tales
tapi cikgu itu forgiving lah dia cakap okay tak apa lah it's late but I will mark as present
mmhmm apa dia
err ya I agree as well belum buat banyak pun macam uh
nanti dah tak ada moral lah
ya tapi bunuh satu pun dah macam mana
otter satu biasa pun dah besar macam mana
okay lah at least dah tahu lah apa nak cakap
for me kerja dekat bakery pun masih ya allah pun masih boleh can
mm weekend shift kan of course lah weekend orang semua datang enjoy bawa family
bawa family exactly
mm tetapi
itu lah takde tempat lain ke
dah lah dah dapat hundred dollar voucher pun masih nak datang dekat bakery lagi
ah tak tahu lah nak pergi nanti macam waste pula
entah lah
eh no lah I rasa macam tak biasa saja tak biasa orang pegang
yes dia selalu
ya dia buat dekat I pakai janggut
ya lah it means memang tak biasa
tetapi ya lah I can try to biasakan
I mean apart spa you got any nowhere else to go ke
kalau ada bathtub boleh buat air panas apa
soak sahaja lah dengan sabun semua
ya hari itu I baru nampak gambar fireworks I pergi dengan kawan I for twenty twenty
then sekarang macam ini condition ya allah
I pun nak tahu this this
uh december new year macam mana
itu lah
macam concept of time macam lost you tahu
mesti benda kemaruk seh
well I think for me this year is a lot of change I mean I thought tak masuk sekolah seh
and then sekali dapat masuk poly
banyak nama lah dia
itu lah
then dia balik
tetapi the next morning dia dah tak ada dah
tetapi mama tak ada kan so dapat I
eh still I I basuhkan dia apa
daripada kindergarten K two
yes sana kan menengah lima
ya dia dia dia mati tua lah
tua tapi tak tak pandai jaga lah
no kita orang ini
tetapi kan sebab kan pasal kucing kucing macam ini it makes me realize that I will not take a pet
bila dah hidup sendiri kan tak akan ambil
mm tetapi kalau fikir balik kan if you're not there at home is
what's the point and ya menyeksa lagi ada
walaupun kucing boleh hidup sendiri daripada anjing kan
mm tetapi if you're not home
tetapi nak kena ingat juga it's a living thing
ada corner lah
ya lah there's no saturation of market lah dah tak ada orang nak beli and daripada
and kalau tak jadi pun lagi satu hal
ya then better tak payah lah this is already perfect this is nice already
mm sejuk
tetapi selalu ada orang masak curry
ya pernah ada orang itu masak curry satu malam semalam bau lepas itu I tidur bilik you
ya satu malam dia buat mm macam apa lah dia nak buat ini
lepas itu I tidur bilik you apa sebab itu lah
you tidur kat luar sebab panas
atau you nak buat kerja I pun tak tahu
mm tingkap buatkan bilik nampak besar apa
okay so is actually um in which year eh you nak get married eh
err you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a bilik or a room yang like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with lah correct or no
ya lah correct lah tapi sekarang I think you you both have to think what's the budget lah so budget actually berapa is it a combined wedding ke</malay
mm okay okay lah then I think kita we have to take a look part by part lah kan like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and um so basically is between like err in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need kan macam lik
which one you want to cut down ah on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say uh if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat lah because apparently like macam flat kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat chey sepanjang hayat ah
like I say uh the the most important thing is the the the nikah itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
um family support have to come in so that's why that day you all kena macam plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture lah that one have to be very like um
um very like uh transparent but in the event if let's say both side macam let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you ada your own plan of your uh I mean his side ada dia punya own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to fikir or think about i
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb tak so that is another another way lah kan macam kita nak um try to put everything in hand lah
so wedding time at least your side macam okay then for your side uh you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget eh sometimes kita kena fikir that in terms o
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in kita punya err orang melayu kita macam sensitive ah about duit ni so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families belum sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about duit pun kita adik-beradik masih sensitive tak boleh macam eh just bang aku mau pinjam duit kau lah satu ribu macam suka suka jer nak minta kan abang you know I have to be like more tactful to u
kak are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case lagi the other party yang your parents belum kenal kan and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you dah sample among all again okay lah kita work combine then okay celebrate buat combine tapi if let's say oh
ah you know lah I still want my one thousand guest let's say hairin punya side the
your mother say okay tak apa lah based on your budget kita invite saudara mara dekat jer one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
because there are two factors you need to think first um kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak because you all just become a new family member secon
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup lah tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh then after this the next time dia pergi rumah</malay
like macam err
tak tahu lah macam waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get err
and then july got a flat ah my kita punya timeline two years tu nak engage</malay
you know then tak tahu macam mana tahu bought flat then because ah because atuk said better
cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri then after that we are like ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle semua macam dah haywire all I received only fla
kita punya like dream wedding kita punya dream vacation semua macam dah flash toilet jer tu begitu ah so it's lik
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like macam ah my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
um makanan tapi kan shamefully I have to admit even I dah work that time kan I tak boleh afford tau because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like macam even like you know the bridal like you all have all these ah then I think I can only afford the photos begitu that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even hantaran nak exchange ah
um I think quite I I would say I like macam drag it lah but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of hantaran I think in the en
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay lah why not kita combine kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk exchange hantaran</malay
uh the equipment that include all the err the kompang and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so kita kena tengok macam mana lah kan so is lik
orang melayu kita ni actually err come with a lot of err gotong royong even though kita tak sekampung lah not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like macam pinjamkan kereta you know so when if you no
err how to say farah see you just like okay lah whatever people uh rent you okay lah something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like macam</malay
uh certain relative got this car whatever they say eh I chope your car dulu for the coming wedding can or not just ask lah
you know or maybe like dekat dekat wedding tu you ask becaus
uh dulu I in this case usually lah people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
uh we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar lah pe seh joke ah I'm not racist tau but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing lah so it was just like kita like just focu
ataupun early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out agak agak because by that time you dah start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly berapa one month berapa dapat sav
so basically you can agak agak already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one ah
this one take time lah but again uh I think hairin uh or or hairin lah siapa lah uh maybe is t
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because uh you ini kan actually masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so memang lah nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa lah kan yang mereka seems like okay okay tapi tak okay kot</malay
ya memang lah um to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like macam secara positive ya so at least that macam you know what you can um do best within this err
uh constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it lah so let's talk about happy things lah macam stress jer cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita happy pulak dalam pasal pasal wedding ni</malay
so kirakan okay actually that time you got share with me kan tentang mak andam like quality of mak andam</malay
ya okay macam itu kira not too bad lah kan because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like macam prepare and then both both parents are okay ah it's just anyway you also have time also nak save money you kno
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because um certain country dah already open kan so macam you can just like chill relax lah macam</malay
tak payah lah macam nak fikir fikir sangat kan then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house ah that's another advantage lah
ah ini pun if let's say both side okay lah I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like kita macam like okay jer like nikah is that correc
oh I think that part can't be helped right we all memang lah keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam happy happ
know you are like can can just like uh kita sama sama you know ramai ramai meraikan chey macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada lah saja mengeratkan silaturahim so I think can lah I think we jus
ah but now I think for now don't take it as uh macam sedih nak kahwin kan you just more like if all the all the err apa ni restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both kena bincang</malay
sebaiknya like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month macam kena ada like your own goals lah but if let's say if both of you like very nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want nak buat kan like macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap kan biarlah you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
um to prioritise lah then kalau let's say family kata oh no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit lah ah okay option one I let go the fla
ah that's another option lah that means to get a resale flat maybe dalam three five years that macam ah you know our relativ
some of them ada so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like uh just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
you know ah sendiri sendiri yang macam nak spend lah so if let's say if this side kata okay boleh ah can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
ah then okay then so semua boleh centralised atau pun nak separate itu another one lah ah because I thin
about tunang he can never be meet everywhere lah kan like macam semua happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation kalau let's say macam boleh</malay
then okay loh kalau tak boleh oh too bad lah because um either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
for you to uh come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor lah okay then if there's an option two that both parties cakap okay lah why not we bought uh you know yang</malay
norms lah sederhana jer like very minimal number of um err what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it lah finish okay dah tak ada lagi lah that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like macam tahu okay kita ada this amount kita ada ni kita boleh prepare macam ini ah then ah
orang ah orang mampu macam ini jer lah kan like it's like you know we can't be bo chap in everything sebab we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that err you apa ni</malay
err for you both all you want is just nikah maybe take beautiful pictures go err nice honeymoon then dah habis then after that focus kat rumah</malay
oh okay okay mas kahwin is err more important than hantaran hantaran is culture mas kahwin is agama</malay
ah so mas kahwin is part of the err macam dalam dalam term dia dalam arab is called maha</malay
so maha is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount yang kita dapat tu minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken yang kasi the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
ah you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which negeri ya dia orang lagi emphasise mas kahwin then a gift gift tu hantaran lah bagi dia orang ah that is culture melayu kita ni terbalik ah
macam ah gift tu lebih high daripada mas kahwin but right it should be another way but I think err mas kahwin ke</malay
err hantaran err for me lah I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents cakap tak nak ambil kan tapi the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way err sometimes rilek jer lah
err you can have the best of both worlds kan jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi important lah kan ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already dah pening kepala lah kan like very um you know so you you just got to doa for awhile rilek you know don't need to thin
err so in detail yet but at least to think okay now macam okay ah you know what is among all these things yang macam</malay
like you can because you think things that you can control macam budget photographer your brother ah these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of hantaran also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that ah if let's say for example ah we exchange err three saja lah item let's say for exampl
okay ah for example a'ah cuma satu I this one I don't know eh dulu I should have known luckily I never ah exchanged quran do you know that what is i
like uh okay so jada is common tapi seh jada kita tahu you will be used for um after marriage in when we play together but when talking about quran and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you hantar al quran</malay
you mean the hantaran</malay
oh duit that one that one is the mas eh ini not mas kan that one is err alah hantaran lah ya lah but some give cheque ah nowaday
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it lah ya if you ask me can be cheque kosong ha ha ha ha
cheque kosong what but inside is PayNow leh is direct transfe
ah so is all depends lah but again if follow tradition ya lah they want to see for real to sure masih cash you know you know bank not
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but mesti there's a transaction and PayNow
mm it happens ah actually happens during my time also is like oh because they only said lah when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so ah ya lah macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot tapi to know each other's partner is very very important so i
so I think like this uh family support is one factor very very important to me lah that's why err I mean culturally kita melayu is very united satu hati lah kan macam like kita you know lah we are lik
we always like um always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples susah even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also lah but the thing is like people also like sibuk and go and go and comment y
oh it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that tapi out there maybe dia pakai card card card tapi tak shar
per per per person or individual like that like macam tak tunjuk lah kan macam</malay
err like no communication with their families feel like tak tunjuk or what lah ya so that can happen tau macam</malay
tak tak tak ada then why you ask me after seven years dating pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke kan maybe all the while the guy only show up front oh aku ada hadiahkan best best you kno
ah dia bukan pun tak tunjuk kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging eh macam berlakon staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating ah but some people ya carry on maybe like for example dia partner no ah
the other party tu tak ada duit maybe tak you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe lah should be okay lah nanti kahwin pun okay lah macam sekarang</malay
um he has so many money aku minta pun okay jer ah you know sounds like but I the end when the person say oh uh he's in debt for the wedding ini ya actually that is not the only on
I think dari zaman our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P ramlee sho
ah lie lah borrow the chetty lah you know that that particular chetty will always just borrow lend the money to them what um high interest and then end up hutang because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family lah kalau family understand family tahu what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them wah very have good job then they get flat dengan with their pa
so there's uh about three months is like or four months ya tak start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
that's why he told me lah kan so like macam very kelakar then I was like abby you all gaji seventy eight thousand dah
then like let me oh mampus ah like that like that then he said no lah it's just tha
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like uh like macam peribahasa melayu apa the apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
ah tak tahu lah don't know lah there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that lah which I always think oh
to know you usually parents ah whether to let go kids to kahwin I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich lah right no need to be like so kaya or whatever you just need to have like um
ah more than enough like can start lah macam you can pay your bills you know you can you can uh you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
err want to want to buy a normal sayur or kangkung</malay
um when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my anak when all of you come to me my anak anak saudara ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision apakah your punya vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you nak make sure tha
you start something that with no hutang you know because basically you you start something with hutang you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know hutang lah kan you will have you got kids already hutang will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing lah ah because memang ah kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang ah kalau kita anak anak sultan johor ke daughters sultan daughters of sultan johor can lah
but the thing don't let it kill you lah that's why I said err in this case kan suka ke tidak instrinsic back breakdown tu kena ada</malay
ah introduce you must have really must have because if not lah if you ask me lah wah very jialat lah like every everything also must risau bu
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean kita tak boleh convince like that macam like for example ah you kno
fathers oh mesti nak ada lima ratus okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents ah okay lah boleh lah boleh lah sembarang ah he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point apa-apa suka hati okay lah korang dah plan kan okay okay tak apa</malay
ah engkau continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin
then after a while kan dia err
it got to a point that dia macam super nonsense
no but I um the the the first wife I don't know ah like apa motive dia buat macam gitu semua kan
dia nak apa revenge
so dia don't love the husband anymore
so dia just nak revenge only
I don't know that's where I'm confused about like whether dia fall in love with the colleague or
habis um so the guy love her or don't love her the guy like her or don't like her
then why the guy still jumpa with the shermaine and all
dia kan jumpa with the
the han so hee punya bapa
they meet and then after that err macam they the the guy the new guy share information with
ni wife punya bapa
the show is good you know the first few episodes was so good you know that I really want to watch I really want to keep watching and watching kan tapi after awhile
no it's not about the episodes it's about the way they run the show like the was so good ya the story line was so good tapi after awhile it's just so merepek
we watched that so many times and I still cry tu so sekarang I'm watching cerita reply nineteen ninety eight have you watched that
um ah there's dia ada reply nineteen ninety four reply nineteen ninety seven and reply nineteen ninety eh nineteen eighty eight
but no doubt ah princess hours macam is the best ever
ya I watched that bila I'm sec two when I was sec two sec one sec two

so after that she said macam okay ah let's do it lah just go national skin centre and then within three months kan the skin really clear up you know

your skin is lagi teruk

I use I do a lot of things back then macam one of those
plaster kan macam gini kan then in the middle is the white colour kan I will cut like macam

alam nyata ah

ya lah tu pasal tu pasal in real life tu tak ada pun
ada lah ada ada
ada ada ada ada there are people like this in real life
tak there are people you know this this is a real question there are people with superpowers in real life
and rasul
and para wali
even wali normal apa normal
pun ada power juga
ya consists superheroes apa
dah habis out of stock so sad
wallet yang tu lah yang the sometimes by designer tu I wanted the the the apa tu oh gosh oh dusty pink I swear I tell abang syafiq to buy fast
tengok oh but this one bulky
the one that I want is very apa tu very tipis dia boleh macam is literally wallet tau and then when you put the phone behind dia tak nampak bulky but cannot use with err cover I think
not phone casing bag lah it's a it's a wallet bag dia ada put phone belakang and it has chain chain strap
tapi tu bulky seh
I can't find any know macam like boring dia punya stroller semua macam like not the one that I want and they mostly is pre-order so that day I want to buy on the spot
abeh takleh ah abeh apa
ya so you open is really very nice actually I like the stroller then me and my friend kan keep on cari-cari like which one we want then finally we found this one is very nice but it's super expensive lah but it's okay lah one time beli
dia tak lightweight it's very berat it's like eleven
abeh lepas tu err I like thinking lah whether to get or not because at first
cause at first macam there's a there's other Nuna demi grow that we wanted but that one like besar gila and then but that one can put two people in two babies two babies
your head lah how can you sit ya you see you see tengok tengok show me ya that one that one the the tu a'ah cantik kan that's why you you see the video it's
cantik kan ah actually dia ada another one it's called Nuna Mixx ini Nuna Mixx next yang Nuna Mixx tu dia fold sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh shorten so dia macam dia compact err so yang ni yang baru ni dia compact and very
apa tu dia fold just nice ah and it can stand on its own and then dia boleh recline sampai ah lay very flat untuk baby baring ya and then dia punya
dia punya canopy boleh tarik sampai kat bawah the canopy the tu the cover ye lah bila dia tidur then like sunlight right either that or you ah you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
like no you use up to six months after that lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi
it's meant for something like that lah macam is heavy or probably the height or weight is not ah suitable untuk dorang anymore
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that macam kalau I want to take grab ke apa ke
because only grab can use uh if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat kalau you take taxi tak payah car seat
cik usop kan kawan abah cik usop ah what oh my god my toe sakit gila skit gila
tapi why seh why is it even swollen eh
no lah I scared lah cause that time I also sakit kaki again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the dia nya tu
how it works ya you will see how how dia punya tu works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the belakang the belakang is meshed is like macam like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part lepas tu when she baring kan belakang dia dia boleh rasa ah panas eh apa the air and then this one also boleh buat like bassinet bassinet
because bawah dia punya feet area kan you can just snap out dia punya feet area tu then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that lah
abeh lepas tu I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar sebab dia colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because dia boleh pusing and baby can face me instead
ya and then like let's say lah macam err apa I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down dia tepi dia ada net ada meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the barang to sampai next week I think about seven days
what baju mm mm
oh this is the baju you say you wanted to pakai eh wanted to buy and then scared dia tak sampai on time
hais so many things oh I want to give away a lot of bags away those tu semua kat dalam box tu I don't know nak tengok ah bag aku yang nak giveaway how to do work like this haiyo
a'ah seh dia dah half lah
and then washing machine pun belum habis the washing machine haven't finish ah so many things to do need dia ada dryer kat dalam dia but ya dryer dia is not is not ah drying lah tapi nak kena like ya it's damp so you you still have to like you still have to sangkut sidai outside
outside ah but it's now raining so I think I'm just gonna put it here then maybe kalau balik rumah jurong I will just bring bring along kalau macam I stay lama ah
ah ya tapi eh tapi ni tak boleh masuk banyak kalau dia nak kalau dia nak basuh like like everyday dia basuh like dua tiga kalau jeans jeans susah ah
tapi laundry mat it's okay lah just get laundry mat lah better what can wash all satu kali ni wash dua tiga kali nak kena wash seh as in cause banyak kan so kalau baju baby okay ah baju baby
is very little and small so I will just dump everything masuk dalam tapi bila drying dia kan it's sikit sebab dia punya drying is dalam basket kecil tu you have to keep inside that basket kecil then kalau letak banyak-banyak it won't kering
I mean it's good cause kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan ya socks underwears all the small small ah ni lah T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see ah if he even if he wash this one right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to cuci to dry satu kali and is more saving lah dari dia pergi pergi bawah then washing machine and then after that you know oh no cuci is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash kat sini kat dalam washing machine ni
uniform tak boleh masuk ni busy uniform masuk dalam ni ada ah just have to search ada ada but masalahnya dia nak angkat benda tu ah pergi toilet everytime
orh okay lah ya he can there's there's a slightly bigger one like like maybe double the size of that ya tengok ah dekat lazada ke shopee ke ah no lah ezbuy don't want ezbuy lambat sampai tak habis-habis seh
I mean shopee sells everything oh you know semalam kelakar abang boy called me
he said that his shopee nya barang delivered tapi tak sampai cause he find cannot find the barang so so I said to him lah you contact the seller lah and say mm that the barang tak sampai then after that ah then I fikir balik confirm he he don't know how to do all these lah kan maksudnya never mind lah you give me what's the items yang missing and then your home address ah
lepas tu he he already give me everything then after that he call me again he say takpe zurah dah dah jumpa mak buang kat dalam storeroom because because mak thought it's sampah because it comes in a plastic yang macam ya so mak thought it's sampah nasib baik mak belum buang he just dump she just dump it inside the storeroom abeh the funny thing is arrisa tak
cakap dengan mak is is barang ni tau don't know ah maybe ah cause mak ambil buat masuk agaknya then arrisa also
it's either that or it's either that or the dia macam ah saw it saw it somewhere lah
it's funny then after that I arrisa also laugh I heard over the phone lah kelakar gila mmhmm then mak ingat sampah
nasib baik tak terbuang baju baby seh I think she bought baju baby
I told her go shopee buy all the stuff don't buy me then actually on that day yang datang sana I wanted to show her macam mana nak pakai so busy and all that nasib baik ibu dah tunjuk dia
then abang boy macam like ah pening kepala cause she will start buying stuff I say it's okay lah it's still cheap seh rather than you want to go kiddy palace so expensive
I don't know mana tahu
then you think my back not sakit meh sit like this no because my kaki is sakit that's why macam duduk gini I think I'm gonna feel the same thing like that time apa the my left my left thigh sakit so I need to
because dia macam tangkap belakang I don't know ah but it's so sakit like and now it's not so bad yang that time nya really very bad it's so painful
ya let's hope I put cream esok malam ni nak nak urut lagi
tu ah
now she take lesser naps tau macam she can stay awake for longer time cause she's like almost two months already I can chill I can chill
mm the other night I didn't I didn't I I lambat change her ni kan change her diaper wah she melalak like kena pukul seh she rimas
aura after this we mandi okay after this can go mandi lah can go mandi lah correct

she wants to stay awake dah nak tertidur dah
eh sakit seh I think really ah my leg no no no my toe my toe my toe not my leg

then I like see because macam macam dia still small seh abeh lepas tu kasi hundred fifty I feel like macam
tummy dia not that big what that time kasi ninety dah muntah-muntah aku kalau kasi semalam macam buat hundred twenty she never even finish she drink like fifty jer
that's why I say hundred fifty is the current it's the now right now nak kena buat hundred fifty then hundred twenty pun dia tak tak minum habis macam mana
first month pun kita kasi ninety jer tak kasi hundred twenty ya that one I know dia boleh reach that kind until that amount
ya because I'm worried that it's too much for her but then when I read the ikut the tin punya instructions eh because ah this week eh next week wait ah two more days she'll be eight weeks already so eight to twelve weeks is hundred fifty then I like shock seh macam huh why skip hundred twenty then suddenly hundred fifty apa seh
hundred twenty ah so now cause last time when she drink dia tak tak minum banyak kan macam dia tak habis ninety right I will start doing sixty so now if dia tak habis hundred twenty I will do ninety cause she has to increase apa she cannot stay sixty ninety she needs to go up to ninety hundred twenty okay we gonna drink like that untuk you okay

yesterday there's ada satu interview eh recruiter kan
what's the word ah macam
like you know like you ask them to call back kan abeh dia cakap ah no only two minutes macam a bit annoying ah you know
orang melayu cakap um jangan apa
most of the job dia orang cakap aiya it's like contract it's not really ah
that is that makes sense what kalau tak nobody will also macam
full time but because sekarang kan I teach tuition kan
no but tuition only left lagi dua bulan ah until um october kan O level atau N level kan
last week I just start um this new student ah budak melayu ah budak apa N level ah N level dekat bukit batok
no I think now they they make more centres ah I think they I think dia orang there's no way they can do in a big hall what kan
then yang students yang lain all pergi normal classroom ah
I think same time ah the the whole singapore mesti same time what kalau tak later how to know that you know
I think part time got got a a lot job ah macam yang this um
kat mana eh um
for part time mesti commit
for me best is um data analsyt atau business analyst
atau system analyst ah
kena twenty four seven support
it's like like to me not much difference right kalau work from home then
I think python macam python for me is okay lah because it's a
actually high level is the the code that macam can be readable kan so kalau macam if a human being baca the code
ah there's this code thing called fortran right betul tak
then what ni apa this there's this language namanya C hash eh apa C hash eh is it
but it's um the pace is what like dia ikut which um which language
I don't really like to like build you know macam build all the app
ingat tak um during the year twenty
my job mostly like ah then investigate ah gitu
ah error error dia akan email kan so times ten kan times ten
like macam need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
like enriching to do this kind of work but yang tak suka is the I really benci is support twenty four seven on the phone ah
the like not say down time ah macam
nenek boleh pergi balik ah nenek
um I think tak boleh ah but eh but dia right yang syakilah iman is maybe ah I think
eh I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think berlambak ah mail dia
no ah oh auntie I always just say cik cik rozi ah cakap something ah
then dah you all dah makan belum
semua tengah tidur kan
tak dia punya ingredients kan beli kat pasar atau uh
you mean the ikan is the the one that is boneless eh
um mesti
ya the sauce right then pour on top kan just just tuang
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make ah macam mix and match
apa apa ya like
tomato semua ah tomato um pineapple
ah capsicum sedap I like I like the capsicum
the yang makan masa ah kan
for for us actually if let's say our our family kan macam nak ada maid kan
kalau siapa dah kahwin kan atau like we have our own house kan maybe separate ah let's say I
no I mean like one maid ah because like the maid tak payah just stay at one house do all the work what because sometimes mak ada nenek ada kan so maybe can
the maid is okay then we we must bayar for the transport
and maybe give them time off ah kan kalau
tak complain atau tak
feel macam pressure kan we we like they call it give and take ah
don't over over work the maid lah kalau maid is okay then okay what you know
this one maybe we can plan ten ah next time because bapak kan dah tua<malay kan nanti mak
like at least like the maid boleh masakkan actually the best kan the maid masak
right because if the maid masak right then we just need to buy the stuff ah then sekarang
tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh just order online kan
but any online pasar or not macam pasar food eh buy meat or chicken ada eh
but I mean like the betul punya pasar online maybe maybe
no because fairprice jual beef tak eh because beef is very hard to find right
um macam mana the person tahu
oh no oh but means the device kan then the the user mesti jalan to
our our house all small what america everything is so big kan I mean america everything you see dia punya rumah besar-besar or I think european some also the house big kan
but the device is uh quite mahal kan I think thousands right
so seven days tak payah pergi kerja ah just somewhere else ah
itu hari cakap open the ikea but oh but now open lah
so nobody can meet their friends to eat what so they just have to eat cepat-cepat makan then then just balik class ah
but that that time weird you know ah dekat mana eh
apa nama kedai dia yang mister you you know orchid house dekat serangoon gardens tu
orchid house the the indian food macam mamak ah
mamak food
al-azhar gitu those kind macam woodgrove gitu ah
phase the first week of phase two kan atau I think I jumpa my friend during the phase two second week ah kan
phase two is about nineteen june kan so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend makan dekat tu ah orchid house
pelik ke so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird ah kan
mesti customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else kan because
because of the apa seating arrangement
and some people they apa like they in a group kan say eight people ah four four kan
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then bersembang lah dengan kawan-kawan kan
um I heard the store owner kan atau business owner dia orang call the
but sometimes we think oh it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you tengok news
eh but do do you think it's possible kan kalau dia orang make a system kan means by far away then they auto checkout
ah if the person off then tak boleh ah kan
ya the the app apa what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
it's good kan macam but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
actually that one bagus tau pasal you like eh hey google then the you can play spotify
K because my my friend he dia pakai google home eh google phone tau so I use apple ah but the that time I stay punggol also share with him kan
so he use the the what google assistance eh yang cakap the voice ah
dia cakap even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
ah macam macam mana nak tahu ah
no I mean macam mana nak nak tahu that whether they are listening to you or not
no I think if let's say oh but I think google kan macam mana eh if you like ask question kan like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say um oh sorry we cannot
something basic ah like uh what time is it maybe dia tahu ah kalau tanya something like um
my friend eh my friend singaporean kan but then he dia study full time dekat pergi luar ah
then dia punya apartment kan
then dia pun ada alexa I think now alexa better ah because
I think that one bukan maybe that one is it thailand something ah I cannot remember
ah the ah the dekat mana eh ah this place ah that time I went interview tanjong pagar go it's called what guoco tower ah
so when you tap kan dia dia tahu which which place to go to ah like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down what
kaunye favourite drama apa
boleh macam-macam ah I mean you can go korea korean drama
actually aku tak tahu like legit
eh tapi I mean like you always tengok ni apa
so what you macam you punya favourite drama
oh jadi kau most of the time tengok yang variety show ah
aku rasa is tujuh hari
okay apa cerita dia
bedek ah
aku sekolah then
ah yes kita semua more of like
itu actually rabak gila seh
betul betul I mean kita tengok
kita selalu tengok I think YouTube
yes ada dia punya timing serious gila
that's my macam go to err
it's the it's the only time that I baca surat khabar
a'ah betul kau habis cerita kau
aku kat tepi tengok aje dah habis belum
langgar tak timing dia
thailand drama not for me I mean aku tak tengok sangat thailand drama
yang macam comedy movie because they quite funny ah
aku tahu lah I mean
so obvious cam dia ada adam apple and
ada like they very tall for guys dia punya features macam very tall then very rough hands
that's macam
dia punya telltale sign ah
now now because of surgery also susah nak apa tu nak err nak bezakan lelaki ngan perempuan you can lacking of open you know you know
oh ya actually aku tengok juga kat Facebook that one oh my god like really look like ya really look like a woman
that that's the dangerous part kau imagine eh kau imagine macam
uh aku tak tahu aku bawa balik ni
uh oh my god aku tak boleh imagine aku tak boleh kau imagine reaction ayah ngan mak
tapi long distance relationship apa
dia kat singapore abeh perempuan tu kat malaysia
so they just communicate by ni ah cam telephone ah like just call
boring pe kalau tak nampak
ya long distance relationship susah
tak ah I mean I got see like couple of my friends macam they take uh long distance relationship kan then it never work out
tak lah banyak perempuan tinggalkan lelaki
a'ah legit kau tengok ah boys to men kan
it's not a norm tapi macam it's a thing
I don't know the period ah I mean dua tahun apa I's quite long dua tahun
like you nowadays very susah ah nak dapat
ah dapat yang baik
more of like a kampung kampung area I mean that's quite good
kalau future wife I will look for if she macam religious
ah religious um pandai masak
pandai masak is important yes I know I know you I know you don't know how to cook but it's a fact kakak you nak kena tengok dia punya
oh ada banyak lah I mean um looks looks kalau looks wise kan aku tak macam
tak tak kesah sangat ah boleh cakap
ya I mean looks nowadays kan kau tengok eh looks doesn't matter lah for me looks doesn't matter but most of the time guys go for looks ah which pada aku is just uh
which pada aku is just uh not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to macam
bukan aku cakap not all aku tak cakap yang all beautiful ladies
perempuan lawa is basically jahat ah tapi
kalau katakan eh like ninety per cent
kalau from my point of view lah aku tengok dia ni lawa tapi oh dia buat kawan aku macam gini oh
it give you macam a thought ah macam so perempuan lawa macam gini ah
like my like nowadays it's more of kita judge the book by its cover kan
I mean you can judge a person based on dia punya personality first tapi sekarang most of the time they judge on looks
just because dia tak lawa eh dia ni macam gini ah dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu
last time is more macam they understand each other like
macam mak ngan ayah punya time is more ah wah aku suka dia K eh she's the one for me macam gitu like
like last time people is more of a macam loyal tau sekarang is more of K ah
ya attention kalau nak cakapkan they need attention ah
because now is kita living in a modern society tau so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with faham
tu pasal ah
that's why they need attention as like macam uh pleasure
not uh pleasure ah macam how to say ah
kalau married couple for me kalau nak attention is very hard ah
tapi kalau nak cakap kan eh um
aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku attention tapi kita ah macam you're not ah giving both
kau nak selalu cakap I need attention tapi you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things apa
no ah kalau nak cakapkan piece together all of it kan is susah juga pasal
sekarang is more like kita have different thoughts different feelings kita punya emotions all jumble up
jadi kita ah
and singapore eh kalau kau nak tahu eh singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world tau serious
because of the stress that macam kita put on ourselves just to survive every month
and singapore eh have the macam the highest divorce rate
mostly melayu lah tapi
it's very hard lah because nowadays more of like dia orang um
dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan tau
they fikir okay macam orang putih cakap yolo eh
you only live once kan so they never think macam ah beyond horizon tau
dorang just fikir okay uh aku nak party ah all the way but dia nak kena fikir juga
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going macam downhill ah
so pada aku wise eh nak cakap sekarang punya zaman is more stress lah basically
tapi yang penting eh daripada drama boleh pergi marriage
I mean like is like macam uh a playhouse tau
kau boleh buat mistake tapi kau boleh buat mistake tapi it's uh it's scripted ya it can be soft because you're in the playhouse kan
aku ada tu aku ada tu thought tau eh what if I were to become this guy this rich guy
what if I apa kata kalau aku jadi dia ni aku jadi dia tu
macam oh but it's not going to happen ah it's just that kau ada dia punya thought ah tapi end up macam kau face reality ah basically susah gila
kalau nak cakapkan drama
drama is okay cakap-cakap scripted kan
tapi aku lebih suka macam reality show
kau suka variety show variety show is most likely buat macam games talkshow api aku lebih suka macam aku tak tahu ah kalau kau tengok shark tank
it's about macam got an entrepreneur tau
entrepreneur apa pula eh
oh uh macam kau businessman
kau businessman so kau nak jual kau punya idea
ask people to support you lah macam gitu beyond this five people ah
I mean these five people at the end will uh will macam cakap ah okay aku akan sponsor kau kalau tak semua cakap big no ah
ah one of them can sponsor you two of them can sponsor jadi it depends ah on idea bagus tak
it's not voting basically macam kau datang sana kau ada idea okay kau nak orang tolong kau pasal this five people they are very uh
uh their influence is big tau and their market is big also jadi kalau kau amik dengan dia orang kan you will gain a lot
jadi that's why they a lot of people go there actually tapi that's why I like reality show it's not scripted
bondi rescue apa
kau jadi lifeguard
macam ni eh bay watch
so basically kau suka more of like cerita yang berkenaan dengan
kalau in-laws bukan adik ipar itu mertua
um brother in-law abang ipar
oh my melayu
so by the time the lifeguard actually masuk laut tu balik kan this couple dah face down
lemas ah drowning ah
abeh lifeguard tu macam sedih ah macam eh
tapi it's not their fault apa they they it's their job it's their job tapi
kadang-kadang it's not meant to be ah it's not meant to be
it's macam aku boleh cakap kan this world eh is scripted
macam K you cannot predict this one you cannot predict that one but like only god know lah macam
tuhan aje tahu when is your ajal when is your this one when is your that one
so you cannot predict ah if they are meant to die that means K ah mungkin diorang pergi somewhere better lah
oh macam err
it's ah macam mouth to mouth ah
oh that penat gila actually that one is very penat
diorang try to keep their emotion macam in check ah
it's like macam kau tahu cerita yang dulu kita masuk adam khoo workshop
pasal seratus orang dalam trap dalam bottle
abeh diorang work together just to save this one person's life
it's yang diorang actually got no where to go tapi dah ada this high macam it's a escape route escape route eh
so diorang ah cakap okay that means mungkin korang satu orang pergi keluar panggil orang datang
so diorang panggil budak ni ah budak ni pasal
it's not pasal ringan he's the
it's budak kan they they are all adults ah
kan is they kesiankan K so they so okay kau pergi panggil orang tolong kita I think about seratus orang gitu ah they all stack onto one another
then uh pangku yang budak tu ke atas then
then diorang pergi dia dapat escape ah budak tu
abeh bila dia datang balik dengan pertolongan eh it's too late
like the ninety nine people dekat botol tu kan died
that's macam gitu lah
they cannot save ya they cannot save everyone but it's great ah macam diorangnya job
guilty conscience ah betul
tak salah north depan south belakang
east kanan west kiri
oh dia cari bapa dia
oh yang couple tu eh
so end up end up dia tak save ah yang
kak cakaplah board board

pasal kadang-kadang orang suka tengok ngaji tengok ngaji jer you know what I mean umi kalau nak umi tak nak kalau selain melainkan kalau umi dato aliff ke dato vida nak tunjuk kehidupan takde orang kisah pasal umi kehidupan
so kalau umi nak buat channel umi buat satu satu topic tu satu niche umi boleh buat macam kesihatan ada orang buat macam err buat duit anything lah okay lah okay contoh eh contoh contoh let's just pakai contoh orang lain
okay um kita tengok channel channel orang lain eh kita tengok berapa banyak dia buat okay contoh um channel siapa siapa yang ustaz ustaz apa ustaz kazim

okay lapan ratus enam puluh satu ribu kan subscriber
okay okay lah ni ni anggaran jer dia buat dalam three point two K per month okay tapi the thing is benda ni kadang-kadang dia anggarkan jer it might not be true macam sometimes dia boleh buat lagi banyak lah you don't know okay lah let's tengok macam channel um celebrity eh
siapa ah siapa yang buat channel err okay lah aliff aliff syukri okay dia suka buat youtube kan

okay dia dia punya video banyak okay tengok eh dia punya langganan langganan berapa okay satu point empat satu juta okay dia punya upload dah seribu lebih ah video dia dia dia naik kan okay um and then dia punya view dah banyak dia tiga ratus lebih pasal dato aliff ni dulu dia bila dia start tak banyak orang tengok lama-lama kan banyak orang tengok jadi
okay dia daripada malaysia okay um dia punya okay estimated dia punya anggaran dia sepuluh ribu lebih okay
ya sebulan yes so kalau convert sana tiga puluh ribu ya ringgit lah tiga puluh ribu ringgit so this is
I mean ni bukan dia punya ni salah satu stream untuk salah satu apa tu dia punya periuk nasi ni bukan dia punya main source dia ada business dia this is just untuk marketing jer buat this is channel is untuk marketing dia okay
umi buat ngaji lah I'm doing this I'm doing this for your ngaji no lah remember I take video for your masak that one I haven't upload yet
that one is okay kalau kalau masak boleh taruh lah cuma um tak kalau nak ramai orang tengok I don't know lah maybe like very slow lah kalau nak cepat tak boleh cepat lah kena macam perlahan-perlahan upload upload lama-lama they will increase dia punya views
pasal sekarang kan umi nak buat kan untuk umi ngaji that's why suruh umi buat ngaji punya you ajar tajwid like macam satu video tu dua tiga minute you berbual pasal qalqalah
qalqalah then you give like contoh ayat
okay then you okay ni episodenya okay ni dah okay ni lepas qalqalah you cakap maybe hukum lain lah I don't know hukum lain untuk tajwid okay episode ni dah berakhir kita jumpa lagi pada episode seterusnya gitu something like that um
ya but kalau umi buat ni umi kena consistent lah umi tak boleh buat macam
ngaji okay kalau umi nak orang orang tengok umi kan orang kena macam cari umi punya channel pasal umi nak belajar sesuatu dulu kalau umi dah misal kata umi dah banyak buat video nanti kalau umi nak ngaji later later boleh ah tapi sekarang I think better you buat macam video yang
um boleh
boleh juga tapi ngaji um
kalau umi belajar tajwid is tajwid is better lah
lagi bagus umi boleh ajar tajwid dulu ngaji nanti lah nanti because ngaji you know banyak orang lain pun boleh ngaji kan I mean it's on they got all the sheikh sheikh all to ngaji whatever then ngaji can can but not now lah now we focus on your tajwid first or your iqra
ya boleh mm ajar tajwid then maybe umi boleh also ada lagi satu series untuk orang yang baru baru nak mengaji ajar iqra macam ajar dia apa huruf huruf hijayyiyah all that

dua puluh bermakna umi takde gaji kan umi tahu kenapa
ya lah tiap-tiap dua puluh hari bulan untuk bulan lepas punya kan misal kata ni dua puluh october kan untuk bayar bulan september punya tapi umi september belum start pe
jadi mungkin dia akan bayar umi bulan depan bulan depan dua puluh november
ya biasa umi tengok lah nanti kalau umi dapat dua puluh dapat duit ke tak pasti ah
but macam mana you terkeluar Zoom
okay tak apa I I ajar you macam mana nak pakai Zoom dulu cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
okay lepas tu kena sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I punya sign in is just under sign in with tapi kalau you punya personal I would think you have to um sign in pakai
your own email lah tak okay but let's just pretend macam you ada your own email okay
okay so like selalunya when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will macam send you a link kan then like from from the link you you just
select you can see like my background kat sini kan you it's apa um it's virtual screen so maknanya my background takleh nampak lah
kalau kalau messy kalau
so you can change like your virtual background ah at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I selalu pakai virtual background cause belakang messy kan so I don't want to like show my background so kalau it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
tak ni dah log in dah
so uh you can also add in your own photo so for me I macam I create I even created my own background just to
bagi lawa lah so I I use this
tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni kan it's
so background is done and then um apa lagi nak tahu
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet dengan iPad I think ah ya
I'm not sure about um apa not android apa nama dia Windows punya laptop but
so kalau I pakai desktop kan
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp punya web
ya but if I pakai if I choose the Google chrome punya kan
so even kalau macam I tengah pakai Google chrome lepas tu I open WhatsApp web
dia tak akan nampak I punya WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome punya err window
so like this would be hard macam uh once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just um
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know selalu macam
you selalu cakap then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper orang boleh dengar
and then it goes the same for the video lah kalau your video takde they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me dalam class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
ni lah
tak yang tunjuk you tadi
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad dia akan tanya kalau you nak err apa
macam for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers tadi um
so even kalau even kalau dia
so kalau you pakai video kan
uh apa nama dia
actually you can see yourself lah kat tepi
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are apa the video is done I mean the video is off
apa done
and then other basic things is like macam
raise up your hands or err apa
okay I don't really have it oh dengan yes no
okay so they will just ask oh ah who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just angkat tangan
tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini lah
apa rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
so record is just you boleh tengok balik lah the recording
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record macam macam that time I conduct my master classes right
macam movie gitu
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then susah lah
ya then lepas tu I just um I tried out uh record on cloud
then orang akan just
ya orang akan be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
chat ah okay cause ni tak ada participants sekarang kan so
mm then you know you can change err to everyone ataupun to a specific person
mm tak boleh
tapi kan ada orang cakap yang like what like the host who
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer kat dalam kelas lah ya
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message kan you have to make sure yang apa you you click back to everyone
tapi kan sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages uh your and messages apa to everyone
ya so you just have to macam baca betul-betul lah like which one is everyone which one is to you only
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to apa to to my friend ah
breakout rooms is just uh macam tadi you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of macam
lepas tu orang tu nak breakout into smaller groups to do group work
macam create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant bila I tengah tengah tengok
cause for adults I don't think you guys pakai much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks apa
ya so if you like uh if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say macam I conduct my fundraising master classes kan the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
mm I think it's better than apa what's the other option the outlook is it live live
but it's so susah just now
no but like but like what was your apa what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room ada virtual
I tak
I tak pernah pergi lah but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
cakap lah
apa it's the starting of the
I mean technically it's in the poem also what so like even if you baca like
but this is done by the escape room punya punya company lah
oh so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator macam team bonding facilitator right
cause cause got my for my global studies punya apa
no it's like macam okay basically if it's physical kan in school then they will give you like nearing to exams lah macam your apa midterms or your final year then they will give you like err a literal goody bag
then inside macam ada foolscap ada snacks ada like ya then like all these are like
err apa get
promote ah sponsorship ah sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship lah but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty punya goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small apa faculty group kan
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but um is to try out our apa
um room punya fee
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run dulu lah
tak tak tak kita play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you nak orang uh you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want what kan ya
you have to source out for the for the people lah but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android punya phone
and then cause at first they tried to apa
E-vouchers for apa three different three different categories macam welfare eh welfare pula beauty uh food and macam activities lah like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end macam I think they just decided
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to macam we tried to
apa delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships tak reply cause COVID sekarang then even their organisations not doing well apa the companies not doing well
like even like activity punya entertainment places pun tak not
ya then now I just finished my fundraising punya series oh
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first macam kita
we just like no confidence ah macam it's so susah
uh members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism lah he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also macam donate in bulks what like you and mama
seventy per cent seventy per cent pula seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot what
just you sorang jer
apa embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think macam is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that one a bit but in the end err a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class macam it's not that bad lah ya
cause it was still macam ramai then she was like oh my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like oh ha ha ha nasib baik cause there's only like
three people yang sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people yang sign up
from the faculty punya group
oh at first he I don't really know him but I just tahu pasal he lives in my for
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance macam I saw his uh
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time pasal
ah this excel course lah pastu I macam and I wanted to join that time tapi I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
I was dengan tengah planning for this fundraising I was thinking like hmm like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought macam I think
err apa
not hands-on macam very practical skills that people would need macam in their workplaces in their school right
he was just like ya sure sure lepas tu I I went to find out err he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like oh my god so kesian then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
dah I told him already but
two and half cause the maximum kita anuh is
actually I don't even know what's abang doing
like what what what did he macam in the end
oh bukan as in what is he selling like what kan dia
oh macam
macam GrabFood lah
so it's it's just plain rice chicken dengan just different sauce
mana seh
I don't know I just go novena untuk err skin centre
ya but the soft launch abang nak buat apa
but it's a a like you know like stall in in a food court ke in a
in a shopping mall ke
okay lah like atas atas punya food court cause I heard like there's apa
err pasal it's this semester is all online kan I didn't even step in school like for one moment
err go back to school to study apa
no at first cannot sekarang dah boleh
but jauh
you boleh tampines hub is the most not conducive environment ever
it's so bising you ever went there before
it's so bising like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay lah understand but like
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside yang kat atas semua it's so hard
but like two hours macam so sikit if I want to study there
ya and then nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun
some establishments macam Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
tapi it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam err my job punya module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to cam use all these
your laptop semua kan
even if you have friends macam
paiseh kan nak tanya
so it's usually like like apa a combination of err topics
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought macam lebih lebih bagus ah
uh non exam modules and two exams pastu I macam happy lah yay three three modules no exam
ah ambil kau semua submission at the same time cause usually
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually lah err the macam apa submission the deadline is
tak tahu kenapa lah but it's just like that ah
but the assignment like most of my assignments here um especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating nya assignment
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy punya mod
my major apa
so you you bayangkan I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
semua yes you see
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same sama-sama
macam now
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you tak percaya you tanya kak shima the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just belajar for that one
uh like you belajar for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
I just got my I just go my apa
twenty third november baru end
then cause different assignments is different weightages apa
like like I think it's cause macam they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
mesti I macam huh
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we dapat results you macam
lagi cepat stress
you naik year three year four it gets harder and harder what you have to take harder modules kan
I just want to macam freeze my lah so that it won't macam tak turun tak naik I mean I mean naik is possible it's very hard for you to naik lah honestly
ya tak turun lah basically
dorang nak tunggu vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already lah but unfortunately tak ada vaccine
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round punya dah actually dah tutup
but then they just buka balik then they said oh it's until oh it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so macam tak kira kalau you ada you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
my major punya requirement is that
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like macam group work
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out lah I tak boleh pergi lah
mm so sem one but my course my my major ada this requirement that you kena ambil this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so kalau you miss out in sem one tak boleh ambil in sem two jer tau
two uh apa different modules from two different universities
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a macam group work gitu ya
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with um just like err apa nama dia
uh doing online kalau boleh
if you are apa namanya I lost my train of thoughts already ayah keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling pula it's actually trying to like
take two different err from two different schools macam macam mana you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
I don't really have hope yang kita akan pergi lah cause it's ya it's quite hard
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is macam tak baik lah like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
no kalau kalau
kalau one kalau one year then I won't lah like no and and it's not just them it's like
the faculty I mean my major macam just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but the the new application yang dorang kasi it's more
apa there's more options ah
kena submit lagi ah
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject apa and you and you won't
you've been looking forward to this but nasib baik I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what takde
know like kak shima stay in the hall everything
what it what people are mad about is like macam the the college tak
they don't they don't dia tak relay apa-apa
only after two weeks they reported baru ada like
the laki lah
it took two weeks just to macam do something then that speaks a lot what
jap eh ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni
jap jap and then after that like they and then we were like
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know macam sensation lah like the media just wants to like keep on uh saying oh again
no but but in but kita punya people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
a bit penat
tak I mean like sometimes the
if someone is busuk and then like
I mean you think like the person tak mandi like is poor or what macam
abeh kalau orang tu uh
hang out dengan

okay dah dah
hi uh my name is rismah I'm eighteen years old this year and my birthday is coming so tolonglah belikan present ke apa ke
err lagi err
kebanyakan buah lah sebab err cause I like mango and
oval kot
ada yang oval ada yang bulat tergantung ah
tergantung buah dia nak grow macam mana
uh itu jer
itu jer kot sebab
betul lah kata err abang saya ini dia
ada yang bengkok ada yang straight
ada juga mango yang panjang kalau kau orang pernah nampak lah but then
itu jer
sebab mango ini kan it's very very sweet and
jangan cakaplah bila okay ah kadang uh nak makan mango ini ada kalau kau orang pernah lah
err kadang ada yang tersangkut dekat gigi lah
ada yang terselit dekat sana sini lah sebab kan dia orang punya apa itu
cause mango pun dia punya biji dia ada macam tali
so nanti dia orang terstuck dekat gigi ke apa ke but
other than that macam it's really really sweet and okay kalau kau orang nak tahu
cakap tadi yang ada colour
apa oren lah hijau lah merah lah kalau korang nak tahu um hijau is mango um mangga muda
um means uh mango yang masih belum masak lah and if you want to know the sweetest mango is the red mango
ah kalau kau orang nampak red mango itu lah mango paling sedap dalam dunia
so kenapa dia favourite sebab mango they're just relaxing they just
dia macam very juicy boleh buat juice and
oh banyak pun ada giant pun ada
ah cold storage pun banyak so
but macam macam ah nak cari mango ini dekat dingapore memang senang gila
so um jangan jangan apa
err pergi try lah I mean pergi try makan mango kalau siapa siapa yang tak suka makan mango pergi try confirm akan tambah lagi
mesti ada confirm because
so people will confirm keluarkan product product mango um like lip balm ke yang rasa mango
atau lipstick yang rasa mango kita mana tahu kan betul tak
lagi um
lagi err apa
mesti lah
mesti ada macam bingsu ada flavour mango
habis lepas itu um recently my friend bawa kan uh I
apa eh um I think it's a mango float I uh they call it mango float
so dalam pun ada mango and
every single dessert eh confirm for me ada mango punya
sebab kalau tak ada mango tak sah that's me okay kalau tak ada mango tak sah mesti ada mango punya kalau
tak ada mango tak nak makan
kan betul tak
ada diabetes uh diabetes ke it's also good for their health tahu kalau dia orang nak makan mango pun
sebab it's a fruit it's bukan makanan manis it's not too sweet it's not too bitter so
boleh uh mango ni boleh dimakan dari segi um budak dari budak budak sampai lah ke orang tua
and ya like I said it's very very healthy so kalau boleh kau orang makan lah mango and
mango ni colour dia yellow tahu colour dia unique gila and
colour dia is macam matahari macam apa
apa word itu um macam um apa menyinari eh apa
uh ah like macam dia just
and bila kalau um like my brother said ada mango mango tea eh
kalau telan itu fulamak dekat dalam tekak boleh rasa sampai dekat dalam badan it's really really really refreshing guys so kau orang kena try mango kalau kau orang tak pernah try
um recipe eh recipe mungkin um I tak tahu eh
tapi um
siapa siapa tahu buat mango juice senang gila just pecah-pecahkan mango
ah letak ice and letak air sikit dah jadi mango juice
so that's adalah err itu adalah satu ah recipe yang kau orang boleh try
um tak tahu nama dia mango apa lah terserah kan kau orang lah nak namakan apa tapi mango itu macam mango juice sedap gila
apa lagi eh err atau tak nak buat mango cake
tak pernah ada orang buat mango cake
boleh letak mango buah-buah dia semua
um hias cantik-cantik err colour pun kuning sama macam mango
atau chef chef yang dekat luar sana yang tahu buat mango cake ah bentuk dia betul-betul macam mango dia punya texture dia design dia semua ah pun boleh juga
oh kau orang pernah try mango puff
mango puff pun ada dia orang jual dekat um
maybe polar ke dekat um
prima deli ke
there's um cakap pasal recipe
uh and berbual pasal cakes and stuff I think um
kau kalau kau orang yang dengar macam lapar juga eh
I tak tahu lah recipe apa yang ada untuk mango tapi um
mango tak ada recipe lah like you can do whatever you want with mango you can smash it you can just eat it
and bukan makanan jer yang dia orang keluarkan dia orang keluarkan syrup juga
betul tak I mean like they uh they they they
untuk like special ah special occasions ke atau like special events ke atau tak
it's just so nice that macam like
err like we love mango everyday we eat mango tapi
so bila
I also macam like
oh dengan mango mango eh oh banyak sekali um
after you keluarkan from the freezer
I just tak tahu ah macam suka sangat lah err mango yang it's very very cold so
bila telan kan when I eat this mango right when it's cold
I just feel so so so refreshed macam tekak ini sejuk gila especially when it's during hot days like sunny days
cooling mango oh my god it's just refreshing so much betul tak
lagi-lagi when
really really really really satisfying you know macam
bila tengah berpeluh eh tengah like
just finished err doing some activities with your families dekat park ke and everything then this
err ice cream seller tiba-tiba datang and then jual you ice cream and then you bought this you buy this uh ice cream punya eh um mango ice cream
then you telan during these summer days
tengok my accent pun dah jadi woo macam sebab dah sedap sangat dalam otak ini walaupun tak makan
I pun tak tahu so because
kalau dekat sekolah ada kerja I'm just going to do it
but when dekat rumah macam tiba-tiba nak
like cause mostly kita kan kita semua ada practical kita semua ada theory
and kalau kat sekolah ada practical I will always do it and kalau dekat rumah ah like he said home based learning
kalau ada theory
I'm just going to revise ah if tak then I'm just going to listen to whatever
cikgu explain ke or
other subjects ke other topics I'm just going to listen
but other than that I think kalau dekat sekolah I'm productive kot because mostly I'm doing
tak pernah malas ah tak tak pernah sekali malas ah
malas pun kalau dah penat kalau dah shag gila
tapi um my last meal
entah I I I I come back
jangan cakap lah eh I think my favourite food for now it's um chicken chop
black pepper dia orang is just
ada rasa lah like confirm ada rasa punya lah macam
tak boleh describe ah sebab sedap sangat you know macam nak makan sekarang juga you know something like that have you ever felt like that way when you talk about your favourite food and then you feel like you're hungry right now
betul-betul gila I mean like
kita macam tak berbual pasal makan pun we're still hungry
apa lagi kalau tengok kalau tengah tengah penat eh habis tengah lapar habis scroll instagram
oh my god macam dah itu tak apa sedap pula itu and
lagipun it's very rare for us to find in singapore so
hais buat lapar jer
I don't know if you guys tahu ke tak syafiq kyle
he's a malaysian um actor and dia pernah main dekat cerita nur
as dalam dekat cerita nur ini
dia main sebagai um
as an ustad
dia baru balik jordan for um untuk apa
err mengetahui lagi uh lebih lanjut dia punya pengetahuan sebagai ustad lah like
he wants to become an ustad you know because his family is really really pious well he came from a pious family
with a what do you call pelacur
dia nak cari err apa
dia nak cari err
so I think this cerita boleh you know
dari cerita nur because cerita nur is mostly all about err religious yang
siapa-siapa yang suka tengok cerita yang you know ada ustad habis ada you know macam
yang suka dengar ah ayat-ayat suci al-quran
you can just uh pergi tengok cerita nur because
apa lagi bila syafiq kyle tengah
fuh syafiq kyle tengah baca al-quran
merdu gila like
banyak lagi ah my ah I have a polaroid of him
I hope kau orang yang tahu situation COVID nineteen ini
tolong lah pakai mask eh tak mahu tak mahu tak pakai mask
because wati sounds like you know bibik bibik punya nama
macam makcik-makcik punya nama you know like bibik wati no please no I mean only only my families can but not my friends okay not
sampai december and I'll be graduating already and I think I'm planning to take um maybe
err talking about language err languages ah I can speak macam biasa melayu
okay so from my understanding right apa tu
the kadi is you book the kadi from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them apa tu
takpe lah it's okay ah
it's okay tak payah banyak-banyak then ya
oh okay jadi kalau kadi tu macam stay further but you select that kadi because you prefer also okay lah oh
boleh ah
tapi I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
oh I see that means kalau if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
oh I I I I takut what or not I takut go in ah then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend kan then is charges takde eh
tapi on that day is your date available already lah on the
oh I see so kirakan before the date available
you go in you select the kadi so err I mean you play with the form tapi you don't submit
oh I I was thinking of doing that tapi macam takut tersubmit then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference ah the the charges ah and then ya so but I was also curious ah I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very err sought much sought sought after lah so don't want to make the mistake ah then that time you book masa tu nya err it's a sunday
mesti popular kan but then err
takut tak dapat kan
dia punya cause the dad is bukan is a non-muslim jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke I think sepuluh then
oh I think about ten ah ya but dia ada lagi satu err punya susah lah pasal um dia nya kadi kan dia tak boleh apa tu
err kalau buat dekat err location lain kan dia nya kadi cannot be yang full time staff
so full time staff sana ada about tiga orang so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english ah so my err number of kadi shrink shrink then entah abeh sekarang nowadays I cannot see the kadi reviews on the web eh dulu got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
he's okay he's fast I prefer pasal dia nya dia nya style is like
berbual sikit then go
ah itu lah ada satu err kadi tu dia quite quite
very eloquent ah tapi bila I tengok dia nya video kan
ya pasal sekarang I know yang satu kadi ni yang I identified this salim jasman I saw
cara dia buat macam betul relax ah err he just
tapi bagus ah because you tak ingat then that means also no stress lah bila baca baca jer ah
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds baku ya
ya lah ya lah tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga ya
tapi yang kadi tu is your family punya err acquaintance ah
oh tapi by then you don't know who that colleague is lah
okay mm okay jadi kirakan my plan sekarang is to go to the website fill up all the details then tapi bila dia punya date available submit straight mm
oh tapi dia to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through kan okay
mm okay same here okay jadi kalau time slot dia is err macam mana tu satu kadi can have more than one time slot ah
okay and then the charges untuk err this registration ada tak
tapi the marriage prep course tak payah kan
tapi yang yang dia tanya tu is masa jumpa kadi
okay yang dia interview tu is
yourself your err bride the the wakil
the wakil from your your wali ah
okay so so sebelum interview dengan kadi is you jumpa the head of the first
oh so jadi yang dekat tu jumpa dia punya punya
oh and tu masa during that time will be the time dia minta to any prep marriage prep course or he ask you to go ah oh that's after oh
okay berapa eh
tiga ratus lebih kan I think dengar-dengar macam tiga ratus lebih
okay oh dia masa tahun bila baru dia cakap tak compulsory eh
huh ye ke oh okay
harus ah
betul juga wah tapi masa tu tak ada wedding cake
pasal dia single single layer kan
ye lah ye lah
tapi yang cake ni is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay
sekarang nowadays they offer macam hotel one they offer dummy cake just to for the photo taking
oh yang jaga makeup okay
mm mm nowadays got pak andam
mm pasal nak ikat dia punya bunga eh
tapi sekali jer kan maybe before the dia nikah jer kan
tapi mak andam sampai the whole day mah
sama lah
cuma cuma dia punya masa tu thinking is dia nak pergi sana cepat so dia ada time to makeup lah tapi
for bride lah ya you dah plan pe
oh tu tak boleh jadi
tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh seh
kirakan sekarang ni macam they are macam err they messed up the err planning
some some some mak andam because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning lah okay
okay dia panic lah okay
kirakan flexible lah okay okay uh huh
mm jadi kirakan kalau macam if we do nikah and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
oh kirakan bukan pasal delay pasal they earn more lah no lah we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
tapi oh but you know how their charges are is like per whole oh not oh
mm tapi prata okay
okay jadi mak andam is not requirement unless you have err several outfit change
oh okay okay jadi sama lah I think for my side I think I don't want to have mak andam I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have err ya
I I even thought of what you know because dekat err katong sana kan there are many err salon ya then we thought err go there early ya
ya cause very close eh because yang grand mercure ada banyak salon ya how good ah that's why I have to go there okay
ya dia pun I email juga mm
most likely we also will do the same thing lah kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi ah the day macam one off saja lah
oh okay mak andam is for rental cause they got special rate
tapi of course photography on the same day is the best lah cheapest ah cheapest lah because you do makeup all that
oh okay so we do the nikah and the photography after that
paling senang dekat dalam hotel tu tak boleh gerak-gerak
mm ya dia nya swimming pool I ever went it looks nice lah so I think I need to ask the person on that day
three three err I think for for your case kan tiga jam macam okay ah very manageable
apa yang teething problems
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem aku outside mah but I can see people no space sit ya
pasal panas oh ya lah hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat err lawn tu mostly budak-budak parents semua tak pergi seh ah
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the nikah
for for my case okay lah terus settle
cause for for err the place I have right there's a stage jadi kalau kirakan okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the nikah start at eleven thirty
lagi-lagi kalau apa tu like what you said
betul juga tapi wedding memang ah orang macam panic kan jadi ada sikit problem sikit lah cuma apa tu
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my nikah so
nikah plus err tea ceremony ya
ya lah siapa nak ikut to the letter kan yes
okay cause I thought the nikah and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
kirakan I want to like macam eleven thirty to one for example is nikah tea ceremony and then
that's also the time kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar lah
okay tapi kalau COVID dia ada different kind of rules ah only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
err out of that twenty they have to be in their table oh but mungkin maybe masa tu policy belum start ah tapi I went to the Grand Mercure right and err
kalau ada COVID infection ah
okay I see but only worry like err yang table yang tak mingle boring ah duduk tengok each other makan cannot mix with the you know
kalau ah
pasal your wedding lain tau your wedding can mingle is a is different cause err your time can be taken ah you know speaking ah
simple simple hmm okay kalau ah
kalau if I
hmm okay okay oh I itu yang category macam err emcee ah yang macam too much lah that's why
I kena fikir juga pasal ni
that is one thing then ya baju you all buy the fabric then make at the joo chiat right
some more is if my date considered is during the syawal tau so have to do it early okay okay lagi apa lagi eh
pasal is it pasal melayu punya photographer oh oh ah
ya nasib baik dewi is not so
you ada kawan
yang boleh yang ada recommend recommend
for photography I tak tahu seh really I
oh ya pandai apa apa pose yes yes
kirakan macam know how to live up the atmosphere then ya
tapi the that time your punya photographer is the that guy is not that good
younger guy was good he was very err dia punya social skills good ah
ya tapi at least dia tahu I mean ya
okay ah terperanjat gue sial lah
err lepas the normal ambil gambar on the dais lepa stu after lunch or
cause I remember you ada macam speech eh tak ada eh so everything
tapi before the ending you all go around each table ambil gambar with everybody ah
okay jadi
hello hi so kita nak start buat err recording

tengok lah you already said if
we still have cikgu suhanis till there what
cikgu iza also still there
ya lah si amirah's grandfather also said the same thing
they have primary school ke
the form aje
bila ah staycation
this one you planning to do for kak ain's birthday right
makan kat mana for dinner
central area lagi kalau nak makan
boleh masak Maggi
I think you all can go jalan-jalan dekat gardens by the bay before that
usually like who want to bangun pagi I cannot bangun pagi man
eh kalau staycation
have you been to the yang itu the art museum
because they have that interacting punya
I forgot the time she I think the one that mama went with kak ain dekat
japan kat tokyo they went to the japan one
then mama cakap ada
like this one this macam interacting nya board gitu so you can draw your own animals
oh then she excited macam budak kecil
since dah macam central central
and then your parents boleh
feeling sikit
because I think dekat Carousell you can find like cheaper tickets
actually tengok-tengok date lah but then if you book december right you can use your voucher mah
is do you think aryan is old enough to masuk
mm then can boleh pakai seh
but you went to Malayan Council before right to makan
makan dekat sana ada that Noosh Noodle Bar
ah if you go the if you go the the art museum kan dah dekat like you walk through the helix bridge lepas tu dah belok
then dah sampai esplanade what esplanade kan][dah dekat
and nak kalau nak mengopi ada coffee bean
and then boleh jalan-jalan can take photos
yang dekat omotesando
like you know the japanese they very macam
generous with their portions so the bun they toast it dia dah toast panas-panas
then lepas tu the amount of lobster that they stuffed inside that
ya I feel like semua orang cakap it's um expensive lagi mahal but then I feel like if you record eh uh record pula if you um
convert it back right the price is actually the same as the one dekat japan because dekat japan they have the regular size and size
dekat sini they only have size
having it in your own currency that's why I think like people nya mindset macam
ni lagi mahal seh
ah berbual for what
kat japan boleh makan pe but now you're not going japan right so
because I see dekat macam online blog gitu I feel like it's
okay lah dia macam tak lokek
ya ya ya ya ya I thought you were the one yang tanya what is yakiniku
dekat the place itself
so they give you raw beef dia macam Seoul Garden Seoul Garden tapi it's just beef
I had the one dekat japan also it was so good the halal one
so we went and then we went for um during lunch time dia macam tak crowded even though there's so many people at the
and then they had dish macam dish eh
they had this macam
um raw beef set like the bento tapi with raw beef
then the griller dekat depan
so you get to grill your own tapi it's like a bento
dish is like lauk right
like I don't mind eating the Luke's Lobster everyday for my rest of my life the roti
but it's a dish mah so I thought it's um macam should be included
okay I think I will choose um clam vongole mama punya clam vongole
with lots of cili padi and um
confirm rumah dia besar eh
like have you seen um will smith punya rumah
it's like tingkat bertingkat and then kat belakang ada swimming pool
uh apa tu
will smith punya rumah punya gambar
dorang jalan jauh-jauh pun they will stay around their house
ada macam living room a'ah
dia just kekal
you can be tak handsome but then have a good uh fit body tapi I'm like
once you have a fit body kalau muka tak handsome then I'm like
like you see some model pun macam
eh badan dia buff seh sekali dia pusing ah kau
genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
my favourite channel is the crime investigation channel dekat rumah
tapi sekarang dah tak ada seh
uh like for example conjuring dengan annabelle
because dia macam okay they want to act
make it macam as if oh betul betul happening betul betul like
abeh macam if you macam fikir balik like
who has the camera on their hand like twenty four seven gitu
I mean it's a good macam
maybe dulu is a good macam good thing for a change lah
don't know I like the way she tells the story macam very interesting like she doesn't macam she talks a lot but it is like she doesn't macam
macam tak boring gitu
you know some people nanti dorang macam berbual berbual
and then halfway it gets boring because macam too draggy
tapi and then this
ya I I finished all the ones dekat Facebook
dekat YouTube is still ongoing
there's this one movie dekat Netflix
I didn't know the story was out on Netflix macam a few years ago I thought dia baru keluar
because dulu when
dia keluar bila two thousand eight kan eh two thousand eighteen
the movie keluar
why recently Netflix macam dorang released so many macam documentaries
tomorrow kerja petang seh I think malam that malam after since tutup I think I can watch
macam dah lama nak lah like you wish
so dari kecil sampai sekarang you like
rumah besar as in like
so like balas jasa gitu
tapi dulu when SARS happened
I'm in I think primary school kot lupa
ya then dia tak serabak now lah like
tapi COVID is like
from one country then lepas tu another country then lepas tu tiba-tiba like the whole world sampai
airports semua tutup sia like
like tiba tiba orang tengah kerja macam
these people like some people in the world like let's say the they not taking this macam seriously
tu ah
I mean tapi sekarang re-election so I feel like
tapi macam tu lah I mean korang nak the COVID to finish
to end to finally like macam
no more new cases tu semua everybody to heal
until tak nak dengar like to wear mask wash your hands
tapi orang tak nak dengar then like
esok kerja eh
esok kerja petang seh
you know my tempat kerja ada budak baru
it's a malay guy then he budak T
he's on internship and because I thought when he masuk
usually kalau
oh I didn't really actually get to ask him but it was so macam terkejut like oh you from polytechnic I'm like oh ya
I mean like okay then you would be more familiarised with the macam
like you know the courses tu semua how the works tapi macam
macam sensitive issue lah because they usually macam
deal with macam money money um orang bayarkan
dorang bayar duit tu join courses tu semua so maybe they like
they don't let us have an account to do that kind of things just in case we make any mistakes ke apa ke
so they will only let the senior yang kerja lama kat sana tu
so kita orang usually ada
kita duduk counter jer kat
ya lah dekat office ah
so dah passion card layan tu ni but then
to um apa tu apply for you know the
under macam not everything can buat right
a'ah especially kalau macam the
issue is about government punya duit like government bagi duit because of this COVID right so they'll think like
they already like refer them to us then after that kita orang macam then they come to the then after that we tell them that
then you know macam tak happy lah
ya then after that the other day got this one makcik lah she was disappointed because we couldn't help her with the application
we cannot even like use other people punya computer
your issue lah tapi macam for us is sensitive because
sekali kalau apa-apa ya
sekali your information is all leaked or what then I'm like okay that's why
jap tengok dia punya battery
ya so I said go to but then dorang cakap ah very far I cannot walk and all
oh but I'm doing this for my mother and then she cannot walk or what then a bit leceh so far
adik stop
dia cakap she applied
uh apa tu she passed away
that means the person punya mum
but then they keep like arguing macam
especially if it's like racial issue macam
because I'm malay right and then after that if there's a makcik who came
if there's a makcik who come by
tolong sikit pun tak boleh kita kan melayu
so it's like that my kerja is like that
uh as a housing officer dekat dormitory punya office
mm I'll be in the office lor so basically kalau that office is for the foreign workers kalau let's say they have
pay them on time ke apa like this kind of problem they will come to the office and tu
I told them I was like ya but then maybe you'll be doing macam roundings ke apa ke so you like
dia kata macam you know macam Expo event but every day
eh medical interview pula the medical check-up
dorang berbual english
orh okay tu tempat landed landed nya tempat oh okay okay
then kalau macam
so that means the classes macam
like let's say if the that means one teacher ada fifteen right then means half of that
macam like around tujuh ke lapan orang then halfway dorang uh balik tidur
they also belajar
usually macam after dorang punya macam so called
before that makan ke lepas tu makan
oh dorang makan dulu eh orh so macam
then makan
jaga budak ya I think it's
dia macam malu eh
okay abang so how our renovation plans
hari raya wah you so confident now is still COVID do you think can celebrate hari raya yet
like our siblings four ya I think around there so maybe direct families only can celebrate hari raya
why are we talking about hari raya
so nanti I pergi um
nanti I pergi Popular I beli cardboard
I beli kertas yang keras tu then uh I
cari gambar nanti I print
nanti I cetak nanti I print lepas tu nanti boleh tampal lah dekat cardboard itu
tak lah itu itu kena tunggu nanti nanti bila jumpa dengan dia punya
apa designer itu nanti baru dia bilang baru kita boleh tanya sekarang pun kita kita just um
kita just baca-baca jer tak tahu betul ke tak ke kan
buat lawak ah
kita kita pun tak tahu apa yang company err company itu nak apa nak
tunjuk kita nak bagi kita kan jadi
jadi kita just
kita ambil ambil gambar inspirasi jer lah letak kat dalam mood board itu
hari itu I dah tunjuk you gambar dekat WhatsApp dah tengok belum
ha ya lah habis group mana
corak oh okay ah if it's the kitchen then I like the open concept
betul juga uh uh eh paling tidak nanti kita masak nanti habis semua uh apa itu
uh almari perabot semua berminyak yang hari itu ingat tak yang kita panggil apa itu
orang yang uh cucikan sofa
sekali dia cakap dia punya minyak yang melekat itu apa yang kotoran yang melekat itu actually dari daripada minyak masak
lepas itu uh yang bahagian luar itu yang dekat uh platform itu
yang yang dulu actually nak buat musollah lepas itu tak jadi
sebenarnya bukan nak hack nak nak buang uh yang lama punya platform sebab
sebab platform itu satu dah bunyi dua dah reput
tiga kayu pun dah nak dah nak terkopek dah dah nak reput lah itu dah nak err dia punya hujung itu dah terkopek jadi macam ada lubang
lepas itu bawah platform itu pun kita tak tahu jadi sarang binatang apa mungkin sarang cicak
uh huh buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak vinyl dulu kan lepas itu nanti dah ada
letak vinyl dan kalau ada budget then baru boleh tambah platform
okay tak apa itu nanti
that one I that one that idea came from tak I nampak hari itu my friend dia tengah buat renovation sekarang
lepas itu dia upload dekat uh story
lepas itu dia pakai glass itu ah um dia pun ada that same same sama punya segi balcony lepas itu dia
ah dia dia yang dia yang I nampak daripada story dia lah yang dia pakai glass itu kalau tidak I pun jadi tak tahu macam mana nak replace that that tingkap dengan
dengan apa so idea dia datang itu lah I ternampak story my friend
dia ada tag hari itu tapi I tak ingat ada dia ada tag uh
dia dia popular juga apa eh nama dia eh tak ingat ah
ya habis sekarang I scolding ah everytime they upload video
ah nanti I pergi intai dia punya video tengok apa progress cari idea
abang you boleh tolong tengok-tengokkan tak apa jenis tingkap yang ada you tolong scolding kan ke kat jiran-jiran daripada bawah I
I kan tadi nampak juga ada satu itu dia punya uh tingkap cantik
dia satu yang dia pakai yang uh sorot punya yang lagi satu yang buka punya uh yang macam ketat
uh ketat punya macam mana nak cakap eh yang ada yang ada handle eh
ah tapi cantik dia macam simple saja tapi cantik
tapi masalahnya sekarang sliding pun binatang masuk mungkin dah haus agaknya dah bertahun
tak lah tingkap okay actually dia orang cakap kalau boleh cari supplier sendiri pun bagus tapi sudah lah
ini tingkap lagi nak buat satu rumah already yang kan sudah
dulu bunyi dia tak macam itu kuat tau dulu bunyi dia perlahan sahaja I bila kat dapur baru bunyi
sekarang daripada bilik hujung dah boleh dengar maknanya apa maknanya dia dah besar dah dah sedap makan dah sempat membesar you tak bunuh dia sebab itu I cakap kena panggil
time for a renovation already cannot make cannot lah I cannot tahan already is
him a a liar but we didn't even say that you know suddenly and then he just went off out of the gate like merajuk
you tahu macam merajuk perempuan ah okay lah okay lah apa
saya tipu lah saya tipu lah okay lah bye bye
emotional ah uncle itu
tak boleh lupa eh kelakar
okay whatever you call it ah ya that one also some already uh like uh apa itu
he ask us to go and see the tile but actually he already got a tile in his hand he already know what he want to do for us already merepek right
maybe lah he want to save that way or what alamak then I regret seh sekarang menyesal seh tak pakai tiles yang kita pilih
dah bersusah payah kita pergi hafari lepas itu pilih yang kita nak lepas itu dia suka-suka hati pula habis kita pun tak tahu datang kita pergi ya kan saja
itu lah dia cakap tak tak jadi jadi tak uh tak licin tak jatuh
ya they just give us rough idea there's no three D or whatever pun so
habis uh nak kena plan nak kena
plan itu lagi budget lagi nak kena plan budget nanti you bilang I nanti I buatkan breakdown
kan so kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa kan toilet pun kita baru buat cuma maybe kalau tiles itu memang
tak bagus itu tukar saja lah sebab dia punya slope pun ingat tak kita kan suruh dia buat slope jadi air pun mengalir betul pergi kat longkang itu tapi
pun masih bertakung tau I cuci toilet pun I tahu masih bertakung macam tak betul dia punya slope dia
uh uh tapi yang macam accessories macam tempat mandi uh apa itu picit-picit nak cebok ah tu semua
uh boleh pakai balik ah so at least itu dah save cost sebab itu pun under dalam quotation juga
ah itu dah save cost lah lagi perabot pun kalau kat rumah
kalau let's say ada budget untuk buat yang rumah punya pun actually perabot tak payah cuma kita just ambil gambar ah kita tunjukkan gambar dia perabot-perabot yang kita ada
tengok tema apa yang sesuai dengan perabot kita sebab perabot kita pun considered
uh apa itu macam modern apa modern minimalist pun boleh sebab warna kelabu macam itu kan senang sikit lah
mm modern juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak mm
lagi apa eh kita dah tukar eh
so far yang kat dalam toilet itu ya lah kan lampu uh ya so hopefully
mm tak ada lah sekarang plan dia is ini tak standard plan is one uh kitchen two toilet
sebab itu kalau you nak buat kitchen saja ini susah memang dia comes together so might as well buat saja
sebab kalau kita sikit-sikit you tengok sikit-sikit kita buat tiga K habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit then end up kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya kan
so kita betul-betul buat sekaligus lah lagi pun toilet
lagi pun uh bilik air dengan dapur dah sebelah-sebelah kan habis kita nak rombak itu lagi kita nak pecahkan tembok itu ah
eh sekali terus habuk semua lah
ah betul
lagi bilik bilik aqi pun
mm bilik aqi pun dia punya lantai pun dah kopak itu kalau nak pasang vinyl vinyl sahaja
dah berapa uh that time eight hundred kan lapan ratus vinyl sahaja dah lapan ratus habis ini
kita kena buka balik sebab nak kena pecahkan balik dekat pintu toilet itu semua nak kena
mm kalau kita buat balik lah
itu kan pintu toilet itu kan dah reput bawah dia itu yang itu nak kena nak kena
hack nak kena plaster balik
semua akan affected
tapi ini click function kan vinyl itu remember
tak boleh lah ini ini kena potong kena apa kena measure sembarang saja
entah nanti tak tersempurna lagi ha
tak boleh dah haus you tengok dia punya
dia punya tengok ini dah hitam hitam itu maknanya dia dah ada gap lah dia dah ada jarang-jarang in between dia punya ini kayu
then how how because vinyl pun boleh kembang ikut uh panas atau sejuk tau bilik
ah dalam bertahun ah ini ini pun macam tak tukar ha ini dah kembang lah ini nampak line dia ada gap
lepas itu tak boleh ada gap itu hit itu lah dia dah ini merekah lah itu
uh uh eh ini tak bagus ini I think murah punya ini bukan yang vinyl tau ini yang
dia orang pandai kan eh
tak ada lah kak dengan children bukan tak minat macam kadang-kadang saya tengok children
macam ah awkward lah I mean dia orang cute tapi
tapi saya tak tahu tak biasa lah dengan budak-budak no offence nurul

luxury shopping usually um to all the major brands lah yang ada dekat singapore
ah apa that is err one of it is Louis Vuitton
um so yang basically yang perempuan suka ialah beg kasut ah
ah but ah but clothing tak sangat lah
ah clothing selalunya apa I
kalau I pakai biasa punya or cheaper one is is fine with me but I more into like luxury bags
ah so one of it that is like my my my my my favourite lah yang I suka pakai
ah okay so beside ah luxury shopping I pun suka one of it lately I like to cook
ah so ah the cooking passion ni pun macam just ah
terbaru yang I macam discover myself that I can the ability to cook lah
so with ah apa the
ah with the time that I have ah may maybe the weekend and also the apa the flexibility that you say orh okay anything lah you nak masak apa
pun you ah you macam you I can try lah and you pun cakap ah okay let's try
we give me the apa the
apa like the encouragement ah untuk
follow follow by the book lah kan ah follow by the rule gitu
ya lah the more the more the the good cook the the good food nanti ah the more ah rounder they become ah
ya lah dulu pun you okay lah not not apa your your form of exercise also is one of the hobbies juga kan
that was apa you suka bermain bola sepak
think ah watching apa football match eh
is ah very different between kalau kita tengok dekat apa
ah stadium dengan tengok dekat
apa on the YouTube or apa yang dekat television ah so for me I pun suka tengok
ah football match and which is zaman gemilang during apa the malay cup yes itu kita berapa tahun eh we were like
macam ah maybe in our teens eh there was the enjoyable time macam anak-anak kita will not
so that time was wah macam
pergi sana beratur going there
then apa duduk kat the bench you know the the the bench yang lama tu kan
dah tak ada cannot
sekarang apa stadium pun dah dibuat baru very macam high technology it can it can actually consist of banyak
uh apa uh spectators you know fifty sixty sixty thousand so
with apa the ability to macam so much apa
ah apa ah the good facility why can't we revive the apa
punya apa ah um
satu message jer cakap ah I be late I lambat
so macam oh so the apa kalau let's say dulu kan technology is takde
so it's like macam oh we will try to our best our very very best to be on time
and now technology tu memang bagus I I tak I tak no doubt
then again kita boleh macam ah when we ah macam sit down berbual sama-sama kan
we like eh dulu how can macam mana to survive eh
macam mana dulu takde takde handphone okay lah pager pun ah come when we are in
uh tak tak
not not not so new lah tapi eh how we survive kita punya childhood macam mana eh ah so
or let's say kalau pergi tempat makan ah sekarang kena oh reservations
dulu terjah aje kan kalau ada tempat tempat lah kalau takde tak tak okay lah takde tak tak tak
kira peredaran zaman ah macam kita macam takde oh we cannot say that oh we are so
ah we cannot macam
ikut sangat pada technology nor kita is apa
totally macam ke belakang
I guess at the right pace you know depending on your sendiri punya apa
ah I I think because of the pandemic also macam it actually
menyuruh macam kita ni apa have to apa be more ah high tech
like if let's say macam kita tak tahu apa macam mana apa nak buat apa ah macam dekat apa zoom meeting for the kids
ya we like kita suka apa travelling
ah australia betul
macam macam ni lah this this year tergendala kan our plans nak pergi apa ah travelling
tapi I macam kita pergi ah
mana tu australia ah for me itu that that is the first time kita apa
sebagai apa suami isteri eh husband and wife
the ah go for a good ah apa honeymoon
ah so yang itu kita beritahu oh how how is our shopping eh shopping pula ah kita punya as a partner eh ah
ah apa what you call it
pattern lah ah ah perangai
kirakan iya lah because of our nine years of marriage
sekarang kalau you know the pattern oh
kan kalau macam kita apa
kalau macam something that ah happen atau macam anything emergency okay
siapa yang boleh macam apa react
ah the reaction yang selalu comes from you ah so kalau macam ah apa
ah more to like apa
apa ah to set the apa the goal ah apa kita nak pergi mana nak pergi mana that one yang itu I yang
ah selalunya apa ah tapi anything need reaction
ah planning ah kalau is is kalau hotel
bukan bukan nak bukan nak gaduh lah tapi kalau macam
need attention need macam apa kena tinggi suara eh ah itu I think that one I will step in lah kan
apa tak siap ke apa when we come hotel lambat like our room is not ready
ah ataupun kita punya travelling ada hiccups sikit kan ah need need macam
authority-ness kan ah itu itu itu I will apa
kena ke depan lah ya
ah you you lelaki you ke depan ah kan
kalau let's say I boleh control kan ah get my way okay then
you tak kan apa you don't need to you
um untuk keselesaan kita lah kalau kita travelling ah macam kita
we don't get what we wanted we pay you dah bayar mahal kan
is in order ah kan kita tak
minta macam oh bilik macam
five star ke apa ke you know for us it's like security
okay kalau the experience of the travelling apa yang macam
ah any location yang macam very
ah apa significant for you tak macam yang you will really like wah
ah apa
ah location kan macam for let's say we went to indonesia

so kita macam apa
err macam cross cross fingers okay come let's let's
sama juga lah ah
tapi yang itu sebab itu I cakap oh think I tak nak shop[ah
itu itu okay itu I I rasa-rasa I
I make a mistake I oh I tak nak shop because but the thing is how we go to why we go jakarta because is
apa for this ah apa jakarta trip

shopping dia wah is a one of the shopping paradise but you have to be very careful lah
and ada satu one location yang kita pergi is tanah
tanah abang eh itu macam
more macam wholesale punya
ah apa so
let's say kalau you nak beli you must kena beli macam bundle tau macam more kalau let's say
ah cheaper rather than you buy satu ah
so itu that one very
ah so kalau let's say macam beli tu kan macam I cakap I tak nak beli tiga cakap saya tak mahu beli tiga atau lima
boleh tak kurang sikit tak boleh then pilih colour lain ah
macam-macam colour lah so
ah okay then I I ah saya
I I try to give to my sister ke apa ke

oh eh then kita pergi penang ah penang kita dah ada boys ah
her their boys and my boys tapi ah I
lebih besar lah ah
yang itu pun oh
ah betul
yang penang tu pasal masa time tu penang
banjir yang teruk I think it was
err tiga tahun yang lalu ah tiga tahun yang lalu
kan memang apa
kita pun masa time tu pun ah
tak tahu nak pergi ke tidak terjun botol ah
ah ada macam kawan kan kerja apa kerja dekat airport cakap boleh lah kak boleh you can go no problem is it's the the it's not like macam apa tu macam kalau travelling restriction macam apa bang

in the end ada dua family jer
dengan dia pun tiga orang so total enam orang so pergi lah
penang pun ah kita enjoy ah
satu location tu yang kita suka pergi tu was the P ramlee ah
the P ramlee dia originally from apa orang penang kan
ah so tempat dia very so called macam museum lah macam museum
macam berapa tahu lah didn't didn't know that much about err apa this rumah P ramlee ni
and and obviously dia punya apa the driver was a eh is a is a indian guy
so dia pun tak tahu macam kalau orang local melayu ah different lah
mungkin kita pun macam macam so keen gitu kan
ah nampak you pun gaya macam P ramlee gitu ah no kita kita
dia orang tua so kita macam kita respect
orang tu pun nak bercerita kan so kita macam ah okay lah we we we
he he talk to us kita mesti reciprocate lah jangan macam oh kita sombong kan tidak
ah orang tu berbual pasal P ramlee orang dia macam gini I think dia dia dia apa pernah jumpa P ramlee lah
mana oh dia kawan um mm
so okay macam we had fun there then kita pergi yang apa tu yang yang the
ah tapi dalam gambar the tower tu macam bridge dia ah you can actually see
ah is a apa is a see through transparent punya transparent punya tower ah kita ingat berapa panjang lah dia punya tower
jambatan tu apa bang is a bridge ah bridge ah
so kita oh dalam kita pun yang technology apa kita kita Google lah kita check oh you must go here
sekali ah tapi raja dia tu takut eh dia takut height
member security apa badan
tough gila tapi takut height okay lah
tapi pergi sana jer eh eh
senonek jer macam it's not that just a just a half a circle macam okay lah tapi kita pun
nak kalau nak ambil gambar mesti tahu the right angle so kalau kalau you
you ambil gambar the right angle orang cakap wah dia ni naik
macam apa macam bagus gitu lah tapi it's very small lah
tapi you kena pakai ni you have to wear macam protection punya apa
ah macam so called covered our shoe tu kan
ah and of course lah obviously you tak boleh apa
ah macam hentak-hentak lah kan
tapi yang kita disappointment tu pasal kita tak boleh pergi naik apa tu the famous cable car
itu we were hoping pasal banjir kan so tutup because ada land slide
bukit bendera the punya famous ah
cable car kalau you datang penang you mesti naik tu ah but
kita we apa tried tapi dia punya attraction tutup kan pasal land slide so we we cannot go
ah so okay lah macam itu macam really disappointed tapi kita dah like I said kita pergi pun terjun botol kan
kita tak tahu apa-apa ah whether masih banjir because on the news totally ah almost tiap-tiap hari kita tengok news
banjir dia dah dah surut ke belum macam we were hoping ah
tapi the thing ya lah kalau let's say kita cancel but there is no travelling restriction we don't get back
kalau macam let's say ah the the minister ah okay no restriction tak boleh pergi penang ah then yes
son kalau topic dengan berbual dengan driver pun one of it is ah apa cakap pasal apa banjir itu lah
a'ah kalau tidak dia kena pergi macam go longer way lah longer route
conserving atau err uh
and one of the attraction kita pergi ah yang apa the apa terbalik tu apa bang
upside down museum itu kalau orang pergi pun mesti because eh
err penang tu like I said dia punya attraction dia tu tak banyak dia punya attractions tu bukit bendera tu so kalau ah I think kalau dia punya other attractions macam all sorts of museum lah dorang buat ada yang macam cup apa
food ah food museum lah upside down museum ada three three three D museum three D museum so kita pergi I think about kita pergi dua ya bang kan kita pergi dua museum tapi yang upside down tu bagus
ada juga ah
kita dapat seratus eh seratus
tapi sana bayaran dia dalam malaysia ringgit bang sini singapore dollar so kat sana pun kalau dorang
charge apa ah apa empat puluh ringit kan bagi kita ah just about
lain cerita lah kan kalau let's say kat sana pun kita kalau beli makan pun in ringgit you know macam alah jangan cakap lah apa rindu lah dengan apa malaysia ada kat sana ah
betul ah
kita family of four ah
can be found ye lah
ah bosan kita tiga orang aja um kita ye lah apa ah apa
kita tengok kita dengar dari news kan oh there's no apa ah zero no new cases no local new cases kita macam harap-harap just make it zero lah make it zero make it zero kan
then kalau macam tempat locations oh dekat sini ada apa visited by COVID nineteen
so we try to avoid lah that that place tapi kalau sometimes it's unavoidable
tu pun tak boleh juga kan macam eh hari tu ada kat ion hotel ah ion orchard hotel ah ah orchard shopping centre
kita pergi sana kan tapi kena ikhtiar lah
what what we can do is that like I say we are wearing mask is one of the protection so kita dengan ni kita good hygiene dah mesti dah mesti instill in you already
ah so let's say kita pakai apa pakai hand sanitiser
okay then ada disposable bag
dua puluh dua puluh satu dua puluh satu tu ah memang apa harapan banyak lah dalam apa dua puluh dua puluh satu
bukan only bukan only financially financially memang itu kalau orang dekat singapore ni mesti
hopefully ah apa naik gaji naik pangkat
okay lah but you know we have to be realistic ah kan sekarang ni kita like I say still in a pandemic situation kan
secara tak langsung kita nak ah apa increase kita punya ah
number of children family members ah tu yang kita target lah inshallah kalau ni in dua puluh dua puluh satu kan ah
ah if everything goes smoothly and the planning is semua betul inshallah then we can apa
have a try another one doesn't matter lah like I said it's a boy or girl twins ke apa ke you know semuanya datang dari dia kita terima lah
tapi tapi kita mesti ada satu kepala lah
kan kalau let's say kalau you ada
you punya vision you tu oh macam gini gini tapi kalau macam orang keliling you tak cooperate tak ada kasi kerjasama akan pengsan juga bang ah so it's like you know kalau you know kalau your vision must be clear ah kalau let's say
tak munasabah tak adil ah macam you you apa
kalau let's say dia dia tak nak ikut kita punya apa perancangan kita cara kita tapi kalau ada masalah jer oh fall back ah datang balik pada you eh kau tolongkan aku gini kan tak boleh lah gitu macam bagi
bagi I ye lah macam you you ni apa kepala keluarga eh kan ah tapi jangan lupa isteri pun ada peranan dia kan isteri dia ialah dian punya neck neck tu apa bang
ah leher pada apa ah
ya lah ya lah so ya lah itu then then then
ah apa kawan-kawan apa relative lain tu anak kita adik kan dia is part of the body lah kan itu akan jadi seorang orang lah kan
special eh tapi you think
ah tahun twenty twenty one dia boleh macam
kita punya kes tu dia boleh move forward tak macam kita boleh apa dapat sekolah ke
semua no semua macam hiccup dia it comes from this pandemic kita nak pergi apa

turkey and greece are big and powerful cyprus is a bit of their little cousin now it's so small and turkey and greece are pulling it cause it has a lot of like is very famous for the farmland it has good natural resources um good location so like macam turkey greece macam
you sudah kenyang kan
what ice cream tak kenyang ah you sure you just ice cream I can buy
at first I thought like bedek lah ini macam global myth ah tapi macam then a lot of people was really cause there is no confirmation you you hear a lot of the story on the internet
bersunat ah
can semua boleh work from home
ah nampak lama sangat
cause turkey turkey has always prided itself on being a a circular state like they are they are muslim majority but they are also like very very proud they are very proud of their progressiveness like err women don't need to wear the the tudung and ya lah I mean it's good but
the ones who are actually voicing out are not the saudi arabians when ya which is very sad the one who's making noise is the progressive one you know turkey turkey is the one that eh dia ini macam macam mahu but they are the ones actually advocating for change so I don't know I it's so messed up
macam brotherhood lah
oh he got to K so he he got tahan because he take itself lah you that's the border the demarcation then you of course he gonna get in trouble they cross the thing you got the
I mean kalau pergi mana-mana
I tak cerita sebanyak kalau nak pergi mana tapi yang penting err
if I were to go travel I I got a plan like I mean not so plan but if like if anybody got any suggestion eh why not we go to this place pergi tempat ni lah macam best jer ah I just ikut jer ah you punya orang kita lah how about you
and winter will be interesting because tak pernah experience salji macam salji mesti lah sejuk kan tapi from what I know ah
tengok pokok-pokok ah pokok lupa nama dia tapi it's pink in colour merah jambu pokok tu tengok macam dekat bila kita jalan ambil gambar pun cantik apa kan so cantik jer pokok tu I think I like pretty stuff lah I mean who doesn't like pretty stuff like when you take photo it will look good on you so ya
what's the name for the ya so I'll bring them to kampung glam because of I remember masa time dulu ah sekolah rendah sekolah menengah kan mesti ada field trip like they will bring us to a few places in singapore then we can just enjoy right so I remember going to kampung glam
and masa tu time tu sekolah rendah lah dia orang bawa kita pergi ah
it was very interesting at first sight because ah I mean kita kalau macam mana nak cakap ah kita orang melayu pun kadang-kadang pun tak pergi tempat yang kita punya culture where where it is what so it's like when I go there
it's interesting because I found interesting games macam permainan-permainan orang dulu suka main ah macam gasing or chapteh lagi ada five stones there are five stones
so ya I think I am more attracted dengan dia punya permainan-permainan orang-orang dulu lah oh ada lagi ada congkak dia orang pun ada jual congkak dia ada lagi jual macam-macam lah macam-macam permainan lah macam permainan dulu-dulu I think I'm
I would not say I grew up watching it lah how how would I explain it dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok drama korea macam cuma drama melayu macam dekat channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so I I bet everybody knows this so masa tu macam ah eh tengok ah boys over
flowers best tau cerita dia ah cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya then nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni then I was like
oh okay mula dengar macam oh okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
like people using fake profiles macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu then orang mesti macam eh I want tinggi wah cik lawa ah buat kawan ah kan
aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau I'm here for you like you know
macam dalam dunia ni itu kan macam movie ah tu kan based on
non-fiction what so it's like bila ada movie macam gini macam wah macam dia orang pakai macam magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
three hours is because uh they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture what ya when making movies lah but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it ah it dia ada macam crime crime scene kat dalam tu
so macam never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
teletubbies punya patung I mean I tak collect banyak lah I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two two of the characters I think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is ah
own macam dia orang ada macam dia orang punya character dia orang ada macam barang macam tinky-winky ada handbag kalau dipsy dia ada topi dia kan then ah laa-laa dia ada dia punya orange orange bounce ball
you can say spongebob like who doesn't watch spongebob right like spongebob so macam macam spongebob pun unik juga pasal spongebob berkawan dengan uh dengan apa dengan starfish they call it right ya dia berkawan dengan starfish kawan dengan uh sotong
mesti sudah tentu titanic siapa
siapa yang dengar nama titanic tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal kan cerita pasal kapal
cinta wah that was the first movie also right yang very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting eh yang ini oh I got I got a question for you um if you have three wishes what would you wish for
err terutama saya suka I suka makan I suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan kan I mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
food also is something like kita boleh
kita boleh macam explore you can go like
macam try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
uh it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind pasal yang
kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir kan dia macam dia diam jer jadi if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking apa dalam minda dia macam wah
I can maybe like let's say nak buat kawan kita because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people lah if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like oh okay dia ni rasa macam gini-gini maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind what so
I think I mean like that's part of uh your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam
yang kecil-kecil lah you know tapi mana ada yang macam
and like tapi apa-apa pun in the end it's all you know it's all up to you lah actually
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like masuk kedai jer ah nak beli baju ni lah ah kena bayar tak payah bayar okay
I mean just bawa balik I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean biasa lah sometimes kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli eh nanti guna ke tak tak guna eh tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna so
be a healing process because like you plant berkebun I mean lepas tu you tanam any pokok ah any bunga atau pokok yang yang favourite lah kan tanam then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
tanam maybe like you can tanam fruits buah-buahan sayur-sayuran I got a neighbour ah ah my neighbour likes to plant ah
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also macam
ada macam tanam cili padi habis you nak cili padi daun kari daun kari for me it's very common daun kari then ada apa lagi eh macam bunga-bunga
bunga rose I don't know if it's common bunga rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of uh food what
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek kan macam
kena bahan ini lah bahan itu lah tapi nak dia punya process the process of making it is is very hard what so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
ah favourite lagu genre genre genre macam genre melayu ke genre ah sembarang-sembarang apa-apa genre kalau apa-apa genre
err if I were to say well we both like K pop but if genre lain would be macam
genre lagu-lagu pop lagu pop pop like lagu
oh cakap pasal lagu pop macam teringat kalau lagu ah you know pop yeh yeh it's the malays well it I always like to bring back to to the old times then like I say my friend see me as like ah throwback throwback kind of person ya lagu pop yeh yeh is
masa tu memang masa tu kita sekolah rendah eh sekolah rendah kita dah dengar lagu pop yeh yeh that was that was the band that I think that was the first I forgot what's the band's name I forgot what's the band's name but that was the first
ah malay band that I listen to at that point of time I think it's because of my sister like she also listens to this kind of like ya but ya pop yeh yeh ya it's like in dari korea tu biasa lah kan ya for me like lagu irama melayu would be the pop melayu lah they call it pop pop
live music pernah pergi dengan
band ah apa nama band tu westlife
alah boleh lupa pula ah band nama tu ah I pergi dengan my kakak kita pergi because my ni minat uh westlife sebenarnya so it was more meaningful and especially because it falls on her birthday this was back
uh it was last year ya it was last year ya basically it was last year we went for this concert ah this westlife concert it was a very that was the second time I went for concert yang live usually I tak pergi pasal I
ah satu duit kan very ah macam mahal kan tapi like this time round um my sister decided like me and the price is affordable so I was like eh you like this band why not we go also ya so was very
oh ugh my talking about shopping just now right uh fashion style I'm more to a casual side macam santai-santai tak ada anything very dramatic atau macam I suka pakai simple simple just a simple one like
pakai T-shirt seluar
err kasut tak kisah lah kasut ke sandal ah tu jer I'm I'm that type of I don't go for very like dramatic of like like ya I rarely wear accessories too but only recently
so you know me you know my collections I just decided to cause it was it was unique and cool because pasal it was handmade tak pernah nampak macam susah nak nampak ah kat luar tu orang jual macam handmade earring macam
I'm more to of a warm tone warm tone in a sense macam colour
ya I I don't go for macam colour colour macam
macam terang hijau terang terang dia macam terang you know what I mean right macam you look at wow it's so it's so bright on you like I don't wear bright colours I'm not that that kind
and warna hitam warna hitam siapa takde kan dalam global mesti ada kan so hitam is I think
hitam like is the is the main ah but for me like ya it's the warm colours how about eh ya
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight macam macam mana nak cakap eh kita jumpa orang tu first time then kejar I'm not terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta I mean I
ah faham faham ya ya ada orang pun fikir
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people mesti tengok macam wah dia ni kacak ah dia ni macam handsome jer ah tapi tu ah fikir-fikir balik ah kita like would you really
alamak okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking teh O ais limau dengan syrup syrup limau ya alamak if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup limau dengan teh O ice I will pilih teh O ice
I mean syrup syrup manis I mean I teh pun manis lah kan tapi teh lagi macam lagi like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting wah
it's just mi apa noodle
kalau sound uh
actually any sound tu I takde idea tapi macam if you were to ask me if ah I tak pergi where what is ah my favourite place to go I will pick uh
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same I think it's particularly because I like to watch flowers bunga basically like I said lah bunga cantik like I really really really

dia cakap okay lah habis dia cakap then how ah why like that I have to solve myself lah you ibu cakap

habis ibu cakap ya ya ya ya
tapi the night before I think before dia buat I think wednesday
can I just confirm that those bento change to dulang
is four bento of ayam and four bento of daging am I right
so masa itu ibu tengah tengok jadi ibu ibu cakap okay wassalam sis zus yes including four kebab so I think they misunderstood this
bila dia cakap salam can you just confirm yang those bento change to dulang
is four bento ayam and four bento of daging and rice so dia pergi taruh into one dulang
so maybe they refer balik to this
tapi dia tak pergi refer balik to the table then I cakap you look at the table table I put there four set
uh marah lah then
I brought actually I just inform err apa ibu bilang aunty bait jer yang okay no need to cook uh I'm giving you something to eat lah habis aunty bait cakap okay lah so the rest ibu tak bilang uh aunty lisha ibu bilang because ibu takut dia bawa siapa mika pergi swimming

buat apa masak banyak-banyak kan tak ada orang nak makan
nasi itu kan
jadi dia masak lah jadi macam ibu boleh bawa balik lah
mm so that's why ini ibu bawa balik lah
ini pasal singlish but then kau suruh ibu berbual melayu
oh it was so much fun after a long time I tak pergi kerja then went back so met um
um macam in a small group lah instead of last time one big group
group lah but no more number of days dia panjang ah um james was the in charge ah it's quite fun lah
screening right they are prepared awal you know I mean normal
kerja dari rumah more relax they says ah then they say oh then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
tadi tadi one is from um one's from mycrone
if nenek pekik-pekik
because I told bibik to give anxiety pill early
I think nenek is more on anxiety rather than depression ah because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
ah so I guess it's more anxiety than dari depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit termenung thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then uh there is
and she started want to pray then she ah tak yakin that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
not um it's quite to say lah couple of days when she was at the peak um which is really really very I should say macam mana very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
her macam worse or ataupun dia punya um paling tinggi lah dia punya mengamuk atau dementia punya err
so as what you say lah maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like macam quite ah quite more peaceful um
um more macam if she she shouted yell and err
but not much and then err at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming ataupun nak minta keluar from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just redha jer lah ikhlas and redha
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone itu sahaja um from last time she doesn't want to be alone
hantu are not human
she's very garang human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing lah she's very scared the rest I don't think so lah macam people she's not afraid of lah none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
of course lah unless she says like stupid things lah then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans lah merepek jer accounting but cute lah she answer
apa ni merepek nak balik ah which is funny lah
macam gitu lah
what's your name how many children you have lepas tu dia tanya
all the personal things lah then tanya
um past then present then tanya in between so
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up lah so she macam ada rest and then after that continue again um
ya but the progression is like um the progression is actually macam okay lah people
um which macam mana nak cakap eh ah depression lah maybe lah
difficult for me to say lah because it involved brain and then like nenek they said that some of her brains already stroke
educate the caregiver itu lah
because dia orang ni sooner or later they going to be
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say ah eh I thought you want to err pass motion or you want to kencing and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that um
um professional ataupun ah
nurses yang
well educate about all this macam well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is err no the better lah no way I'm quite difficult lah this this this this dementia or old aging punya err problem eh it's going to hit the world
the youngsters educate the youngsters ataupun macam make it a point that
or anak mesti nak kena jaga parents atau there is this centre ataupun help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
kita kena ada this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
eh tak baik say dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik say tak nak jaga mak bapa dia
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that macam kita nak abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say eh tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that ataupun european europe country atau the america they find that sending the
dalam islam okay kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan a must
kind of macam err educate ataupun information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
macam preparation for the future for the future or
I think so because but mm but I don't think so they take nowadays they dia orang macam tak encouraged but they are
they have this macam mana nak cakap eh dia tak encourage tapi dia dah dah ready
I did in this ah they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you dah tua you tak nak tinggal dengan anak you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a um estate where a lot of amenities macam vast or or supermarket doctors dekat dekat and then err the whole building dia orang pun ada macam err
how should I say macam dia orang ada
clubhouse lah something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but dia orang tak macam
macam apa eh
have campaign ataupun macam kasih
tahu dengan public no they just do it you want it
okay this uh we have it you know tapi dia tak ada encouragement ataupun dia kasih macam I find lah macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
an idea ataupun dia come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system mah
they don't they they say said very err how should I say uh tak macam besar tau like very big macam siapa tahu tahu lah siapa tak tahu tak tahu lah that kind of thing
so it's kind of like macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu
then they are they are well informed otherwise takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang be bothered takde orang tahu lah um that's the problem lah
kita tak macam based we are free religious
other activity macam ah more of entertainment entertainment and activity lah you know of ataupun
old folk citizen soon or not far also but err right now people at my age I should say ataupun people at pak age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
atau plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both ada compromise both boleh plan sama-sama and both also boleh you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
oh what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the dah tak boleh juga
I kena orang then I know I don't want to burden my children um
kau orang share cari orang jaga mak that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday ah one of my children must visit me ah macam gitu lah
ah ataupun nanti cuti come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a macam sekarang ni eh banyak karang ni I see like macam my girlfriends
are people that I know ah they have mom which go every week go to every are of err anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu I I don't know whether is it a good idea because mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin is it
oh at this stage eh dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit is it good for her to change
the second option is so much better because dia tak ada burden others because you see ah
anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul ah children wants to but you must also remember anak-anak not the spouse ada anak I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then um anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya
peace also it's like um mak ni macam jadi macam you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you faham tak
unless you macam okay let's see lah this is
ah what I think it's good it's like macam let's say I ada empat anak I ada dua belas cucu something like that dua belas cucu enam yang very um macam dah secondary school ataupun dah pergi tertiary you know which they can help
you know so empat plus enam sepuluh sepuluh ni take turn lah take turns to um go to grandma house to this err monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then err this day to this day okay mak pula yang kena tinggal sana
ah macam take care out dia orang ada ni eh ada helpers twenty four seven dekat dalam rumah tapi err macam make sure stay duduk makan tengokkan dia the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be lah
rather than err kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis I rasa macam gitu lagi better lah emak yang in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
monday and thursday my turn okay dia ni wednesday and friday dia ni so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
other elderly parents so um I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in mak nenek into one station the rest all have to rotate lor whether dementia ke tak dementia ke pun rotate
oh maybe macam cik rosnah lah cik rosnah punya mak lah dia kan macam tu satu place when maid with with the helper than everybody come cik rosnah come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then err also so cute then they have this like macam caregiver punya holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then anak-anak lain have to sit take care
um so macam gitu lah macam pada mak lah better mak that way lor I don't know
lah you got a point there also lah it's what you say tapi kalau sebelum dia orang could are given a task kita kena educate lah the main thing here the the the role model is very important
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them macam kita tak boleh
um macam alamak this week I cannot lah I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go eh I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to um macam kita kena tunjuk positif that kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment oh I can't
ya true sebab masa tu nenek okay
but sekarang ni
tak boleh lah sekarang nenek have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is kuat takpe that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul because dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan
you know kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one nak cuba cuba calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
siapa yang tak marah even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
party must come out kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun ah ikat orang tua um macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid itu yang buat
um banyak terjadi didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this lah because nenek is actually educating me you know
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna macam sakit ke macam um
bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak lah banyak lah kalau lah sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan um
punya punya apa mental mental punya
our readiness oh mesti nak kuat
ya really last time I people always says ah tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I geram sangat ke then what is syurga
macam tu I can't even reach syurga if I do this to my mum
I take care of her not because I want syurga I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to macam
I she's get she got annoyed her you know ataupun you know I tak boleh tahan dengan dia then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
ah ya that's why I said because I cakap I dapat awareness ah so it's something that macam god is given me awareness oh okay this is what you need to do lah that I need I can plan compared
ah twenty four seven take care of punya
orang tua and then they they they now I have ah ah macam my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard atau by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to macam mana nak cakap eh a process of being young and then adult and then old
is everybody have to go through tak semestinya aku beranak kau kau kena take care of me somebody else can take care of me right not ah tu lah kadang bila mak fikir
err macam knowledge macam pergi macam I pergi universiti lepas tu I graduate you know I'm graduated where where I in his life experience that I have to go through no if if I were to given a chance to give um macam
a talk atau macam kasih volunteer atau told people or need help atau need advice I think I have
ya lah you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing ah technician go machine you know macam mana machine
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion dia orang emotional dia orang is so complex that we
don't know ah macam mana professional you are a good ah
it you'd secretaries apa ke all of them based on experience or dia orang punya client punya patients punya experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because dia tak dapat
dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay kita kasih penat tapi tetap keep on scream bukan itu dia tak suka ah dia scream sebab sakit perut you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being dia macam twins lah twins muka sama everything sama tapi tetap perangai lain
her likes and dislikes you know the err for the professional we bring it to the they I just uh based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event dia orang punya
err other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional pun mesti ada family members pun mesti ada and then um very important lah
oh so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the macam
ah apa they call it err
makan ya
ah nevermind just like grandma lah tak tahu macam mana nak bilang actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say nak keluar tak boleh tidur
you know she said ah mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa and then when we stopped her from going out the she said mak nak kencing
there's a oh sebenarnya nak kencing eh ah then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after kencing you tidur okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
err so sometimes kat dalam bilik pun sama and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place atau bilik is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
oh bilik dia sejuk lah kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar she keep on saying nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar then we keep asking why nak keluar then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us ah only if she could tell mak nak keluar because ah bilik ni gelap lah bilik ni sejuk ah okay kita tidur kat luar that will be much
true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers dia dah penuh um
susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada some ah
crack ataupun ulcer ataupun sakit perut I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process ah cuma baby it get get baby kita kita jaga macam dia punya journey is to be independent ah kalau old folks kita jaga needed is to be dependent
it looks quite interesting lah I think kita should pergi like
err I think ada banyak ah ada tom yum ada
macam-macam lah a lot lah I mean we can just go there and see it's quite affordable also
pun ada dia macam steamboat then macam ada tempat you can masak macam apa ni hotplate eh something they call it
hotplate pun ada macam-macam lah
and kita nak tukar to andes pun boleh
biasa lah melayu kan suka barbeque
adam maybe kalau adam nak
so macam okay so because hafizah also tengah tidur sekarang so I also don't know whether dia nak ke tak
car lite I think a bit mahal because weekend then must top up petrol some more
oh tak tahu lah maybe dia letak air kat dalam
oh belum masih dalam bag dalam bag hafizah
ya betul betul actually kita boleh makan kat ni garden you want or not
mm ada fifty percent
mm selain daripada dining in garden apa lagi ada
I mean ya kita boleh ada alternative kat sana banyak alternative
oh jom ah kita pergi sedap mania
kalau tak pergi sadap mania pergi mana
katakan adam tak ikut
boleh lah
ya I mean apa tu okay lah kalau nak kita pergi cuba so our trip can be from
you know maybe bau jer sedap mania habis tu kita nak bicycle
tengok jurassic meyer habis kita makan jinjja chicken tapi kan that time I went to jewel um
uh ahad punya malam
so um the queue ah panjang ah lepas tu tempat dia duduk kena like they put us in front of the entrance so it was very awkward lah duduk kat depan orang nak lalu-lalang lalu lintas so
I tak tahu lah apa tu um macam mana begitu but
ya like singapore memang got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated punya food places ah the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about A&W baru halal kan
dekat jewel pun ada
kita kan nak pergi cycling
ya true also tapi tak boleh cycling
not really sure I think macam crab meat
shiitake cendawan shiitake
ya memang yummy
hari ini cheat day
K ya so macam mana
bukan B B nine eh
bukan eh
um K boleh ah
ke cakap pasal shares lah
I nak try lah baru try try I nak try stock then I macam rasa-rasanya tesla will grow lah in the future
sebab ya because a lot of countries are macam adopting err are banning petrol vehicles by
by investing in macam electric car company ini kan all those clean energy ones
the shares would probably go up lah in the future like maybe not now maybe dalam lima sepuluh tahun
macam bitcoin dulu lah bitcoin dulu also low kan but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance tapi I think like macam those stocks yang
yang permissible macam you know yang tak go against the basic purpose ah macam those thoughts yang deal with um vices then
you know all those macam clearly apa ni
that's my pandangan lah on this
okay for me eh I think kita kena macam
diversify lah our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like macam
uh wahed invest so this is a macam
only macam
syariah compliant punya stocks trading platform lah so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
commodities ah macam cash ke gold
ambil bonds and all these are like certified to be syariah compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in macam these kind of companies
you don't have to put in effort lah you just letak your money then you just
based on my experience dia punya fees is
tapi like maybe this is one
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms yang offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
maybe you can feedback to jangan invest in bonds
macam bank bapa kita
oh like betul lah I mean yang what you say is true cuma
I mean you want apa ethical investing eh in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
those the regular accounts lah me you have no choice what tapi that's why err you have to do your own research lah if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
err mana-mana company I mean mana-mana banks
cakap pasal investment ni macam mana kita punya trip ni
so dia punya kentut signify more to yes ke more to no
kita err
I think she I mean she's free lah it's whether dia nak ke tak
ya maybe dia malas lah tapi anyway dia dah agree apa sunday dia okay
ya mahal sikit ah situ
ubin mana makcik punya
boleh actually boleh tapi semua orang kena okay lah
besok tak crowded
oh so kita dah dah missed lah
unless kita pergi besok
kita pergi terus pergi ubin
oh ya tak nak
any lah islands or whatever sisters' islands ke batu ke bukit
eh itu jangan cuba I I okay punya
I pakai my army boot steady
we can okay lah listen to it later lah takkan nak busuk busuk semua but I mean take the car car lite lah car lite maybe we go in the day

how about those yang tinggal kat at risk blocks
boon keng eh boon keng ada ke at risk block
oh ya I heard also from my uncles because dia orang cakap dia punya kawan pun tinggal sana semua residents
ya pernah
oh I tell you just story lah ya of course lah I mean yang paling err famous is their macam a lot of drug addicts lah kat sana
err let kejap ah apa nama dia
jauh jauh jauh lah I think ah dia tinggal boon keng jauh
oh okay lah lame oh nama dia uh
nama okay lah I shouldn't cakap nama lah pasal tak baik kan kita expose orang I should just panggil dia Q lah
no lah it's one of my relatives lah dia quite kesian lah so
oh so macam ya dia dia tinggal dengan mak dia then dengan datuk dia
oh datuk dia ah
boleh lah datuk dia close juga lah tak close lah pernah jumpa lah like visit
so okay lah cuma kesian lah dia seorang kat rumah dia takde adik beradik kan then mak dia mak dia doctor actually
I'm not sure tapi I think dia general practitioner lah I don't think that specialize in anything
tapi maybe eh if I'm not wrong dia specialise in psychology
boleh lah
dia kawan doctor dia kawan police
vet tak
betul betul I think you didn't mothership ke bukan mother's gossip
ya I think betul lah I mean like kesian juga ah like people look down right all these people tapi in actual fact right you put any human being in that kind of
environment ah I'm talking about the block eh bukan the orang-orang lah block lah you put in that kind of block macam lonely kan takde family I mean takde support adik-beradik so any human being will also macam experience something will experience the same thing lah

ya but anyway adik ipar dia meninggal bro
oh about the banjir oh then pramugara buka kedai it was quite fun ah actually when we were watching it
kan macam so juicy
besok thursday eh
you rasa apa jadi
pasal there was there was one part at the end where he carried the baby a newborn baby
lily give birth with seluar
then I thought ushu will kahwin the
ya so complicated and technically he already lafaz cerai
when he said that no he put a syarat he said that if you go and see your father
I will ceraikan you remember
he pull back the cerai is it that's what
because talak will jatuh as long as your syarat is tunai technically dia punya syarat dah tertunai tau pasal dia cakap macam gitu he said kalau what did he say ah something like kalau
you jumpa kalau engkau jumpa bapak kau
apa aku cerai apa aku eh macam mana eh
no lah cuma I tahu kalau macam benda gini you kena consult ustaz because ni fasakh
ya but ya but to be safe if let's say the talak dah jatuh then you have to just reconcile lah and say aku nikah dengan you know you have to lafaz it back eh no need to lafaz it back but you have to do it with a saksi something like that ah meaning you still have to report it yes I'm very sure
that's why yang that time ija ibu dengan ayah he lafaz it right then they already back together what because mubin kept on pestering them back as long as the talak dah jatuh they cannot be in the same room already because they are considered cerai and they have to immediately consult
ustaz or as in like ah
then over there within forty days if you reconcile you don't need to angkat nikah back again
arwah mak long and pak long is cerai cerai dude
kan he already cerai her kan twenty sixteen kan kita kahwin kan ada satu gambar mak long tak ada
ingat tak then mak long tengah ambil gambar dengan kita and then suddenly pak long say ah okay okay kita then he asked mak long to walk away then I was just there like wah that's mean
kawan I satu mengandung then she complained kat twitter dia cakap yang every time kalau part dia share good news dengan family dia mesti dia orang ingatkan kakak dia macam kesian eh
meaning like like kakak dia takde tak boleh ada anak so dia selalu ada anak apa so as in as much as it is not her first child it is still a child what as in it's still a good
uh doa-doa kakak kau ah yang mengandung you know
no uh ya tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah
tak pasal abang elfi dia nak beli rumah nenek then nenek is like saying you know
obviously he's gonna nenek still staying with mama
ya lah he's gonna buy it from pak busu
pak busu bought it at hundred thousandish cheap ah so unfair ah
I pun tak tahu why ya
dia nak hantar anak dia yes so now he's grand master plan is five years he have to immediately sell so next year kan anak dia so two years ya so
tu yang tadi one of the parents say
alah dia sihat for the next few years jer dah happy
apa you nak cakap tadi
kan I dah lupa
ni ah nanti lepas ni I treat you to
dalgona kalau tak tidur
I layan ah
no I layan you ah tak tidur
a'ah seh I want to watch more than family seh dah dua hari
dude you lagi into the drama than I am seh cantik eh dia tapi macam flawless
kamal adli macam very like
that's true ah and then meletop I think that was what they talking about like they wanted
ya lah dua ribu dua puluh we are all in lockdown like the whole year gone
kan tu lah masalahnya
semua resolution pun dah tak tercapai semuanya
err of course first of all I have to make sure that I redo back everything yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye lah cakap pasal redo back everything sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada I would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight lah memang nak nak turunkan berat badan lah harap harapnya macam tu tahun target eh
this year target nya lebih kurang dalam maybe fifteen ya
serious ah sihat ke kalau macam tu
oh I cannot do the skipping sebab dengan spine issue lah so macam kalau skipping nanti patah pula tulang belakang so I don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
tu lah
ya achievable so I would say that kalau fifteen maksudnya dalam sebulan kena target at least two lah
tapi tapi sebenarnya one half pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu lah lebih kurang
ya so that's another thing lah pasal vegetarian kan macam ya before this sebab baru adapt to vegetarian so banyak makan processed food lah
actually adapt tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi I would say I ate a lot of
like man man-made meat macam tu kan sebenarnya tak boleh so I was thinking of this year kalau boleh nak jadi vegetarian and grow my own food like tanam sayur ataupun tanam
tanam sayur lah basically kita orang dah tanam benda lain kan macam tu lah anyway
ya how about you how about you what is what is your resolution untuk tahun ni
for business apa lah apa apa the idea business yang dah ada buat masa ni
I see surprise delivery menarik
I see so the surprise part lah yang betul-betul make meaningful
I see so macam mana sebelum delivery ni dia akan ada macam set set dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh customise ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu
okay faham
so basically ni macam err macam bukan professional dia macam lebih kurang special customisation lah
okay tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam uh food based ke ataupun
oh okay lah okay maksudnya dah ada customer ah
oh wow ya ya ya ya sebab ya lah sekarang ni orang pun suka eh macam boleh pergi surprise delivery lepas tu boleh hantar eh boleh share dekat Insta kan macam tu lah
I see interesting it's interesting so apa lah nama the surprise delivery service ni apa nama dia
oh wow okay kotak riang so kotak riang basically like macam gift uh box of happiness lah box of happiness
okay okay okay betul betul new year resolution lah
so what do you have for now ada tak benda-benda yang ya it's still give you some happiness in the world tapi healthy lah
I see tapi sugar free how is that achievable even
menarik menarik so err healthy diet healthy food
basically ya lah macam kita pun tengok kan dengan COVID punya issue I think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the COVID issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat kan ah so ya penting lah very very important lah untuk
tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah when you get rich I will be the first person yang you have to belanja lah kan aduhai
oh resolution lain apart from losing weight I would say that okay lah dia macam satu we have to look at the whole system lah kan I started with trying to eat
healthily kan I want to err I want to lose weight so I have to live live err I have to eat healthily so I want to grow my own food the idea is not just kita nak kurangkan berat badan is also because I want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet kan most of the thing yang you beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak tau
especially sayur lah macam tu kan jadi macam I was thinking of and kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam supermarket
kan so we didn't know pun macam kita opt untuk healthily tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat so I was thinking of like okay with after I grow my own food I will save more money and I want to make sure that I can pay off all the debt because somehow ya lah mm kita tahu economically macam mana
macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar with the with the vaccine of COVID nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so I was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya sekarang ni ramai juga kan orang monetise daripada YouTube kan and then ya betul betul and because we provide the content YouTube is open platform anyway
betul betul okay ya interesting I should think about it should think about it ya macam
orang kata tanam jer lah tapi sebenarnya nak tanam pun ada cara kan ya ya ya
ya interesting hmm okay boleh boleh masuk dalam resolutions seterusnya okay
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so cakap pasal healthy and rich kan kalau lah you nak sum up lah the the I the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word lah apa you punya apa one word yang will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
wow oh okay alright alright maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni the the timeline the the stories not good yang you need the plot twist
untuk diri sendiri eh
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person macam it ya maybe with better networking kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh bring it forward kan ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one I would say that I would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one I want is kind
because I I want to be kinder to myself lah I would say that two thousand twenty dengan COVID dan sebagainya it has been very harsh and I blame myself I critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
tak jadi apa-apa pun so I was thinking okay I want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the kind to the world lah like environmentally more friendly lah
okay apa lagi takkan tu jer apa lagi share lah resolution
mmhmm what what kind of me time like pergi bowling macam tu
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill yang you dah ada and then you want to enhance ataupun like new skill
ya I still remember like your one of your ambition is like jadi ya jadi pemain guitar oh my god
ah okay ya masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama I didn't really update
but but somehow piano like ini dua benda yang berbeza tau mostly guitar punya song it's like metal you know very hard one piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it juga makin besar makin matang you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
I see so with before this kak long pernah juga ada idea macam nak enroll class tau and of course I want to also look into yang macam elegant elegant ni lah kan cuma kenapa bukan piano sebab piano requires some set up lah then tak dapat berlatih kat rumah kan macam tu so I was thinking of beli ukulele ke violin something like that lah so macam at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you kan kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak wind punya apa ni punya instruments you need a whole band baru dia akan menjadi or you main trumpet sorang-sorang macam ni lah dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan Spongebob I don't remember the name Squidward tu clarinet that's clarinet so it will
ah Squidward kan so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it lah macam tu
interesting okay lah basically kan macam kita boleh tengok kan sometime our education system
focus on more maths science tapi kan art art is very important human very connected to any beautiful things be it the beautiful things tu dalam bentuk visual ataupun audio lah macam music kan because somehow that makes us
err be more empathy kan dan buat kita more human lah and in your own case kan macam memang buat hard science buat maths kan err
at the end you will turn to robot lah if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you macam tu kan okay so piano so that's the skill yang basically dream lah belum belum start ah do you have any skill yang just you want to enhance lah yang you dah ada dah ada base base[lah
ataupun something lah selain daripada skill err musical skill ada skill lain tak
but mandarin is kinda hard though because tak silap mandarin kan dia ada macam empat
empat macam apa eh apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi something you know
ya that's the thing sebab basically ya bila kita boleh connect to to a person dengan dia punya mother tongue it will be lebih ni lah kan
ya ya lagipun kita pun multi racial I think it's best untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga kan betul betul interesting interesting
so okay buat masa sekarang how many language you know like even it's amateur pun tak faham how many I will say malay english arabic okay interesting japanese
korea korea daripada mana because you watch oh my god alright alright
so many language cakap pasal korea I watch a very very good good drama I'm not sure you have watched it or not tapi dia berkaitan dengan business lah since you pun nak buat business kan
ya cerita tu menarik tau because dia menunjukkan macam mana yes
so orang selalu tengok kan orang business ni at at the end of the success tau like the only the tip of the iceberg lah when ya and then macam kita pun jealous lah bila dia lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
even though macam belum kaya lagi but there every single day I woke up
even though I would say that sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi it's interesting and I would say that the in the in the drama itself benda yang paling belajar is you need a good mentor
macam bila you bila you dah kaya ramai jer orang yang akan datang kan berpusu-pusu tapi basically kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul care ataupun just nak ride on us macam tu kan
ya that's the thing so cakap pasal tak kaya tapi means a lot sebab
my business is operating on different model which is I choose a social enterprise basically the business itself adalah untuk selesaikan social issues like
ikut lah issue nya about environmental ke apa kan so because I do believe that in the in the in the keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan
kita perlukan orang buat business untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work lah kita pun tahu politician have so many other things kan tapi I would say that business kita boleh provide like kita boleh provide ya macam cakap lah kerja untuk orang kan kita boleh provide service diorang macam in your case you nak buat surprise delivery kan you boleh make people happy and so I would say that
instead of ya lah I used to work juga dulu kan dengan boss boss bukannya senang kan kita salah pun
kita salah memang confirm salah kita betul pun kita salah kan jadi macam ya but but it's okay I think that's the beauty of young age lah untuk
try error jatuh explore ya explore
jangan jangan berhenti terlalu cepat sometimes you didn't know macam awak tengok kan business business yang dah berjaya
that take years then even just take even one to two years lah yang one to two years ni bukannya entrepreneur dia grant-preneur sebab dia dapat duit daripada grant kan macam tu lah
tapi basically kan err orang perlukan at least six seven years untuk dia betul-betul ada strong base kan so if you stop too early
macam let's say kita nak makan durian kan even though we already see the buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita ambik pokok durian kan kita sibuk nak makan durian nak makan durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit kan it's not going to taste good even though you nampak hari-hari tapi you kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri
tapi the the biggest thing ialah perseverance untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening kan tapi
what kenapa apa what what what was
oh so itu adalah interesting part I would say that
he is a good actor tau so basically err sebenarnya kan bagus jer cerita start up ni walaupun dia letak satu lead actor yang teruk gila tapi basically dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang
lead actor pun dah terlalu superficial tau macam terlalu hebat so sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda
so walaupun awak tak tengok character nam do san tu sangat-sangat loser kan tapi basically that's how people at twenties macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu
compare to someone yang dah macam han ji pyeong yang dah thirties tau
so tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang production ni pun tak sangka dia akan backfire macam ni
sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada synopsis kan ada seorang mentor yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat han ji pyeong tapi because he is a good actor himself yang membuatkan
kita move dengan perasaan dia sampai kita sedangkan character tu tanpa tanpa interpretation daripada dia kan mungkin akan jadi character yang sangat annoying
harsh lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi because err the actor himself kan put so many emotions on the face
aiya many conflicts err conflicting emotions yang kita tahu yang he is not bad he is just
err mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati lah tapi when I think back and if I am mad at nam do san I would say that I'm mad at younger me juga
nonton suka hati kita lah kita nak suka siapa kan that is our own right tapi I would say it's a good reflection lah it's a good reflection
three years pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus that's the thing
sebab yang lain ada character development tau the other two friends tapi yang tu macam stay like just like that
ya just just better sikit lah ada coat sendiri tak payah pinjam that's the only improvement made kan kan tu lah aduh
okay ada lagi ke resolution untuk tahun ni anything eh untuk tahun ni
eh small thing seh yang buat benda jadi great and big ya
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya lah macam zaman study I would say that I I'm a last minute person because last minute kadang-kadang boleh push you
like push you lah macam in the very last minute kan you boleh focus and sometimes your creative juice like macam tu kan tapi masalahnya in real life kan when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as err persekitaran lah environment macam tiba-tiba COVID dan sebagainya kan so macam
procrastination akan backfire you compare to someone belajar yang it's just you and your assignment lah macam tu kan
maybe because you are a person yang work under pressure
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you kena you kena combine kerja you dengan team mate lain like just imagine if the team mate buat macam tu to you kan at the last day baru dia nak submit dia punya
drag yourself ya betul betul betul procrastination
and somehow sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa lah procrastination ni pun
sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya social media juga kan macam in my own case lah I will say sometimes I was like okay I just want to watch one video kan tiba-tiba another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so itu yang menarik then tu lah tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu kan ada tengok satu documentary tau dekat
documentary dekat Netflix ah cerita pasal social network tau macam mana sebenarnya since since kita guna all this services for free kan macam Facebook and all those thing kan basically we are
pelik ah sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah customer kan tapi kita tak bayar so tu maksudnya kita bukan customer maksudnya kita adalah
data err their their modal macam tu kan so
so dia dah baca tau kita punya behaviour dia dah baca kita punya interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so macam dia tahu macam mana nak keep us hook kita tengok one lepas satu-satu kan lagi satu aduh lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar
macam fikir fikir contoh kata oh rasa nak beli katil ah tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar
so I don't know I mean they were listening to us lah kan our microphone is always on kita tak pernah pun default untuk tutup kan somehow
ya tapi maksudnya ya maksudnya kalau lah basically okay kalau diorang dengar diorang just feed us dengan ads okay lah tetap okay juga lah sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli kan but how about if bad people
so tu lah macam bila kita bila kita gunakan service ni for free kan for free
so kita basically menjual diri kita to them lah like okay I am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me sebab tu penting kita baca like agreements and all term and condition
macam tu lah like term and condition if you agree tick siapa pun nak baca tick kan kat situ that that's the thing
tapi takpe lah basically the basically the idea is walaupun kita tahu yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku at least kita tahu dia ambil so at least kita boleh jaga-jaga lah more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things kan macam tu
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now macam dulu kan like ten years back kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa that is something like ridiculously happened tau macam
kan kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita uh cik boleh tak saya tengok
err saya nak tengok apa periuk err dapur macam mana ada hood ke tak ada hood uh ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of of other person kan because that person boleh buat live dekat dia punya
bilik kan macam tu
ya ya even oh my god I still remember like one house tour that I watched dia siap tunjuk the secret room
and basically kan senangnya sekarang ni with the technology ada the semua kan dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik your plan house plan tau
hanya dengan gambar sekarang pun technology yang ada with with pictures you take pictures you can even like kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then macam nak masuk pun senang
yes and somehow this wealthy people pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan post so orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya rule dalam kita post social media ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh post pasal vacation after the vacation
yes sebab basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then curi lah apa saja
itu lah dunia sekarang different lah people
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing tau macam orang dulu kan dia communication nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu jer lah masa untuk interact tau so you really have to all out kan tapi people nowadays kan dia neglect
organik punya communication tapi dia boleh share every single thing about dia punya life kan tapi bila orang judge dia marah pula
orang tak like tak tak tak bagi reactions pun dia marah kan so
so okay cakap pasal tu that's there's one more lah one more thing I want to add on the twenty twenty resolution lah twenty twenty one oh my god twenty twenty one because I want to segment my day tau macam
I realise that throughout the day there are so many times I check my phone and check my phone tau so I was like macam I want to segment lah macam okay pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically kadang-kadang check tu actually in notification and an hour and I watch hundred videos already
ya and then macam then all the video sometimes is err ridiculous err like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness kan so macam
so I want to segment lah macam okay dalam masa tiga jam ni I will I will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest I would stay out of it macam tu lah that's the idea
macam quota ah
oh you can ignore lah dia tak macam parental parental control yang terus off oh okay okay
just just to remind you lah bukan lah macam guru discipline something like that kan
tapi ada apps tau untuk buat benda tu which is very interesting I just download it lah macam nama dia forest tau so macam bila you start the apps kan you kena set lah you nak you nak buat kerja berapa lama
okay so dia ada beza tau tiga puluh minit dia punya shrub jer kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok tau kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah tau
so basically kan dia untuk bantu you untuk err focus so you buka app you set tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja kan so you tak boleh buka apps lain you kena tutup dengan apps tu sahaja
kalau lah tiga puluh minit you access your phone pokok tu akan mati tau tapi kalau kalau you kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan notify you okay pokok tu dah hidup and basically everyday you have a patch of forest untuk dibangunkan
yes very interesting so macam ah so macam basically kan dia bagi kita award macam dia bagi reward lah reward macam
okay so kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian
tak so depress
a'ah maksudnya
betul sebab manusia ni sukakan acknowledgement tapi takkan kita nak suruh ya yes
takkan kita nak suruh mak kita kata tahniah empat jam kan it's just like boss datang okay congratulations four hours kan tak logic ah kan
that's very intriguing seh tu satu benda forest ada satu lagi tau interesting juga nama dia sleepy town so apa yang kita buat adalah err kita set lah satu hari kita nak tidur dalam enam jam kan so bila nak tidur kita buka apps tu dan tutup phone dengan apps tu on on running lah okay
so kalau you bangun dalam masa you dapat tidur tujuh jam ataupun you pasal you tak access phone dah lepas you dah set the alarm kan you akan bina the town
sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping lah so you will enjoy it when you so dia lebih daripada quality life lah so macam
interesting I ya lah saja jer nak tengok apps I've seen because I want to live better I want to have a balance between sleep
sometimes I already sleep tau tapi bila bangun terus nak tengok phone sebab nak tengok sekejap jer end up kan
mula-mula jer yes end up Netflix tiba-tiba kan tiba-tiba so basically dia memang dia memang ada design untuk bagi orang hook
and tapi kita kena take back the power lah we have to unhook all that
ya yang peliknya dia bukan macam puppy tau yang macam memang sentiasa entertain anyone dia diva and then macam
make macam sangat-sangat annoying ah macam if if I need you rub me rub me now and when I don't like it I will just leave you macam tu kan
tu lah orang cakap kan macam bila kita bela kucing kita yang jadi servant to the cat
I think because they are cute tapi elegant
they they keep their eh I know tak lah macam cara dia tidur you know then oh tapi tak juga
tapi tapi ya cats can be very then sekarang ramai orang dah mula macam
ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang instead of bela anak kan maybe sebab bela binatang lebih bagus lah kot dari bela anak kan sebab bela anak ni
yeah maybe sometimes diorang investment so
macam tu lah
oh my god zombie apocalypse tapi agaknya okay lah ya zombie apocalypse tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa
I don't know I I have seen the video people cakap the science or some drugs can make you like that I don't know lah tapi I would say apocalypse akan berlaku so be it zombie or not but still ah kata lah kalau that's why that's the thing I've been reading about bunkers tau macam menarik ah orang yang boleh buat bunkers kat bawah rumah kan macam tu because you want to save save your family lah at least and sebab
tak payah tak payah zombie lah apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada food ration
and then at least ada survival skill kan let's say lah kalau berlaku
disasters kan actually zombie apocalypse akan leads kepada disaster ah dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah ah kan dan sebagainya kan so um kita kena ada survival skill
let's say kalau macam mana kita nak um menyorok kat mana kan ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab ya lah so far nak cakap pasal zombie ni kita tak tahu zombie tu macam mana
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see kan can only err listen ah macam tu kan so tak tahu cuma I would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared lah kan
let's say kalau zombie semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang kan so kita kena
ah duduk dalam air kan betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air at least kita kena basic macam rafting ke apa macam tu kan
ya it's not zombie ah we call it bunk out bag dia macam
err bag tu ada cukup lah untuk something happened ada macam first aid macam ada dry food and then macam err your details pasal you punya your blood semua kan so macam kalau orang jumpa you terbaring ke apa you ni tapi kita panggil bunk out bag lah macam tu ya but kalau kalau kita cakap zombie kit tu orang akan rasa oh it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie kan but actually err disclaimer sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja jer lah it don't have to be zombie let's say lah kalau ada orang masuk rumah you yes war we don't we never know kan macam even though kita rasa everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year yang buatkan apa pun kita punya resolution tak tercapai tu kan so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so mmhmm
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it lah so macam tak tahu lah kalau macam overseas kan orang akan macam ada kan non disclosure kan macam tu tapi macam
I would say that berapa berapa probability dan possibility dia ah then macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya contractor tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana kan so macam boleh berlaku tapi I would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous lah sebab maybe ah kan macam for now I would say that if we pun orang akan rasa oh this for safety
but for people yang macam influential kan let's say say it's um
ya kalau dalam movie kalau macam mafia ni kalau orang tu buat bunker untuk dia dia tembak jer lepas tu kan ah of course lah we cannot do that kan
cakap pasal rumah it's very interesting kan how ya people try to customise house kan macam buat secret room macam buat bunker and now people sekarang macam buat apa catio untuk kucing lah eh macam buat hub ya
cat is like social media ah hook you kan macam tu
and make them you know that's the thing err we call it like cat nourishment ah macam cats used to live in the wild tapi kita yang bring in the home kan so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is kejar rama-rama
things like that kan so that is tapi kalau ada rumah the first thing I want to have is swimming pool lah
seriously you want to hi and things waktu swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least bukan semua baka lah maybe some some breed can lah macam I would say bengal ke apa yang yang very wild one kan tapi basically kalau perasan semua kucing berenang most of them adalah yang short hair
ya instead of long hair ah macam tu sebab so kalau long hair I would say it would be very very very wet and then tak dapat macam wiggle wiggle badan dia how dogs do it kan
ya it's very interesting and then I want to have like place untuk macam
buat yoga with all the sun you know because somehow kan kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then kita most of the time stay at home working at home and everything because of the COVID
we have less exposure of vitamin D tau but because vitamin D we can only get it from sunlight kan so I was thinking kalau ada rumah kan in the middle of the house I want to make sure the dia punya dinding tu
um made from glass no no made from glass so dia dia dia
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight macam tu
like buat like igloo style so macam dok macam macam ni lah kubah macam tu
ya the remaining is always nice and I think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive lah kan macam during this trying time kan macam ya every new year pun kita buat resolution kan pastu kita buat plans and everything because we want to look forward in life lah
macam and most of dreamers pun orang rasa macam crazy people in the beginning kan macam
macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik wright kan the the the wright brothers kan
macam when they want to fly things siapa jer yang setuju
tapi now that is diorang punya determination tu yang membuat we can cross country kan kita boleh experience things on the other side of the world
betul I would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected lah dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat heavily affected
sebab ya lah diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak operate kan
oh tak boleh langsung ya then most people yang kerja dalam industry tu diorang adalah macam skillful people tapi in one area tau so diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain
ya that's interesting like paramedics pun boleh kan macam tu like basic basic ah menarik menarik so ya lah macam
because senang kan bila orang kena lay off ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena lay off sekarang sangat
dan somehow apart from dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan industry revolution industry kan bila everything's automated semua benda pakai robot pasal dia akan take away our jobs kan tiba-tiba kita berlaku economic punya macam ni yang yang merudum kan so
sebab itu lah kita buat business kot kan boleh lah bantu orang maybe provide more jobs to people kan sebab the economy have to run lah
ya because somehow dengan ramai orang kena laid off employer pun ada banyak sangat pilihan so the competition is very very high
macam tu kan
and cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada business kan lah
I would say that kesan besar kepada education system juga lah kan macam kids nowadays I would say sometimes bagus juga sebab orang dah mula adopt online learning sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan interactions
dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam universities kan some universities are err fully err fully on online platform kan
tapi bila kita dekat university kita bukannya hanya belajar theory dan kita punya subject tapi life lesson macam
kita belajar communicate kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi kan so all that adalah very important life skills so I am so into online learning I I really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some sometime boleh juga bagi tapi I don't know how much the impact will be towards the character building
ya betul betul ya
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose kan tapi friends adalah orang yang you boleh choose ya kan so macam
you boleh choose and and boleh align minat dan sebagainya kan compare to ni then ya lah macam same eh macam peer kan macam same age peer sangat sangat penting untuk kita associate untuk kita faham
dan sebagainya so
ya akan jadi ada impact yang besar lah kepada characters building macam tu
ya just imagine before this pun graduates susah nak dapat kerja because
it's a very competitive market kan and now kita ada so many
err talented people kena laid off and compete together with them
ya macam dah lah nak compete each other pun dah hard enough and then kena compete lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun experience it's not going to be easy
tapi new economy pun akan terbuka lah macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi influencer kan sebab ya like influencer pun boleh give money
dah lama kan
cuma bahaya dengan being influencer ni sometimes they are not being human tau macam
and they ya and diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu social status yang sometimes unachievable kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar kan untuk bagi nampak abs nampak kurus sometimes it's just about angle
then people yang see that they didn't know pun itu adalah angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that sedangkan all that is just an illusion is a it is just an different angle kan camera trick that's the thing sometimes
dah lah tu lah jadi lebih mencabar lah kat kita punya youth kalau keadaan macam ni ya lah lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
ya even big brands pun sekarang dah start to work with influencers instead of artists yang memang buat art tau berkarya
okay lah somehow artist people diorang charge memang terlalu mahal kan and influencers dia ada dia ada bigger fan base
ya faham
dan artist dan actress ni dia terpaksa produce something dulu kan baru orang boleh look up to them kan compared to influencer ni
pergi makan pun orang suka kan pergi jogging pun orang suka kan so macam cuma tu lah kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh set unrealistic thing ah
so fuh banyak juga kita borak ni kan daripada start dengan resolution cerita pasal zombie apocalypse dan sebagainya so ya hopefully takpe lah yang penting kita start sekarang buat sekarang macam
ya boleh
untuk family ah untuk family err I would say that more collaborations macam
ya lah before this I would say that I live on my own lah pun duduk macam jauh kan so macam
I live on my own I just want to achieve my own goal kan tapi I want this family to be more collaborative like masak sama-sama
buat kerja sama-sama and even though macam ya lah adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu you know like sometimes I feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one kan even though of course lah macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah kan tapi basically ah but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
kadang-kadang macam ya lah kita pun kena bergerak sebagai family
betul how about you apa yang you uh foresee for as a family punya movement
aduhai okay lah
ya ya ya hopefully lah macam and it don't have to be far pun but at least places that we can
okay jom rasanya
boleh lah kan kita start put in the planner ataupun buat vision board kan letak dekat dalam semua lawa-lawa kan and satu benda lagi it's good tau actually bila kita tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us lah
ya because when we say it kan tak ada lah nanti at the end takkan lah nanti at the end of the year nanti macam eh apa jadi dengan macam tu kan so macam
the other day I was not other day lah just now I scrolled through tiktok and then ada this girl
dia ada err hanger
dia punya okay hanger usually ada two sides kan

okay so you so you tasted uh before lah orang punya masak ke apa tahu bagedil lah tried it
bila kau start masak masak sebelum ni
so mula mula eh I mean something you wanted to macam um
jual kat kedai lah sell it to a shop first lah is it and then uh
and then delivery macam mana
so then dah berapa lama ni dia kirakan dah macam
so macam mana rasanya boleh buat lagi lama tak boleh sustain tak
then customer macam mana
so ada branding tak
ya lah macam ada nama ke to this tahu begedil what do you call it

okay macam ingatkan dia macam Starbucks gitu
but no lah ah okay okay bagus lah alhamdulillah so you got this business going on and then I heard you also got apa tu yang the selendang business
apa dia punya scholarship
we ni siapa who who you started with
oh okay so korang dua ni macam very entrepreneur eh leh
kira bagus juga they will you try things tapi bawakan
bawakan duit eh bring him bringing in the money so
okay korang save duit untuk apa sebenarnya
bagus lah bagus lah entrepreneur I I'm quite surprised eh it's only quite also and
um nak cakap apa tu heartened lah I'm heartened to see that you are doing this
ya so lepas apa tu
I asked around lah I said how to go for audition right untuk apa ni how to start theatre how to do theatre
eh no no I didn't go audition I attend the workshop first it was a free workshop on sunday kat sub station so then lepas tu ya lah every week I go attend workshop I do I learn about acting
and then apa tu uh one day like uh my first appearance on stage was as a human prop
somehow they get somebody cause kita free kan they get us to just lie there
like in the middle of the show lah before intermission one of the character cakap what the character say macam oh who is this you know then after that reveal lah so like wah a dead body
until the end everybody dah balik
but ya lah because cannot cannot move what so my kaki semut semut you know
but then kaki semut semut you cannot move right so you need to learn macam your breathing and stuff like that
I didn't realise yang how hard it was until um they got a review lah somebody wrote a review then cakap
complain lah they complain banyak banyak about the acting of the other actors or blah blah blah then after that
cakap about the best potrayal was the portrayal
because I was so still they didn't even funny thing bila I think got this one uh kakak melayu
orang rupanya so she was like she was surprised yang she so she was shocked lah to realise actually I was a real person lah so okay
um mula mula so not wrapped ah macam dorang ada cover dengan kain gitu ah
ah no no no no no as in so dia macam apa tu
my there will be a set kan kat belakang tu ada macam ada the table so I I actually so you cannot see half of me lah ya I'm just like top half I was like lying down like that lah so I
so my leg actually boleh lah my leg can move but then err just to but then I make sure not too much so that they couldn't see so that was my first
um then no we were like training what we wanted macam training then after that apa tu um second show I was
stage managing I was helping and then after that um the actor problem lah tak tak selalu tak datang lah apa tu hangover lah blah blah blah then after that the director cakap
there was one rehearsal a lot of people never turn up but then they say okay guys can you just apa tu um can you just
and then my director macam wah I never knew you can act eh so then she text me then say okay then next time um can you take over his role lah because he's very problematic
but simpan tak
actually itu ah what is influencer
ya actually it's true ah that time where I so geram you know pasal apa tu I got I was trying to promote one of the my programs lah when I was doing coordinating work right I was coordinating apa tu um
her Facebook posts one Facebook post and one Instagram post ya and itu pun bukannya dia macam uh she write any oh no
she actually she wrote something but dia punya her posts were so funny because
the after that post is very hard to track whether apa tu yang the
your your press conference eh no press kit no bukan apa
apa lah
your post bukan they put on theirs right
is it like some of the comments dorang cakap apa
mm mm habis
tak tidur ah kau
tu pun kirakan macam apa tau macam branding kan
eh apa tu number
company apa nak buat uh
what have you thought about apa tu your branding about your selling point eh apa ni bising bising
tu lah oi
perlahan-lahan sikit boleh tak ai okay okay okay tak apa um
kecoh lah okay patut boleh quiet tapi dorang semua
company okay you wanted to sell apa tu nak jual buka kedai
can jangan lupa nak kena code switch sikit eh nak kena code switch melayu okay
bagus lah bagus lah so ah it's
selling marketing tu yang paling the difficult at the moment actually nak buat
one person said to me lah nak apa tu kalau nak
nak buat business senang
cuma nak sustain tu ya nak sustain
apa yang orang nak orang pun semua macam very fickle
hmm what do you mean tak faham
orang yang bayar ya
dia punya dia punya sense orbit lah the fashion sense
not bad so siapa yang jual I mean siapa yang buat
where you manufacture you jahit sendiri
pandai mana kau dapat suruh contact contact sebegini
kena ajar juga eh sometimes okay
but from dari kecil from growing up you really wanted to do this ah
apa lah tak apa
engkau memang yes
apa apa yang cons dia
mati cepat in in what sense
apa car crash eh apa uh plane crash
apa apa juga pun kalau dah ajal like what you say lah
no clown doctor is considered doctor okay lah is not is not really but I was a clown doctor so is a um apa doktor badut dorang panggil um
no lah I think growing up I very you cannot decide lah nowadays also I also think about it kita we always ask ask a teacher also right I sometimes I ask the my students very young ones like what
power ranger then I was like okay lah boleh lah power ranger but you know
but at that time I remember what is it you know I wanted to become a dentist pasal my gigi berterabuh
my gigi I think fall down and then uh I all of my front teeth semua macam
hitam tau like pasal I think it it was chipped and then after that ada ada darah stuff like so I got very ugly teeth growing
I think it was because I was sick then I realise ugh you know what if only I can become a doctor and then um I just got the idea from a lot people lah one thing I wanted to become scientist also pasal that time pergi madrasah then after that my ustazah cakap apa
err kalau ada lalat tu kan lalat dah jatuh dekat makanan terus masukkan terus lepas tu gaul
kepak dia tu kan satu one side kepak dia ada uh
what do they call the poison and then or the toxin and then the other punya kepak tu ada
dia punya antidote penawar dia the medicines I want to say who ah I I'm curious ah
which side of the of the kepak of the lalat tu yang mana satu toxic yang mana satu what
because when I was in I was I was so I was always late and then every time I kena punished and I don't like to be punished then everytime before because I know
so dia cakap macam eh macam cool eh korang apa ni what you do performance and I enjoy that lah but I was in science I was in triple science at that time
pasal to get into medicine here at that time ah for me you need to get straight four A's
geram seh but anyway ya
so ya lah and err I remember my teacher you know mister yaz telling me to like eh bila ya lah where are you going to
just drop one subject lah just drop one subject because they were they care so much about apa ni dia punya school punya standing ya they don't want they want to get us to get as many A's as possible lah so ya but then in the end I just decided to
this person tak boleh ajar ask me can you take over so okay then I take over then after I take over then say eh you are actually quite good ah uh
ya tapi tu tu show ada banyak problem seh
but the problem also not not not related to me lah pasal dia punya management lah they don't know how to sell the show they making lots of money even now you know a lot of people uh some of the
macam last time also I was pakai fikir apa tu alah nak buat like I always have this embarrassment tau kalau everytime kita buat show kan
how much to sell the tickets for then when you sell ticket alamak macam too much lah too expensive lah like I don't think people will want or like cannot afford cannot afford because we will we care about
the uh apa tu
bila kita calculate the budget
cannot it doesn't make sense we are losing in the end in the end we are not even err we are actually give it like say as if it's charity because we where we pay for other stuff we have to pay macam
you'll get loss lah rugi ah
okay noted tiga puluh minit oh wow
cannot decide ah kalau makanan makanan nak kena lit ah
dia teh tarik is always my actually I'm addicted to teh tarik it cannot kalau tak ada tak ada the teh tarik cannot
like even kalau
kat india okay lah not bad ah that time I was in bangalore
dorang kan ada dorang punya apa tu yang masala chai so and things like that so okay lah itu kelakar because
kecil kecil so I always like tak cukup I have to keep on buying and buying and buying later so in the end I came I said oh I saw they have this bigger cup for other drinks ah terus cakap can I have
boleh because dia dia tak ada the pricing tau for that thing so they just like anyhow give me a price so I said I don't mind then the next day I said even that not enough I brought my own water bottle I want your masala chai in my water bottle
chai just means tea that's why when we play scene when you when you say chai tea eh siapa tu
oh kita pause
kejap as we pick up some delivery
okay sambung balik
banyak distraction lah delivery lah
kau punya phone jangan mati eh dia okay ah
apa aku cakap oh ya okay lah so I think kalau makanan what favourite food I will eat
okay lah kalau drink teh tarik kalau makanan I don't know
I like nasi ambeng but I don't think I can eat nasi ambeng hari hari
buat selama-lamanya mm oh maybe okay lah kalau okay kalau nak fikirkan right I think
if I were to really strategise it something yang healthy
I don't know maybe protein shake ah not protein shake lah the one the one yang ada all the all the meals like
it's for survival dia macam okay you remember you watch matrix you know the yang dorang makan benda apa benda tu
then the guy was saying like um they were in the they were in a vessel uh but then after that they will makan some like some bubur or like porridge ke apa benda
dia cakap oh this is all this is everything that you need for your health that thing ah
um nasi ambeng maybe uh I don't know
for lunch nasi ambeng ah maybe something else
okay let's see what other prompts dorang kasi
promosi oh promosi beli satu percuma satu apakah yang paling teruk okay
ya lah maksudnya kalau macam
eh kau kan dulu kecil kecil ada belajar tu
hmm apa benda tak elok
dia ada batin batin ada dia kan ada kat masjid en-naeem kan
like that you bilang you bilang ibu ah
tengok ah
I also not so sure pasal to me dia macam nampak macam dancing
haven't melayu semua melayu silat
apa tak explain sikit
buka bunga apa open open flower open flower
so it's about really respect lah adat adat adat
okay then kalau martial arts what martial arts you want to learn
apa eh
the flying the flying arm bar I remember dia ajar macam mana nak buat flying arm bar
ni masih uni ah I think because
doing merepek-merepek stuff
because I did I do film school right so he study apa tu
then they were were trying to choreograph some the steps ah then I okay then aku more to learn lah then he show me a flying arm bar
ya ya ya so macam mana I got the video ah choreo but I remember it was uh
like ya ya so you you hook on to the tangan and then after that one of the kaki will
ya gitu sekali banyak kali ah that move actually they look a lot dekat apa tu what a lot of the fightings sequences lah that kind of hollywood
pasal okay so now eh do you about the guessing culture and asking culture
okay you know uh I was baca lah pasal okay can
so guess culture okay this question okay that I ask you ah kalau macam all your friend a text that you somebody didn't not your best friend ah think of uh somebody you jumpa every once a year or something like that
I'm using that person okay so let's say this person tanya okay ayisha uh can I uh macam stay at can I stay at your place for two weeks
eh oh okay gitu jer eh
kalau an asker
they know dorang tahu yang apa tu if you ask a question there's always a yes or no
two weeks macam
not as lama lah but they will say like how how could this person even
how dare they ask me like that question asal dia tak fikir pasal so there's a lot of like issues that come with it pasal
you either macam
who wants to come over and stay at your place for two weeks dia macam kurang ajar lah very rude how can you ask me you know and we're not even that close you know
got the hull invert um because they think like ada
but for so that's a point on guesser lah so I realised kita
there's a yes or no um people ask right ask you a question why you asking me that why ah apa motive kau eh what is it for faham tak
um macam for example lah
uh oh aku perasan apa yang you leave your
that that apa tu yang
if it is a western country I think boleh lah
but they don't understand apa tu yang
uh dorang tak faham
impian eh
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk apa ni
it's okay sekiranya anda harus menyerah segala-galanya bagi mengejar impian anda apakah yang akan anda risikokan malay>kau ni melayu dia
ah aku tahu melayu tak we don't speak like that what
wait kalau kita cakap bahasa melayu kan
pasal maybe
I okay this is what I learn lah melayu yang kita belajar dekat sekolah is not
is not the melayu
in conversation melayu ah
siapa seh cakap macam gitu
tapi no actually okay kita
I mean I I got ada kawan I do speak melayu tau I do speak malay with um
uh cuma with the bahasa the like the language yang bahasa melayu yang kita pakai
ah no no kita tak pakai bahasa baku pun kita pakai bahasa I don't know they call it bahasa pasar ke but they is like
macam mana like it's not
it's not the language yang kita belajar in school
then I also wonder kita belajar bahasa tu dari mana
uh aku rasa wishes ni mesti lebih realistik lah tak boleh yang merepek-merepek lah okay kalau realistik wishes aku rasa aku nak get rich lah one of it lah one of it maybe untuk get rich
the reason aku nak kaya pasal actually err aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan
then kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi fit ah aku nak jadi fit aku fit aku rasa macam aku pergi lari ah err dekat bedok reservoir ke macritchie ke I feel that uh my body feels good lah so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
superpower okay so err we are moving from realistic to not so realistic ah okay so superpower kalau boleh aku nak teleportation teleportation kalau tengok cerita X men eh dia sikit-sikit macam night crawler
err so kalau teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
um to a certain extent pasal lah tu err bila teleportation okay kononnya tak ada teleportation eh macam sekarang ni
kita dah kena expose more err how should I say it uh more unknowingly for example kita naik kita squeeze squeeze dekat
kalau kita squeeze squeeze naik atau naik taxi grab driver ke taxi driver ke ah kita expose in that uh area kita duduk kat dalam ke kat dalam kereta ke
untuk beberapa minit ini ah ada yang research cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang
jadi kalau ada measure measure contohnya macam uh sanitisation
let's say nak pergi giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
and I rest at work and exposed again ini tak boleh kalau kita dah teleportation teleportation kita skip all the buses ni semua ah all the transportation ini exposure
ah tak kan begitu
but then when this err banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan mm apa ni orang kata
kena pergi kursus ah kursus-kursus um macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer
menggunakan aplikasi word excel kenapa teknologi telah berubah
jadi mereka dah behind time so ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin okay kut
okay lah eh jap err kita err
saya teringat something ah yang pasal teleportation ah kita uh ni eh reverse sikit ah eh teleportation eh kononnya teleportation ni kan boleh kita boleh teleport
um bila kita umur sepuluh tahun
uh kira-kira ni macam so called macam time machine begitu ah uh macam advance yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya invention tapi tak tahu lah dah ada ke tidak ni
uh jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh teleport reverse time eh maybe kita teleport ten years old
nak cakap apa dengan awak punya uh diri tu okay kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia
err salah satu err experience yang aku pernah mengalami ah adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit lah ah tapi dia real ah
dia err it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving uh at tioman
bulu roma ternaik ah bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku
jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga so err saya tengah bawa macam biasa
tiba-tiba err saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan err di road tersebut lah di jalan raya tersebut
jadi err bila saya bawa
the person a a driver the driver that uh was err almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily err nothing happen tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja
tapi itu pun okay itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa
ah itu adalah uh experience saya lah yang near death experience or rather I would say a near miss ah how about you furqan
oho dah macam pantun berkerat
yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen uh yang tu semua lah uh dia orang kerja trip
lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut number of trip kalau dia orang
kan kurang lah gaji dia orang ah mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya err sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak
err lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin err anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa jer lah dia punya dia punya alasannya err

there see that guy macam that guy is the singapore social guy kan then she she was like
shu shu is my err my ex-colleague the one that is now working for berita harian as the
reporter actually the other day I I forgot lah that kak ain kan she just macam she just err wrote a new book right the java enigma
then after that she got the I err I was talking to her then like dia dapat the interview dengan berita harian right err
taking scraps ah from her colleagues so like quite I forgot about dia for a bit
oh ya anyway next time macam you kalau dengar like any like cool people or stories or people to interview ah just let me know ah then at least she has something to write about
okay so katakan dia is like twenty four twenty one years old twenty one years old
masih you will still consider
abang she's twenty one this year and you are twenty nine this year
katakan lah I I know someone who is twenty one years old this year and
anyway I was talking to kakak the other day she was asking whether she want to
belum but she she did tell me macam
err dia no lah dia ada make like ada make video lah like when she
um okay lah it's very big then dia ada macam err dua balconies two balconies
based on macam the video I saw it was macam dua dua balconies
I was talking to her then on the day yang err
kakak was err just mengumpat pasal dia punya
err mak mertua as per usual lah the usual err
topic of conversation between mummy kakak and the madrina
ya so then mummy was saying macam kakak is
the what's that anak mertua yang biadap I think that was the exact words err
that is a mm adjective to to describe kakak
but anyway err um remember kakak I was asking kakak when she
err celebrate hari raya in her current house
or celebrate hari raya in the next house because
eh no it should be may it should be may cause this year's hari raya was err dua puluh empat
I remember the hari raya was
dua puluh empat or dua puluh enam I think that was the
that was the official hari raya punya date
no lah as in just kakak was asking me lah macam mana cause
like kasi orang jalan jalan raya lah to her house
ya ya ya I I remember is the one yang abang yan dengan yang abang yan datang then he
yes yes is that is that one that one yang dia err minta kakak izin like err
kakak kata okay lah obviously but kakak was like cause what cause kakak couldn't say macam
no tak boleh datang kau tak boleh datang besok but like kakak was like okay
kenapa ni nak datang then I remember mum was saying macam dia tak ada barang tak ada benda lain tak buat apa
then macam why why then mum was telling the story of how he always goes to people's houses
ah ya ya I heard that he's doing it and cik anis is also doing it right was it
how old is abang yan again
suka hati eh abang just panggil orang gay eh
sangat deep
macam best sangat ke
bagus sangat ke ah ugh it doesn't happen in
there's macam everybody is more free and liberal in
for right okay I know that kalau you nak masuk kalau you nak dapatkan the hostel room right
yang the korean punya show yang dia orang taruk the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
kejar them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
like other celebrities have to chase them and cari I believe they have to pull the name tag off lah
she like it was very popular so I remember me and kakak we were saying that
but last time dia punya zaman also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball dengan football T-shirt
last time we used to have this err music teacher kat bowen ah his name was err mister jamal
like professional macam
dia punya club room he
either he's kekek like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers punya basketball punya like
ya so macam the husband must be really making serious money ah
macam tak masuk akal lah like
and it's not that there's anything wrong with kerja kerja lah but
you're so macam
supply chain abang a job that is quite a big need in singapore
exactly so macam tak masuk akal lah macam
those macam how they rank the
hundred shares bonds ah you have to like buy by the thousands ah if I'm not mistaken so macam you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
but ya lah it just doesn't makes sense to me that dah dah dah belajar susah-susah then macam
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that mamat the his boyfriend
he was quite against macam he liked to look down on a lot of this macam people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this macam
the halal version of jack's restaurant lah there was one at
it's the steak one I remember the there's a halal one made by this chef then he had a
I believe it is or it's just err something like jack's but it's halal
then the mother is back there then he is here lah then the father remarried then I think like the father macam
dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit lah like the father
like macam it doesn't make sense lah and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from wei xiang wei xiang told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
lemon yogurt you tak you tak ingat eh
you don't macam
macam bodoh lah macam don't don't jangan lah pakai your own freaking like
so so macam I was telling like him ah that
they they don't want to macam speak out against like gay people because like
like people don't want to macam oh actually she's a liar and all these ya
a lot lah I tell you right all these macam people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like dee kosh is quite stupid lah in my mind macam
you're famous kau famous macam like people know people people know your face then
kau buat macam gini macam you want to proposition right don't use your own account lah
pakai macam pakai fake account lah gini pakai your own account macam you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for macam like someone is
because macam
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to macam
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough macam
so same for dee kosh ah macam just because you you
doesn't like make it right lah you should own self macam
first of all right there is no budak zaman sekarang you and me right are difference by five years only
okay first of all right it's not budak-budak zaman sekarang there are people your age right
what rothschild what those other like err rockefeller and those macam
lauder the the family that still owns the that owns the Estee Lauder punya line the lauder family
all your shakes macam
so ya so macam
I'm a foodie so macam
you know what this reminds me okay no no no ingat tak mummy kan kata macam she said that
the I think wak nia right was just posting so much about her life on the like
WhatsApp group chat so mummy was saying macam sia annoying lah macam um kenapa nak buat macam gini
mm people yang yang nak attention lah yang yang yang gila gila attention so much ah that's what mum was saying macam
people yang like you know macam
huh they gila kan lelaki no macam they crazy for attention lah like they they
I I would be quite interested in like what is macam joe rogan's punya like
that he has fights to macam to announce ah like
what does he do like what is there macam preps that he have to do does he actually have to like research on
oh okay okay okay aku pernah dulu aku pernah buat apa ni mystery shopper that was many years back lah then after that uh the I only did once
because uh lepas tu like there's no job and nobody call me lah I did the ah aku pernah buat yang apa yang shopping tu eh
I did the one for uh one of the retailers in singapore lah but I have to go it's a it's a one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet tau lepas tu kan
one of the important one is the customer service ah because they are rating customer service punya survey
so you actually depends ah macam when you go for this job they will advise you first like what are the things err they are looking out for
and then err ya but for me is I just concentrate one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet lah
tapi uh after that they never call me oh for very long then after that just gone like that
but I got a friend who was doing something similar tapi dia punya product is
then uh she's given one product so it actually varies macam kau buat uh mystery shopping right
it's not just like shopping items sometimes it can even be like err basic necessity macam for your home
but uh my friend one is quite interesting dia pergi dia buat pasal uh food product ah I think they give her one product
can't remember what product I think macam like uh macam maggi then with a a particular brand specific brand
lepas tu nanti uh dia kena pergi uh two or three no three or four different err supermarket
so it depends ah macam mana kau punya what when you get the job you can actually find out what it's very interesting for a and it's very good pay
tak lah sia upfront
so it's your own free time bila kau nak pergi besok ke bila kau nak bila-bila once you are done before that the deadline that they give you
ya it's quite fast cuma uh they will give you a deadline lah by this date kau kena submit back come back to the office and submit ah
lama seh but I think that time was not hundred ah less than that
mm assignment tapi the assignment uh dia kasih macam uh tiga
the one the ya then the questions is all similar lah cuma three different outlet kau kena pergi then macam outlet A outlet B outlet C lepas tu the questions are the same ah
so customer service then the setting of the shop the display all that macam berselerak ke ataupun very neat always very neat
uh eh this date this or this week right got this date this time uh apa ni surveyor coming
so it's like uh consistency lah cuma the
tapi like the working hours how
cuma it's like quite far lah I mean uh I think I feel like it's quite far tapi three times a week okay what ah
ya lah but I heard that the pay is quite good you know uh apa ni I think it's fifteen dollars per hour
depends on the places that you are assigned to I think like macam dormitories eh the they can even pay up to macam I think twenty five dollars
that's why I was telling my friend uh and my friend was saying lah macam gini like uh she just have to work three four hours part time she already earn like almost hundred dollars you know
tapi uh do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
ya lah rumah dia berapa bilik seh
mm it's so far it's still okay lah we don't have any pay cut tapi macam
macam uh like how long can we tahan like that right like are you sure there's no retrenchment like are you sure you are not going to retrench people or like we are very very skeptical lah
so like uh and then plus being in the fintech kan macam don't know whether is good or is not good because like the situation now it's like so so unpredictable
then uh like other products macam very slow moving so we don't know how long we can sustain
ya lah I mean rumours have been going around lah it's better to look for something else but again in this situation macam mana nak cari seh
abeh kalau macam right now like right now I'm still okay lah I still have a job what but then
so I was like eh when I look at linkedin I was like eh ada eh orang masih nak masih nak cari ni ah
dia jaga macam uh one of the creative uh asia pacific punya director eh APAC director
then the boss always travel overseas pergi overseas punya office kan
lepas tu uh her pay is like close to ten K you know eight or nine thousand you know
basically aku tengok macam
I was like oh my gosh macam some people are just so lucky
lepas tu macam new joiner new secretary join kan lepas tu dia tak nak uh macam she she will be the mentor lah because she senior what
and then uh selalu tak nak ajar lepas tu macam tolak balak jer lah like like just ask people to do ah ask people to do the powerpoint
uh ask people to change the apa send out the video but her pay is so damn good okay sekali it in the end bila dia punya boss tu dah tua ah
sekali just before I left uh boss dia kena macam apa macam apa tu
bukan retrench apa tu macam uh dah dah tua kan jadi uh kena
so uh they we speculated ah dia dia kata golden handshake so the boss leave right
kan aku dah macam eh kayanya dia ni lepas tu dia tak ada anak
for her europe trip lah this trip lah that trip lah I was like lepas tu the worst part is kerja lepak gila
but who the she was the one who supposed to do the powerpoint you know in the end she ask the other people yang macam very uh pandai buat powerpoint kan
ah then buat lepas tu dia dia just submit to the boss that's all her job like that I also can do and I can still earn eight nine K you know
gila kan
no lah but she was she was okay lah it's just that she's an okay friend but then it's just that working wise macam suka ask people to do buat ni buat tu eh
then she will be like uh sorry I have a a lunch appointment sorry I have this appointment that appointment lepas tu kalau tidak dia cakap okay dia tolong kan
sekali apparently that day she's on leave and she never tell you know macam bastard kan then then I will be like oh my god gosh like
eh when you ask me to ask you to to help you I help you seh then I was like okay lah then just telan jer lah because we are all junior level what she's the senior one what
macam merepek kan like so funny
and then she never tell him ke
yes yang dulu tu uh every time want to travel on only
kecoh seh but actually because I want to collect the points ah
so funny but they are allowed to travel on lah but then macam ah cannot the expensive uh like whatever flight eh kau tahu dari like expensive flights and all that right
ya lah macam yang boleh cancel boleh change semua kan
ya lah tu pasal kadang-kadang ah like what like especially the boss that likes to change every time will change lah or confirm will change his flight one right
aku nak book macam ah so scary then I will always wait until like really last minute eh kadang-kadang macam cannot so last minute what
ah macam ah the first name and last name terbalik apa and then got one or like I think two alphabet lah typo error
salah salah salah the name uh of the passenger becomes my name
the traveller's name to my name because I cannot use that uh apa macam
lagi pergi hong kong siak tu kalau pergi indonesia ke pergi mana mana like okay lah got potential to keep uh at most I pay back the company what
sekali tu that one is like like uh to hong kong and then is like completely different name ah so I called them up and asked to change right
and then uh apa ni they say cannot then I said
is I explained the whole situation lah I said I when I fill up I already fill up the correct name the correct passport the date of birth passport number semua
then cuma the last part the contact person the contact person when I fill up my uh I fill up my name
then uh there's one part that they they auto macam auto fill eh
sekali I go and pay everything then I realise and then after ah but they don't they didn't they didn't bother to listen to my explanation lah
tak baik seh
aku bilang aku punya tu lah yang senior tu makcik tu makcik makcik kaypoh tu
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku uh it's okay lah everybody make mistake don't worry tapi dia baik cuma macam dia kaypoh eh
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku just tell the uh pula tu aku kena bilang
dia cakap just tell the he's a very nice person uh I will back you up anyway you just started
cakap okay lah selamat ah first time kan so aku cakap abeh tapi aku offer lah if you want I can pay half of the flight ticket ah muka sedih ah
tapi tu baik gila sia dia cakap uh nevermind it's okay uh just make sure next time you don't repeat the same mistake ni semua ah blah blah blah that one I was less than three months old in the company you know like I see how much was the ticket
ya lah tapi macam irritating tak boleh kasih chance seh
irritating lepas tu kan lagi sekali uh is what ah
then after dah kecoh gila sekali got one guy and one guy right he's supposed to travel he is from vietnam to singapore he supposed to travel uh with
lepas tu the three of them reached the airport
sekali two of them went in<malay>dah masuk sekali tu yang the this the the last guy right was they she want to check in ah then the dengan bag dia semua tau
kesian dia dah lah check out daripada hotel lepas tu dia pergi kat airport abeh airport cakap ah sir your flight is tomorrow not tonight
lepas tu it's tomorrow night ah not tonight sekali dia kata no cannot be because we ah my my uh my colleague

lepas tu dia dia tak check lepas tu dia dia check dia kata uh oh
it's tomorrow's date dia kata ya so see your flight is tomorrow's date tomorrow's timing but it's the same time as that day lah yang dia nak kena depart kan
sekali terus dia call aku kau dekat aiport dia cakap hi hidayah
did you know that you book my flight for uh apa
aku dah oh my god then aku tak bawa balik computer
I was like oh shit I was like mula-mula aku ketawa tau aku cakap huh aku macam ketawa ah
sekali dia kata no it's not funny when you are at the airport and two of your colleagues are going to board the plane and you are stuck here with no hotel room to go to
aku dah macam eh sia ah die die sia mana aku nak carikan dia ni hotel and he is very specific luckily bukan boss ah dia macam manager level there
aku dah selamat sia kalau boss aku mampus
then I was like ah oh okay terus aku macam okay okay let me check for you like the next available flight ah dia kata err
I don't want to fly macam certain timing apa dia sekarang aku nak kena book under the new flight apa dia mati-mati nak leave uh that night ataupun the next day morning eh
because he got meeting or whatsoever lah so he need to leave like there as soon as possible kecoh sia
ya then I was like ah okay okay let's divide and conquer you find hotel I go and find flight then he was like okay okay okay aku
tu lah masalahnya because they always keep on changing tau and then aku rasa uh yang yang lain tu aku dah book siang-siang tapi si lelaki ni
dia kasih dia bilang aku last minute dia nak flight ni nak flight tu the these are the flights he want this is ni ah
kira dia bilang aku last minute aku book kan dia separately last minute ah aku bukan book kan dia orang tiga-tiga at the same time
lepas tu aku tengok eh aku dah kecoh sia cari hotel
lepas tu aku cari flight ah lepas tu lepas tu dia call aku dia cakap did you manage to get the flight aku cakap uh not yet
abeh aku kasih dia options kan lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku ya I also can't get a hotel
uh it's too last minute and no hotels around here ah ya it's all fully book aku dah macam alamak
in the end we got lah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia like uh aku tak boleh dapat flight yang kau betul-betul nak at this exact timing yang kau nak depart this is the only best option eh
habis tu dia cakap uh apa apa apa lepas tu dia kata ah okay then uh he he we sorted out the flights ah
hotel pula then uh last minute he say he just went back to the hotel that he just check out kesian kau I feel so bad I was like
apa dia dia kata uh I just took I'm going to take a taxi now to go back to the hotel and see they have one last room
abeh aku cakap ah okay okay okay uh you take the cab and then I know lah the journey about thirty minutes eh
lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia you go and take the cab now I will call the hotel
lepas tu pergi ah
lepas tu dah dah finish after the whole episode right dia dah balik hotel dia dah dapat tau the last room and I think it's the smallest room he's and he's very particular about hotel room also
so dia cari dah lah last minute tak ada hotel tapi nak cari hotel yang according to his category
aku dah macam ambil jer lah hotel apa yang ada it's just for one more night the next day afternoon that time he's flying off already what
lepas tu dia cakap uh yang dia patah balik hotel tu sekali kita berbual-berbual uh abeh aku cakap dengan hotel tu ah boleh ah macam any room can ah because
it's just for one night ah lagipun dia selalu regular kat hotel kau
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay and then in the end they found one small studio room for him ah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
dia kata no it's okay lepas tu uh sabo sia lepas tu dia dapat dia tak dapat flight yang pagi kan pasal the next day petang dia ada meeting tau
lepas tu pagi dia tak dapat flight yang dia nak kena balik kan aku dapatkan dia petang ke malam I think
lepas tu uh bila dia dia bilang dengan boss aku kira he's under my boss what dia bilang dengan boss aku uh
lepas tu aku cakap eh sabo sia dia ni tapi boss aku tak marah boss aku ketawa jer dia cakap are you just trying to skive and not come for the meeting
dia cakap no she book me the wrong flight aku dah macam oh crazy
kan lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia lah eh then you also should check you know aku tapi aku macam okay lah let's not be let's not fight over this aku cakap dengan dia we are both at fault I booked wrongly and you didn't check
mampus kan actually initially he was like that tapi aku cakap dengan dia there's really no other flights
uh budget flight pun tak ada unless you want to reel up and go via mana entah aku cakap dengan dia macam a very long route eh in the end you reach singapore also like the same
and lepas tu macam but after that he was like okay lah tapi he took that opportunity to shoot me back ah in front of my boss dia cakap ah ya she book me on the wrong date
flight back aku dah macam tapi yang ni pun sepatutnya aku kena declare dengan finance the ya the right
aku cakap eh uh eh this is what happen dia kata in case if uh anybody question then you can just look for me ah but if nobody question just let it go
buy new ticket ah lepas tu pun dah cock-up lagi then the the makcik kaypoh the senior told me like it's okay you just have to declare again aku cakap
declare lagi hari tu dah declare cakap sorry then declare lagi mampus
tu ah
lepas tu aku cakap ah takpe lepas tu but then the finance I think the finance explained to the lah
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay lah dah
uh aku rasa something more expensive tu pasal in the end he earn what right because he get to fly on the more expensive flight and don't have to go for meeting
uh entah
one way ticket totally different airline kiranya vietnam tu forfeit ah pasal dia tak nak travel on that timing yang kat vietnam yang aku dah book tu the next day punya kan
aku cakap pergi jer lah balik jer lah besoknya dah terang-terang dah ada vietnam flight tu
vietnam apa ho chi minh
tak tapi hari tu semua dah fully booked tak ada tak ada flight
budget airline yang kita check lepas tu ada like go uh transit via whatever very far away right
irritating kan with the transit punya tu
ya lah that's why I was like like lepas tu dia pula macam he's very particular hotel leh
then flight okay dia macam apa-apa macam economy apa-apa lah dia cuma but tapi hotel must be really
tu aku cakap mampus sia that day terus sekarang aku cakap uh we let's we both learned a lesson every time I send you you check okay
dia kata but uh it's not funny aku kata it's not funny when your
kan kelakar kan tapi lepas tu bila dia balik singapore I think the next he say hey let me uh hidayah let me buy you coffee we should go for a good coffee
dia cakap ya let's just go to the one across the road no need to get so expensive
lepas tu dia macam aku cakap dengan dia so next time moving forward aku book kau please check because aku cakap dengan dia at that point of time kau tahu tak date yang aku book tu bila
aku book on friday I think five plus in the evening eh nak dekat pukul enam tau
last minute everybody like confirm confirm confirm nak ni nak tu lepas tu kita aku duduk kat office tu dengan kawan aku kat depan ni
we went through like so many booking and then takut macam duplicate booking kan macam aku dah book the book kan
lepas tu some of the people right in the kira total about eleven twelve people all travelling at one time
but all like different departure date ah different timing different flight terus aku split dengan kawan aku ni aku cakap okay kau buat dia ni punya flight aku buat dia punya flight okay
lepas tu macam overlap lepas tu uh bilik pula kau buat ah okay kau buat this hotel room aku buat ni ni ni punya okay
lepas tu macam it's so messy I was like oh my gosh
takkan aku nak buat on weekend seh so I have to do it over what I was like

lepas tu uh those who is travelling on saturday there is some from my list that is also travelling on saturday so aku pass kat dia
lepas tu dia anyway ya lah
lepas tu ah it's it's like that lah so it becomes like I don't just take care of my team you know macam my team got ten people right she got two for example right
then I got like maybe three people that's also travelling on the same date as her one of the people that she's in her team so macam kita passing passing eh
lepas tu hotel pula lagi satu kan kita kena book direct we don't have travel agent what
ah aku punya team luckily that guy is like like like like very good I mean he's okay with me lah
he's irritatingly macam uh macam action he's from india
tapi actually he's he's a very straightforward person and he he mean no harm lah it's just business nothing personal eh
lepas tu yang si hotel lagi satu hal
kita book direct kita takde ni kan travel agent kita book direct kan lepas tu kita pergi lah booking dot com hotels dot com apa apa yang murah-murah tu kan
lepas tu hotel the the same hotel dah full

terus aku macam aku dah beli empat ratus lebih baru kau nak cakap kau diam-diam dah lah ambil jer visa ni
mampus eh
tapi dia ni very soft spoken very soft spoken macam very lemah lembut gitu
lepas like and then another day is like uh kita tu hari buat video farewell kan
lepas tu kita go around macam uh like everybody just have to wave to the camera ah
lepas tu kawan aku tengah pegang camera tengah jalan around the office kan sekali yang si boss yang aquarius ni
kau tahu dia bukan wave tau dia tunjuk middle finger lah sia
terus kita semua macam terperanjat because he really look like a nerdy good boy macam
you ask him to do anything dia akan buat punya ah macam very like listen like very obedient small boy like that ah
sekali kawan aku tengah jalan take the camera shot in the office kan sekali pergi kat tempat dia he's supposed to wave
suddenly he uh he pull out the middle finger then we were like oh my god did what happen to the good boy like kena sampuk apa sia dia ni
tu dia cakap dia kata cut cut cut retake retake

sekali when he show the middle finger I was like oh my gosh all men are the same
ah dia kira aku punya boss ah dia dia
uh marketing side chief marketing officer kelakar
but I was like muka baik macam budak-budak baik sekali padahal sama juga
tak lah singapore ah
sama lah I also
because bila food
but nugget pun chicken what
if it's one lauk for the rest of my life
apa sambal goreng pengantin with ketupat or with nasi
or sambal goreng pengantin with bergedil and nasi
and sis tak akan get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent makanan yang I crave for is
sambal goreng pengantin lah
like ya because to me like sambal goreng pengantin is
sebab you will have everything there
you got paru
ada veggie ah ada sambal kacang panjang
ada chicken
hati ayam pedal eh hati ayam ke pedal eh
limpa eh
bukan eh hati ayam kan
ah so sambal goreng pengantin is like everything that I like to eat is what macam satu dish you makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap seh
but it's considered one what tak eh
oo tak consider eh
why why macam why like that
what tapi itu lah okay lah tak apa lah sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi sis
pulut begitu jer
pulut tak ada rasa sis
pulut lah but you cannot put other lauk
ah tahu lah pulut
because pulut is one dish
the pulut is not a makanan it's not considered lah
because food is life tengok lah badan kita sis
bodoh bodoh
habis sis nak makan apa make up your mind
oo if kita boleh
choose like macam
a dish tak
ada sugar cane
but dia tak ada dia tak ada limited hours you boleh duduk dekat dalam kan
macam if you go yang kita pergi dekat yishun tu yang tu kan if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but yang dia dinner dia up to four hours around three and a half hours lah macam tu
maybe because dia macam on the wheel sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like kenapa Seoul Garden tak boleh extend dia punya duduk dekat dalam
itu lah but if like pun ramai orang masuk apa
mana Seoul Garden Seoul Garden kita duduk sebelum dua jam seh
or exactly two hours then kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu full
so maybe next time we can try lah duduk dekat dalam
for like two hours plus and tengok kena halau ke tak
we should we should apa what's the word ah bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
yang is because dia tak ada they should buat air dalam jug taruk dekat situ
macam Seoul Garden so it's easy pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang the person hantar air
lambat seh
ah lepas tu nanti orang tu get irritated
macam that time pasal naan tu
the person yang get irritated
mm lepas tu dia
macam food lah unlimited food
okay let's say let's say tak ada COVID
so if sis only have to keluarkan duit makan sis have no problem with that
so yang lain so kita bayar makan jer lah like okay lah let's say makan pun alah depends ah
feeling orang kaya because it's fully paid for
sis macam nak makan korean food jom kita fly pergi korea
habis oyster kat mana yang sedap eh was it
the only the the two places that I managed to pergi was
dengan Seoul Garden
and Seoul Garden is totally macam
mm ha macam gitu
woo sis main air satu hari
kalau both of us ah dekat situ ah
kan macam gitu lah
but bora bora is more cantik
but they say yang if they want yang siapa eh they share dia punya travel experiences to see the ah si aifiqah ke mana siapa entah dia kena tidur dekat luar seh then macam imagine it's freezing
oh ya sis terlupa pasal itu ya
oh sis pun nak pergi turkey especially yang dekat hot air balloon punya tempat tu apa cappadocia wah
err dia orang boleh naik all the time you know it's not available all the time it's like terlalu windy cannot then kalau hujan cannot
macam siapa eh that time pergi dia pergi then tak straight away dapat then they have to wait like a few days after that
but they say dekat turkey it's haunted
ya turkey punya sihir eh turkey punya black magic is very very scary
bulan puasa jin is outside only syaitan is locked
so it's like that sis the logic because adik sis pun bulan puasa kena sampuk ya
ya turkish turkish people is very scary dia orang kalau buat buat sampai mati dia orang tak fikir tau dosa dosa pahala dia orang go straight punya dia orang berani mati punya orang tau
ya and dia orang punya macam and
dia orang macam I think dia punya polis eh when it comes to orang mati pasal sihir I think it's a norm thing like I think unusual death is macam benda biasa untuk dia orang
if you watch dabbe sis watch sampai terngiang-ngiang okay
like they can even like sanggup buat mak dia sendiri
yang the latest one eh ke apa
a'ah habis perempuan tu she's aware that
husband ada affair
lepas tu dia buat macam semua kena tau if you watch eh dia macam pretend that dia tak tahu apa-apa pasal dia yang buat
I don't know it's no dia buat mak dia
mmhmm ada nanti macam dia ada macam revenge macam
apa macam tadi you say about mak apa issue ah
like family issues I don't know lah lepas tu buat sampai adik dia gila and something like that lah
the anak buat lah anak dia buat mak dia dengan adik dia
kakak dia yang jahat lepas tu kakak dia nak revenge cuba you watch again
no kakak dia pergi pergi dekat ilmu sihir tu then when the person want to help her the orang yang ilmu sihir tu orang orang yang ilmu sihir tu terus mati he met the ilmu sihir tu tau
yang tukang ubat tu yang si bomoh tu tau
don't want sis tak nak being haunted again it took me a lot of time to still forget about it you know
a'ah a'ah lepas tu kan dia buat macam husband dia ke perempuan tu bunuh kan
the girl the girl yang doctor tu jahat the girl is a doctor what
so bila sis tengok cerita tu sis macam wow like so many things then bila orang tu figure out everything kan
turn turns out macam orang tu pun mati
ke orang tu
ya the tukang ubat tu pergi jumpa yang sihir konon very popular tau
the after dia ada jumpa
like macam perempuan tu jahat
dia cakap kan perempuan tu cakap aku tak suka perempuan ni aku tak suka perempuan ni
so the girl can see tapi lelaki tu macam kau merepek ah macam itu
err macam to to the guy macam he is in between believing macam dia dia as
dia percaya in the unseen as part of faith
cannot mix with science what so he's trying to do both tau to be like nak try to make a logic of that
but ya lah pasal logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but benda unseen ni
we cannot macam
and it's not of our faith to like rukun iman we have to believe in the unseen sebab tu
I don't know lah sis ingat nak pergi
yang macam sis dengar tadi yang cakap dekat situ is cheap yang ada buffet tu halalan toyyiban
ya ke I thought like no lah they showed example if it's eighty dollars eh let's say the amount is seventy five dollars you still it's better you pay seventy dollar then five dollar you pay cash ah dia begitu but that dia tak cakap kena breakdown in how many parts what dia cuma cakap cannot stack
cannot stack that is not macam tak boleh is not refundable
dia cuma cakap begitu jer apa so I think I can pay one ticket ah
it that time dia punya normal ticket is sixty plus sixty eight then express you tambah ten dollars jer seh
ten ke fifteen dollar so it's around eighty plus lah
but cat cat tak boleh bawa masuk dalam
ah dia ada nya turkey
but that time sis makan tempat dia punya yang dekat shrek punya tempat eh
ya sis nak try then dekat mana eh is makanan india
because sis pergi dua kali the first one is
like makan and everything sponsored
bedek seh
sis tak dapat pergi pun
one is at night time because masa tu is like a charity event
so sis dapat masuk malam it's from seven to eleven only
but tak ramai orang ah and the queue is not a lot so sis tak payah beratur panjang but imagine
but imagine pergi jurassic park punya tempat malam-malam sis for a minute there sis panic
yang dia punya ride yang air tu
habis kan dia naik kan
sis dah panic sis nya claustrophobic coming
yang dia duduk yang macam yang dekat roundabout circle kan begitu nanti dia warning then naik
dia macam begitu dah ternaik kan naik tinggi lepas tu dah dekat atas terus shoot begitu
ya I had fun too basah
that time yang yang kita nak try mummy sekali mak dia sampai pujuk the mother pujuk me untuk naik tapi mak tak takut kalau mak penakut ni mak rasa tak takut means it's not scary at all
mmhmm mak dia don't like to take ah roller coaster mak dia scared of roller coaster
a'ah mummy is always long queue then I asked the guy you know yang dekat situ is mummy ride scary
no lah to me if you ask me roller coaster tu lagi scary
then macam dekat sini cuma gelap sahaja lah begitu
but no but the tepi got the drying station what
eh halloween horror nights let's say if you pergi for the halloween horror night right so that means all the rides is still ada lah
then hantu-hantu tu
sis jerit tak
terkejut a'ah lah
sama lah without the express ticket lah
but I think halloween horror nights more people daripada biasa because people nak pergi haunted houses dia
sis nak pergi yang that time punya halloween horror nights yang ada kak pon tu
sebab dia orang cakap bila dia orang buat and the the no no he just gave birth
he wanted to ajak me then sis was thinking then sis macam should I go sebab I heard cerita that masa dia orang make the kak pon punya tempat they malam tengah malam bila nak dia orang nak tutup I think dia kena kacau what
kak pon hmm
oh dekat situ then
maybe she don't want to tell people because nanti orang tak nak datang
ya nothing will scare the shit out of me unless benda tu
a'ah and benda melayu because sis macam melayu
serious dia orang sabah also believe in benda-benda voodoo
oh orang asli is scary also you know
oh that time kan ada yang macam ah there's this exhibition right that macam museum kan exhibition dia buat yang macam you asked me nak pergi ke tak like benda-benda black magic
I don't know lah dia ada macam keris the keris tinggi lepas tu ah dia tangkap the toyol the toyol in the jar and everything ada kak pon paku kak pon
it was it was two years ago lah but where is I think it's at pasir ris the the apa
ya ya I remember it's there because ah I remember hafiz telling me that you want to go like it seems fun lah then I said like macam but it's scary sebab si
jian cheng pergi so I'm not wrong lah
macam dekat situ then ah dia punya bulu roma like betul-betul diri
because the keris is not a normal keris sebab keris tu is
dah fuse black magic
kan tiba
was it dia tengah driving ke apa no eh no no no no that was in aerostar bay eh
ha engkau tak kelakar eh brother
it's not funny sia you not funny lu lu cari pasal sama wa brother
in islam we believe right kalau kita mati our roh does not exist co-exist in this alam already so that means we are in another dimension tau so our dimension only macam co-exist time we sleep betul tak so like for example if kita mati kita nampak orang-orang people then if
is it the roh of the people or is it ghost or like jin in a form of people
jin or syaitan lah but is it
a really roh atau jin in a form of
ah manusia
apa sia
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn rumah tu semua is actually not because of to have rumah for them and others right
it's actually to show that ah bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita or something like that
what if like life is like that ah then the miskin like got tak ada chance seh
you just imagine eh kalau kita macam the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe orang dekat sana
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you macam too depressed and you tak boleh happy tu cakap you it's like a lot story in the news that people bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision atau
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin apa
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin lah so that's why I say macam
so even if kita kita tak ada duit pun it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do lah kita bunuh diri kita sendiri
kau bunuh people
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money what you you ah yo hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar gets into the head dia stress sangat then macam
socked in the head then terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa is it happens
but we don't know what like macam some people depression macam too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve dia punya debts then they kill
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim eh let's say lah even if you have a chance syurga then if you still have to stay in neraka like you never know how long you have to stay in neraka
and one other story is like macam like sometimes it it gets to me yang macam ah
they say the first thing that will be questioned in alam kubur or in the hereafter is solat like if
if kau the first question like solat kau tak pass yang benda lain semua tak matter already
then it gets to me lah then macam then some people say like some mazhab say ya you no need to pay balik yang
the solat that you missed ah solat just solat taubat then you just try not to do it again
but some people some mazhab say you have to pay back after every solat like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until kita mampus then I asked I asked some people lah let's say kan macam how are we going to know how many solat that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay lah let's say kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis that at times kita solat juga
repay oh maybe if tak
I I wanted to I wanted to ask lah if let's say kita because we are busy in this world kan kita kejar kejar kejar kejar sometimes we don't have time to qada kan so let's say in a sense that kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh
like let's say like aku because of the missed prayer kan
then sis taubat so maybe macam sis susah nak tidur malam then the only time that I can wake up is pukul tiga pagi onwards ah
so maybe that's the time that like macam can be it macam not ganti lah like can it help or not
kan sis macam takut tau let's say macam I want to be prepared macam sis want best of both world I want macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat so let's say macam kita dekat dunia macam ini jer macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam we are already bad dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini
ya just like the story yang yang the orang yang bunuh yang the ninety nine killer or something like that or yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu then dia repent
dia repent dia mati dia masuk syurga because the person say no he didn't belum he haven't tau taubat because allah take his niat as orang tu cakap oh engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang first the first pergi dekat first ustaz ni he went there lepas tu ustaz tu say oh kau tak akan diampunkan lah kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua something like that lah so he out of geram he killed the ustaz
dia kill the ustaz you know
ah then he went to this another ustaz then the ustaz was saying oh ah kalau kau nak berubah if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place macam tempat yang lebih baik lah so he ah kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama something like that
no this is another ustaz so he dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place dia meninggal mati so bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga
ya because niat dia because dia belum taubat lagi tau he tak tahu apa-apa because he just on his way to nak taubat to get out of the place then he already get to syurga so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the niat that matters lah
tapi dah maki lah tu
ya lah tapi maki jer lah
so if you want to maki just maki jer lah kan
moral of the story is all based on out niat what so if like allah decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins dengan kita punya doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of jannah
tapi tak minus
dah ada stated there
I hope for that ustaz also yesterday that macam he's saying lah macam we should educate our child
that be modest penting is part of islam and all but kita pun kena ajar anak kita that you know doesn't mean that dia tak pakai tudung she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child macam what islam is all about since young and it starts from asar dia cakap
ya lah macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap oh dia tak modest dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik it's not a good thing ah to me personally lah because pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan is all masing-masing
I think just now ah flying all my tudung then macam apa ni ten
lam soon singapore ke tadi
kurang ajar eh what
kita dah pernah kena judge lah that's why we don't we know how it is kalau people judge us
like sis pernah kena judge masa sis kerja dekat ah my previous workplace yang kat tai seng tu kan
ah I I apa after I started pakai balik tudung right
slowly lah I think after that dah dua tahun ah but it's still slow still new lah then masa tu ah I was judged by one of the co-workers lah dia macam
aku tak suka ah perempuan pakai tudung then I asked why lah then dia macam oh semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak jer baik but behind semua hisap rokok lah ambil laki orang lah I macam who are you to judge like macam just because satu orang buat kau nak judge aku macam itu
ya lah but it's not perempuan pakai tudung jer buat apa yang tak pakai tudung also buat what
so why are you judging just because we wear tudung wear tudung doesn't mean yang kita ni malaikat what
and then sis macam tak puas hati lah kena judge macam itu
step baik
kurang ajar sia
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are semua pun macam tak betul how
at first sis was like sis dah jadi defensive lah because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends semua tak nak friend with me
because macam alim begitu kan she don't wan't to friend with me sebab she say ah kau dah pakai tudung
then buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat
then I say to her lah tak semestinya that I wear tudung aku baik seh
I wear tudung is because I wanted
change for agama lah
like sis want to change like sampai bila nak jadi macam itu maybe if I wear tudung it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to macam jaga diri in public
like sometimes kita dekat public kita
you know like macam dulu I never wear tudung then sis pakai baju low cut and nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk tau
our intention is not macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun but nampak
so macam to me it elak fitnah
a'ah especially especially if you wear niqab
when you wear niqab right dia punya niat is to stay away from guys right to macam
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern nya days if you wear niqab instead you attract more guys
you kau tak normal apa like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
hmm a lot of guys are macam itu sekarang
masa yang si nurul tu kan then yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin kan dia pakai niqab kan
not the ex one lah the girl that she's getting to know lah yang dah kahwin
when she wear niqab dia nampak cantik lah like you will imagine her to be a cantik girl so many girls are adding her tau
memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab she is very she is wearing niqab what so she delete all her pictures yang tak ada niqab
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear niqab
but sis don't want to be macam tu but sometimes
ada apa you know in malaysia ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab
dia pakai niqab and then she's very young then macam nampak mata jer kan then she berbual very lembut very lemah lembut
ah then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like macam wah lemah lembut then muka kau cantik
then I when I was having this conversation with hafiz I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear niqab lah because the purpose of wearing niqab is to grown away daripada attention what
so if like aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku then lepas tu aku berbual begitu
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know kita dekat public eh bodoh lah like that
because sometimes when we wear tudung also our cara cakap also still the same what
err pakai pakai niqab
you nak jaga macam mana nak makan then macam like sometimes when we talk to guys like
tak tak open masuk kat masuk kat bawah lah tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah
then macam I say macam I hear perempuan pakai niqab I hear dia orang macam giggle macam gedik like I don't like
maybe because I have unresolved issue with perempuan pakai niqab
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue macam
like neelofa ah macam neelofa
so macam so
people lagi macam have a better understanding of islam
so if kau react wrongly people macam oh orang islam macam ini lah
then I've asked myself if I were to wear niqab then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes ah like macam to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like macam if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing hijab I am not wearing properly
so sis jawab apa
people will judge us name like makcik-makcik
mmhmm maybe we should maybe we should start doing that lah macam neelofa you know like
she change the misconception that macam oh pakai
purdah mesti boring but if she change ah dia tak macam sparkling macam
tak macam there's bling sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam okay lah
so if you that's why they say when you pakai benda ni you are sacrificing the things that women like most
cantik lah
then remember mak saying you know like when you want to wear niqab when you want to wear purdah
because you are attracting people like if kau dah buat macam gitu that is
I may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here jadi kalau you like told off what if sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup then like kita dah jauh perjalanan kan telah tutup so like
I would like to explore I wanna have a lot of nature in it so I ada orang suka bunuh very curious about bunuh ah and then I also like to tengok pokok
sometimes I wish singapore has like four seasons so I can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window eh hari ini ada pokok this colour eh hari ini ada salji eh hari ini ada and then like tapi kadang-kadang I fikir macam like
eh then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting ah like err summer panas so like the material lain and then winter sejuk and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then I also think about orh the money
and then also like the rumah like
um we have to have heated floors ke heated jamban atau katil ke
lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil kan bila kita tidur like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about oh so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
so untuk saya untuk saya ya untuk for me right I want to bring them to
flower species and then can can exist all in one place habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada four seasons every country not ah countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since kita takde four seasons kita boleh lah kita pergi gardens by the bay kan to look at the different flowers and also different uh month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
family is it poor family happy family ah sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like wow so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like err last time it was easy to get right tapi sekarang macam like
mana eh nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda modern so macam I pun fikir lah like wah how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also macam not so complicated and then also about games
um nanti kalau like if you bring tourists over to play games kalau kita tak berbual the same bahasa pun takpe because you know you just gitu gitu gini gini then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed lah I also like reality uh so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like wow so this can happen in real life ah then like because like macam I'm quite curious lah on like
people story tapi takkan macam I nak keluar habis tanya orang eh jadi macam mana you punya life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people punya
jalan hidup without being so kaypoh about it
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like tengok dia orang macam like kitchen nightmare dia punya
ah chef of the restaurant then dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak gordon ramsay pun bantu dia punya restaurant kasi betul this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so macam err
naive and like oh or tapi uh
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so macam senang nak percaya and then tapi like when I watch this also I can feel sad lah because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and macam they cannot dapat that connection dalam real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing macam have you experienced something like that or like
for me my favourite movie banyak juga lah tapi macam ada satu jadi ada satu movie ni yang I suka
macam my kat my handphone kat tepi jadi I tengah buka my computer jadi tangan tu I took out a keyboard my kepala facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
tengok I tu tengah macam ah bekerja ni eh tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata I tu tengah tengok bollywood kat tepi tu
and like cerita bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
I think uh also the thing about watching this uh a lot of times with different people right it makes me uh find out more about err the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan ah then dia orang akan pick up different things that you didn't see
picked up in this movie so I think macam gitu it's quite cool to like tengok err with lain orang ah to see macam dia orang punya perspective tu semua ya and then like um
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like uh this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like wah damn cool leh macam macam and then like
mm I pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini so it's actually dari sana lah tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive lah it's like
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also macam quite interesting
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually bila I dengar soundtrack
sometimes when I watch movies also lepas saya tengok movie tu I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know uh how the song sound like all that ya what what
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes kerana saya seorang yang tamak
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace jadi pasal err
lebih ramai lah jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati blah blah blah and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like masuk dalam and I pakai baju and I tengok cantik ke tak eh and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park wow I don't have to queue eh
do wanna be invisible because macam quite
uh apa ni freeing lah ya freeing then err nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so kan I can beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa I kan pasal tak nampak pun ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni mahal lah satu tahun lima puluh ribu so you imagine kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu uh
err ribu puluh ribu kali tiga it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
yang tu caranya a lot of money so then and then uh I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like uh I remember uh
saudara where they had to lay antara dapat duit bursary atau budak tu move on to a better education so kalau budak tu dapat duit bursary maknanya dia kena stay in
uh not so not the best education untuk dia and then if that that budak goes on to uh a better education he might not get
uh the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education macam it helps to break poverty cycles lah
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they ah have to choose between these two and both are important right ah yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran ya oh ya another thing actually very important uh
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay kita pergi dia punya uh apa ni petrol station nak pergi toilet nak pergi toilet tak kat ah
ah petrol station dia nampak tak dia punya jamban so many different
okay so my friends and I kita selalu berbual how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies tapi kita tetap couldn't kerja because kita perlukan duit right
oh ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right macam people ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening err she has made a lot of friends eh from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya
eh awak sini berkebun eh then they ask her eh can I join or not like
for me my hobbies has always been arts lah I really like arts whether it's like macam music atau
makeup eye makeup lukis ke apa kan it's very fun and like uh I think about hobbies
see like uh what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right jadi apa you punya favourite lagu eh
apa-apa genre lah
kalau lagu melayu kan lagu melayu I ingat macam more
to bahasa indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff lah I think my bahasa indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia kan macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam memory lah dia nak simpan memory tu dia tak nak lupakan uh actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs lah and it's also by an artist that I really like uh actually last year the dia ada datang singer last year maybe last year atau dua tahun lepas dia datang singapore tapi I tak tak pergi alamak
what about like live music err pernah ada pergi tak dengan experience ke tak live music
concert yang macam paling memorable tu dengan my sister juga ah ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok coldplay oh actually an interesting thing about this was uh
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right jadi dia orang nak jual at
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable lah tapi dia punya bila part beli tiket itu pun memorable but in a sedih punya memory ya
oh ya I mm what about macam mm ni punya fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then pasal
setiap orang kan ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you uh ya do you believe in love at first sight
apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik eh
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this ciri-ciri jadi I suka orang ni lah
pelik ya
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish mm how can I don't know about dish lah but I think right for I kan you know my mesti I pilih okay antara syrup limau atau teh O ais limau
ya I think uh like teh O ice also I mean you can minum panas it stays great and then you can minum sejuk it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu lah mungkin ada tapi I tak tahu ya and oh so um
err apa ni kat airport tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan my makan tengah hari pun
sikit jer I think maybe just err what do they eat japchae ah japchae I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate japchae japchae is noodle ya ya
very big ah so I if I were to reach there I calculate lah like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the kedai tutup then mesti lapar kan so I remember I I I only bought kacang
habis tu I only ate in taiwan
in singapore for tourist place right I like to go nature ya cause I like to relax jadi bila I nampak pokok I nampak
uh air air tenteram I tak fikir banyak I boleh dengar
I boleh tengok dia punya warna walaupun warna dia hijau jer but like there's so many different colours of green
ya like macam bunga-bunga pun
cantik very delicate
and then everybody macam just bersenam dalam dia punya taman
kau buat apa the whole day
then bila I dapat tahu yang dia akan cerai with dia punya uh isteri right
actually I don't know asal dorang break up ah eh asal dorang nak
cerai everything
at that point of time yang aku rasa macam wow he found the one
it was just berapa tahun yang lalu
and I rasa macam
kalau I Bella I pun maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
ya they got back together I think time bulan ramadan I think they got back together that which make me feel macam
don't ah jangan lah judge and everything then I was like oo okay
actually that time I terserempak dia then when I saw him right
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel kesian cause he looks very like
entah lah maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time I know ah dia kena tangkap pergi karaoke dengan like other girls
buat kot cause like
ya I mean no harm trying ah sebab if you tak try then you'll never know what
from ten to twelve I have like uh group consultation then from twelve onwards is um ten minute consultation with my professor then after that dah balik
no lah like I can balik but at the same time macam I got like macam this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
uh should be kat rumah lah cause sekolah like
ya no fast err there's only one halal malay stall which is ayam penyet
but it's okay lah cause like most of my classes dia online
so kalau online then I just
okay lah bila I first datang right
I feel a bit macam intimidated
asal you tak sabar I thought that
kalau you habis kerja then you don't know what what you gonna do with life
to have like a sense of security kat sana
ah cause I rasa lonely kat sekolah
macam cause most of kita nya classes online kan then dorang macam kita macam tak ada that common like bonding for us to make friends and ni ni semua
the example eh macam kau ada assignment due on week seven
dorang dah habis week
macam kanchiong habis
dorang actually kat sekarang
ah nama dia start with letter L
and dia punya kawan uh I think nama dia start letter B
you know I I nak beli baju daripada Shein you know Shein
I tak ada baju seh pergi sekolah
although I pergi sekolah dua hari jer every week
in your like situation memang susah nak save tau actually
for like kerja kan is just for you untuk
maybe one hundred you simpan
you know I rasa macam this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I I rasa macam I've been a snorlax for so long
then sekarang macam
dah bangun kena kerja keras pula tu
you know I feel kan untuk present kita nak beli present untuk lelaki memang susah sebab
lelakinya present selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu because lelaki dorang macam very practical
cause eh I haven't finish cakap lah
okay then takpe kot
can buy him sabun
ya I mean if you want it easy then just baju eh then just uh perfume lah
uh I think it's okay it's just sometimes dia very busy
but at the same time I rasa dia boleh lah
takde lah I mean
that time he met Dakshah also sebab I tak free
huh I very like packed with a lot of things eh I got I struggling with school takde time ah
but it's really difficult to ajar him seh cause
parents dorang tak tahu tau yang actually macam mana nak handle budak-budak and everything
and then they just like feel yang cikgu yang akan
betul kan budak-budak punya pelajaran and stuff but
is very taxing penat seh
I ah boleh
ya I mean people always cakap alah jer pe
to secondary and secondary is like macam
I'm kind of thankful yang kita pergi a secondary school
yang not that macam
wah like you can really see macam mana orang turn out to be seh
and all the mats and minahs and
the fact that they start smoking even during macam lower sec and doing a lot of other things
actually I scared seh sebab you know uh recently I nampak kat news kan macam
budak kecil right eh not budak kecil ah like just like lower secondary everything
dorang um they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase eh like it's damn
oh primary school pun
social media ah macam TikTok
and I just tak faham ah cause like I remember that time
err ada cikgu ni dia datang kat
me and then macam cakap lah like ah jangan buat malu keluarga ah jaga maruah keluarga
and then dia macam cakap ah macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua then I just feel that err they don't really understand
cause secondary school kan kita tak pernah lambat seh kita cuma lambat on the last day of school
Afif tak pernah lambat ah
dia pun lagi satu toxic nya orang dalam hidup
cause of her macam
ya I cannot seh dia seriously something wrong with her
I mean if you realize like those macam
there were like macam camne nak cakap eh
mm you know I rasa kan the best coach yang I ada right was actually my Singapore poly nya coach they were really like
and although I macam tak datang training atau I not that good kan dorang still never stop believing in me seh
and then dorang always cakap macam oh Ayra you can do this blah blah blah like that
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise kan actually tak healthy gila seh
flowers kenapa you ingat birthday I ke
I suka um
actually I suka mixed ah you know I'm over the years I get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right I keep looking at macam
I mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever nanti dorang letak dalam satu bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower yang macam yellow colour everything then you have like macam
blue colour of flowers and I and then macam ada purple sikit and then I rasa macam oh my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a macam
you know macam brown packaging gitu
oh actually kan I takut seh nak simpan flowers so I I hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday
ya that time bila I simpan flowers kan banyak cicak masuk bilik I seh
cicak lipas then flies
but you know ah I don't know if you pernah dengar there's this cafe called Antea Social
and then they sell like cakes ah oh my god bila I nampak I macam whoa macam sedap jer
macam nak pergi seh but confirm mahal
if I cannot like macam give birth or what right
I should be open to having anak angkat ah cause like
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel macam tak comfortable
ya I tak comfortable I think in a way because like
someone punya
kenapa would you consider
but would you nak would you simpan like cat or whatever pet
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can ah pelihara like
kucing when I dah besar but when I think about it right
I don't know seh it really depends ah whether I have time to jaga them or not
oh my god actually right last time I pergi rumah kawan I cause dia ada rabbit
and then like macam
dorang bising tau
I okay with zoo seh cause I feel yang macam
uh ya it's true ah yang dorang patut be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that
oh my god adik I think you're thinking too much eh
cause like I mean it's a zoo what dorang confirm jaga punya
oh my god I nak pergi

I makan chocolate lah makan apa lah
eh you know kalau you tengok like advertisement everything right they always have like
uh toothpaste right like banyak gila right actually by right it's too much seh actually it's just supposed to be like macam one thin layer on your toothbrush and that is enough

ya I know I know I know macam ibu punya
eh tak basuh
tapi asal dia build differently is it sebab I I met the brothers in uni
tak the point is if you
tak mandi tak apa asalnya tak bau tau then you have to constantly check yourself what personal hygiene macam
gosok gigi ah please you know like last time like I kerja my supervisor
dia macam jenis yang macam oral hygiene like she don't care it's a she by the way she don't care dia macam ada tahi tahi
exactly exactly so macam kalau personally
it's okay tau macam normal lah you terselit spinach kan
ah leh macam tahi gigi on the surface macam from biofilm
and then when she drink coffee so she drink right and then the coffee stuck at the tahi gigi and then she will talk she will talk and talk and sometimes like was it serious
anyways it's like so macam mana she just talk to me
macam apa eh
itu because kaira focus gila because of her teeth oh my god macam habis kadang-kadang I think kawan kakak and then my friend my colleague also understand so she also want to laugh
asal dia gari emas eh
oh my god kakak tahu macam pakai yang macam itu rasa macam rimas gila eh like there's something on my finger
I don't know I think after a while you get used to especially kan the fake punya stuff
eh tapi cantik I think it's fine ah macam in life you have to experience all these
but it's fine kakak punya tan line masa tu dah lama I think dalam masa dua bulan tan line tu hilang and then like it starts again because that
I was having my menses second day so I morning tu bila ibu tiba-tiba message tau
eh ibu dekat luar rumah
tiba kan
then after that actually actually was abang lukman wanted to go to puncak to eat and then he actually told me kita cycle lah but then I say you gila ke because my bicycle is like macam
half can make it half cannot because that time ah we cycle all over and then my bicycle chain just terkeluar
then I panic ah then oh oh my god okay nasib baik abang lukman ada ah
then hari tu that day she suddenly ibu dekat luar pintu then like then after that thank god I baru habis mandi tau so I just open door
then it ibu dan ayah masuk ah and then ibu layan ayah to go for cycling then because ibu and ayah they are waiting then abang lukman just
then just say abang dengan ayah dekat luar kita pergi cycle lah tak baik macam cause we bunga ayah that time jauh pe naik
then he say oh my god K fine then we go so bila I pergi tu
um okay the thing is abang lukman belajar kan dia tidur pukul macam semalam pukul tiga empat pagi
no dia yang belajar and kakak tidur dia orang sembilan dah dah boleh bangkit and do his
I pukul sebelas pun macam macam kena langgar lori
pukul err sebelas setengah begitu
ya at first and then but then have to wait cause abang lukman berak lama
like thirty minutes later then abang lukman keluar then err we siap-siap and then we go but then I in in macam that chaos and that excitement I terlupa nak err makan breakfast
so I cycle all the way ah daripada sini terus sampai faiz and it was okay I was okay sampai dekat faiz the moment I stand up
uh darah keluar and then after I'm like oh my god terus macam kakak punya ini macam diri macam nak pengsan
then after that um habis tiba-tiba kakak punya vision macam half ah oh my god it was the worst and I thought cause macam overheated panas habis tak makan I a bit uzur
and then after that ah we balik ayah dengan ibu continue to marina bridge
lepas tu balik daripada tu um like kakak pengsan gila macam even bila dah habis makan right
when we were sitting there I am so exhausted like halfway through when dekat yang dekat faiz tu at the caldecott there's like a small
tak boleh cycle I can't like kakak macam terhuyung-hayang and I so panas so I took the air botol and then I pour my
ah macam just just basah and then and then because I cycle and then I wear serkup cause normally I cycle I no wear serkup but cause got ibu mah later ibu scold me
aiya so I wear serkup ah
it's the damn serkup
tapi tak lawa nanti macam pakcik err a'ah
habis macam bawah lawa cause I was wearing my what's that exam T shirt and the nice pant tiba-tiba atas macam kepala sotong
and then kalau masuk mall you have to open mah
your sun hat kirakan macam gila pe sebab I muka nampak apa cause like bulat
tau kalau you that macam muka macam ada mix sikit lawa ah maybe it's acceptable
but our our asian features are just you know ya we can't rock those like macam turban look
I think we have like face feature our face feature macam like for example macam we small like small face and then we have high cheekbone
have high yours and mine is the same what high cheekbones right it's only your hidung besar
so you should press it because last time you always listen to kakak aimah kakak aimah don't like
ah hidung mancung cause he say cause he say hidung tinggi nanti sombong like literally peribahasa hidung tinggi then I was like what the hell
ya so he she always penyek then you always macam hidung kata you just like okay ya ya like that
abang long shape his nose
it's like those like macam perfect macam mancung habis kat sini macam ada sikit habis macam lawa for an
ah for an asian guy so and then because I also ibu also always like you know ibu hidung mancung ah cause atuk is like indian or whatsoever
ah ya whatever so ibu got that hidung mancung mah
then ibu always say hidung hidung penyek cause follow ayah mah so serious I always like picit my hidung cause I want
um hidung mancung then after that I always thought my hidung was big
macam I don't know like macam because like orang keep on saying macam ibu keep on saying hidung besar hidung besar so
so ya lah you tahu when hidung bawang macam bawang bawang gila
bawang ah ya
macam nek onah eh bukan eh nenek
ah ya atuk jer macam handsome kan
I mean uncle zair tak tahu kalau handsome time muda
ah macam okay macam kak mira dengan amsyar
dekat nur and eh ah nur and
so then after that I tak nanti I think I met abang lukman abang lukman say I got small nose
like one of the small nose and like quite mancung for a malay lah then I was like oh I didn't know that
ya but it's still considered small tengok macam tak
apa mermaid man
but then it's like kecil then oh it's actually small and then when now when I look at the mirror
oh it's actually average looking nose it's not that bad you know like what you picture cause I last time I always thought I gemuk
exactly because ayah ayah keep on saying uh
uh gemuk gemuk jangan makan nanti gemuk faham tak so it's like macam daripada kecil you have that body yang gemuk but then padahal you tak cukup makan
ya it's not the normal beras apa
and then aku tak tahu sekarang tapi
tapi macam kakak rasa sekarang kadang-kadang macam I can do it
then bila I stayed at his parents I timbang I was forty nine
lepas tu it was just like

maybe like don't have plan but maybe dia mak and ayah use car
tak happy eh tapi kan ada minimum
tapi yes mah eh bapa dia nampak demam sikit
masa tu habis masa dah tak ada so semua ni lepas tu tukar jadi babat
habis that day I I took photo and then I send to his ayah lah then I cakap makin tembam budak ni
a'ah habis apa ayam ayam ayam everything ayam kalau tak ada ayam daging
mesti pun hantu ayam because kalau kakak beli macam daging ke atau apa kalau kak masak kakak makan sikit so macam bazir so might as well I cook whatever he wants to eat which is
sahaja luckily your face don't turn into chicken
um habis but then you skin will be saggy
kentang chicken
ya aiya kau ni mahal mahal juga aiya tak tahu nenek cakap satu meal berapa tau beberapa keping ayam
adik tahu satu packet um ayam satu packet ayam berapa satu packet ayam dua paling murah is seven dollar forty five cent
dia lepas tu tanya dia berapa banyak berapa banyak pieces tu ah boleh dapat thirty six
ah separated kalau is thirty six wings chicken drumsticks dengan wing atau lapan belas set of drumstick that is how much tau
itu kalau one week adik makan six kan adik boleh tahan selama three
tapi still mahal you tahu semalam yang kan tangan dimakan tu kau tahu itu berapa
ah sebab bersih sangat mampus kan
I thing is ah I think ah ayah dan ibu even the chicken I mean ah sorry it's not that nice
macam what is the flavour
no she's good at cooking but she like masak but she don't like to taste her food
ah is abang home already
sebab because living room itu baru if you make dekat tu also so it's nicer for him whereas the bilik kan macam dah tunggang pecah if you understand
in the point of macam healing kan it's so much better to be in a clean and newer environment rather than macam old you understand
kena buat partition lah ayah kena panggil buat partition
buat lah partition
that house that house is so big it has so many potential tapi macam
ah recognise or macam ayah eh ayah ayah dah tak kuasa nak keluarkan duit untuk renovate and then ibu pula malas nak maintain so macam oh my god
macam they they put the effort to
cause ayah will start something and then he he will expect ibu to follow up with it
macam dah lapuk is so outdated already I think twenty years it was okay but now it's
why so degil one ah
ya can you imagine kalau rumah aku buat ambin dalam bilik tu nah
kadang-kadang nak buat ambin tapi nak buat yang macam japanese style
ah ya ya ya macam lawa macam just like platform it doesn't need to be a permanent just you can buy the platform is have that one then you just put your bed on top I think quite nice eh macam those
oh is it but you baring if you put your
tilam only if you put your tilam ah
the bawah is literally err
err apa ni like err literally like that tapi tak rasa
you don't feel it ah the only thing bad about that thing right they literally macam blew the papan onto the floor
so kalau macam in the future kalau nak macam shift shift but you can't shift it is like that
but I love a lot of things about japan especially macam dia orang
macam kecil macam dia orang punya design of barang macam macam kecil and it's so efficient in my opinion
so kakak cakap suka gila that time when we went to
kyoto ah then there's daiso a huge ass daiso and then beside it there was like a furniture kedai perabot
I think they literally jual macam one set macam sinki yang ni dan dia punya
cabinet atas dengan cabinet bawah dengan lampu dia dengan dia punya segala-gala lah dia punya there is literally one unit
and boleh masuk bathtub
can you imagine how amazing that is that's like this this this toilet ah macam bodoh sia
why can't they put the jamban and the sink side by side then we have a long ass
jamban just put together right oh my god
why they never think about it I don't know how they design it is so like so bodoh like even the tingkap this one ah
ni kan kalau rumah lama is dekat atas pe
this like for example kalau macam hujan but then you still want air ventilation you can open up the top windows mah then get air in
this one you open you can open the first one on top if you open the below air hujan masuk it's like so bodoh I don't know what are they thinking when designing the house
tapi ini macam bodoh macam bodoh gila
rumah juan yang dekat uh uh huh
macam lawa macam it looks like a bedroom macam ni it looks like a fucking bedroom right no fucking storeroom I don't know it's so weird
the jemuran eh
they don't even know what is inside the kotak right
ah ya but like I think if you wanna buy your furniture macam tu if ikea stuff don't buy on the kedai itself pergi carousell
jual and then jual dia harga macam murah gila babi yang itu macam apa seh dining table dua puluh aku beli dua ratus
so macam geram gila macam ini set alarm right um we bought this two hundred and forty
ah macam banyak
ya kau macam eh sakitnya hati ya allah ya
so macam tak perlu seh I mean like the thing macam almari ni seven hundred whereas we can actually bought it at
brand new lagi just have to fucking dismantle it and it is still very cheaper than buying a
itunya macam menyesal so kadang-kadang kan just buy from carousell
I mean yang paling biasa I carousell kadang-kadang dia ada kasih dengan free items eh
apa add on
tak free stuff macam orang kasih free orang nak macam just siapa-siapa nak ambil free ah macam give away
what tu apa
call of duty ini pasal apa eh

ya I I I've seen it before someone cook like macam beef rose
january to april but which is kalau aku pergi dekat january on in january right then I finish school in april I can extend my stay there what
yes and then kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan kan
ya different dia tak ada then three years her course was just three years
so dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana
india pun ada north india
tak nak malas because very expensive what
uh that one aku dah check semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil
and then bawah itu ada spain I think semua
so pergi or I or I pergi
ada orang kita tahu ke do we know anyone in the
ah apa nama tu
it's like a feature wall belakang katil
satu nak macam like that
then depan dia you want to put your projector or what then it's up to you lah
nak frame apa
might as well paint sendiri kan terus tampal amacam
I don't want to put something like you know macam frame
kena kat kepala tengah tidur sakit sial
confirm sakit
confirm sakit
I thought you want to tear down the wall and then taruk dining room
eh dining room pula dining table
entrance tu kan nak buat ah ni
nak buat banyak raised floor
it does so that macam if let's say orang datang
orang duduk kat atas raised floor tu kan macam lepak ke baring-baring ke
a'ah eh orang daripada luar boleh nampak eh
mmhmm nanti jadi
kaum puak eh
nak buat raised floor tak dekat sebelah tingkap
on anzari had ada ah
okay how about that room the first bedroom tu
kita buat yes kita buat raised floor
and then kita
buat bilik tu macam our workstation
ya it's like macam
it's it's a macam mana nak cakap eh
okay dia
raised floor dia sampai dekat tingkap tu so that kita boleh baca kat atas tu kita boleh duduk kat atas tu kita boleh lepak
where you can even baring lah senang cakap boleh boleh tidur lah kat situ
and then dia tak tinggi sangat dia tak rendah sangat
correct so if you can either duduk or you can even baring
but it's near the tingkap lah then bawah tu can put books or maybe kita boleh taruk maybe some
apa drawer or something like that
okay remember bilik tu ada ada almari
yang almari yang built-in
pecah kan
we we make a table macam yang
ah or either way lah mana mana nya side lah so that is where our
ah apa nama dia
laptop and our workstation ah senang cakap
then at the side maybe we just pasang satu
ah satu apa nama dia
satu swing yang mount dekat daripada ceiling
we don't mount dekat ceiling lah then we buy the the one that with stand
we get the swing yang you know yang facing each other punya
you know the one yang kita lepak dekat
nanti swing tu goyang sendiri
tutup lah pintu jangan masuk masa I tak ada
no lah I mean the swing yang satu tapi the stand okay pe
if we are going to workout kat rumah
okay then maybe okay then maybe satu
ah for us to run ke apa ke
if I want to go for weights then I go to the gym yang dekat tu
alah then tak ada swing
tak lah swing tu tak bergerak sendiri lah
atau swing taruk dekat living room ah living room lagi nampak
the yang
mount nak kena pay extra eh
mount cuba kalau because if we mount kita tak boleh alih-alih kan
why do I want to alih-alih kan
if let's say ya macam like macam kat rumah awak
kan macam mak
from this side then dia nak change to the other side
ah lepastu ni sekarang dia nak change to this side balik
ah macam dia boleh change tapi kalau dah mount
dah tak boleh tukar dah tak boleh ubah
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down mana nak taruk tu
boleh memang betul but then
dekat wall the other side is not
wooden wall faham tak
dia boleh alih even with the console dia boleh alih
okay kalau kita ada console
we can move it to the window macam my house
ya okay pasal my house dia tak mount kan then on on top the console pe
ah so dia boleh alih-alih
so from there dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat wall atau dia boleh dekat this wall
so you can you can actually macam if let's say this year you nak macam gini then next year you nak macam gini
ah tukar mood you know tukar tukar tempat ke
it it might you know we don't know which which one yang
kena dengan kita pe
no lights can just tampal belakang jer
so the light shine dekat tembok
so it it if kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang lah dia tak shine
dia boleh shine boleh boleh shine tapi tak nampak sangat ah
but if you put on the wall kalau ah facing the wall
then the the light will show apa
will memacarkan
dekat wall
of course lah tak lah
tu dah colour colour
no okay macam let's say sini
putih eh
then sini macam grey
and then sini putih sini grey
so that it will look macam apa tau how to say eh
because your okay because you said you don't want the colour to lari jauh pe it's medium grey and light grey
so okay if you even if you put it together macam gini dua dua and then in the middle you taruk
you campur dua dua
and then you go and paste ah macam
mm mm ya ya tapi satu tub one whole big tub tu tak cukup satu rumah
kalau one whole house is about two
yang besar yang as in tub besar gitu tau
ah yang the one yang sikit hari ayah bawa balik ah yes correct that one two
kalau for the whole house
it depends on the colour juga
so yang chalk nya is like macam
susah nak hilang ah
oh macam macam you know the pagar yang colour hijau tu
pakai chalk sudah normal one
dia jatuh takut belakang tali dia pasang tali tali putus jatuh kat kepala kita sakit kan
might as well just tampal
tampal tak okay tampal dia boleh cabut
so in a dia tak stay permanently
I thought living room you don't want to put ayat-ayat
eh kentalnya tak nak ah
frame is so old school seh tak nak ah don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want
but if you put frame dah macam rumah pakcik makcik
tu jer I can say it looks modern but if you put it in a frame it looks old school
faham tak then that is a different story
okay then kat bilik ah
see kat bilik pun tak nak
so nak kena ada pergi balik
okay is it ayat as in ayat from the al-quran or ayat is just macam words of wisdom
since awak tak nak nampak sangat eyesore sangat kan why not put it in the dining room
where got tembok
masuk rumah is just tembok kecil sikit jer
ah tembok kecil sikt lepastu dah pagar pagar pagar pe
tembok tu I think I want to macam panjang kan sikit ah
then the yang yang satu satu satu tu nak buang
but then kita tak ada if like that then kita tak ada store
I know so I thought if let's say kita dah masuk then we make that store we make it as a store
and then our dining room kita kecil kan sikit ah sebab meja besar gila ah meja dia boleh duduk berapa enam tujuh lapan sepuluh orang boleh duduk
I don't know whether we still need store room tak because barang-barang besar kotak-kotak apa ke nak simpan
kita beli vacuum like vacuum punya kotak you know that kind of thing
then kotak-kotak tu nak simpan
okay so we kita akan kecil kan that dining room
so that masuk boleh jalan kat dalam
atau sini taruk barang aje then sini boleh jalan
nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu ah I mean I think by next year I think next year kita dah boleh buat ah
bomb shelter is semua rumah baru
kita nya bomb shelter is kat bawah blok
bomb shelter kat bawah
yang tempat budak-budak ah sekolah tu nursery ah that one is bomb shelter
ada uh I think kat bawah
mm tapi dia buat macam
I don't know lah but I don't think ada orang occupy that room
ah flat yang ada bomb shelter
ya because my flat ni ada bomb shelter untuk orang-orang yang macam macam daripada blok sebelah
blok sebelah ah nak lari
second room is macam taruk
maybe kita cantik kan sikit ke atau do some cleaning on it
so we just I think just guest room atau tempat orang nak solat ah dah
if let's say orang nak solat ah
even kalau dekat dalam study room tu orang nak solat pun boleh
kecil ah
but okay lah should be okay lah macam bilik amni
mm bilik amni is like that
ya kita nak taruk dia kat situ is katil yang
for now maybe my single bed ah single bed taruk sana dulu
because kalau
satu orang jer boleh tidur
tak kan satu nak tidur bawah satu tidur atas kan
takpe lah just
apa nama dia mm
katil queen-sized
just masukkan satu katil queen-sized
tapi nak kena swee swee kira menghadap
gitu lah so ada space a lot more space
so can solat down there
eh awak punya handphone macam jauh jer
tak tahu dengar ke tak lah but
because down there dorang dah buat
uh apa nama dia
dah buat almari kat situ
okay the the almari is L shaped
ah camne nak cakap eh it's like macam okay ni tiga room
letak sini dua then satu dua tiga
ah faham tak
rather than I have that might as well ada one two three
then one two three then in the middle put cermin
that place kita buat walk-in wardrobe
that short yang dia cakap yang the one that you say is short walkway tu kan
ah that one kita buat walk-in wardrobe ah instead of dia buat macam gitu L shaped
we tambah lagi satu gini tapi yang tu yang dalam tu the one inside
kita pecah kan
three macam gini
ah this like this wardrobe but three macam gini ah ni this is three
tak tak tak this dua pintu is three inside
then kat bawah sini ada
ah laci correct ah that one is one two three
then in the middle I want to put macam baju gantung untuk kat atas tu gantung panjang
from here to here sampai hujung
gantung tapi in the middle I want to put macam satu drawer
apa nama dia ah macam taruk jam jam ke
ah jam jam ke ah your accessories ke
can see through apa nama dia panggil tu
cermin eh not cermin
kat situ ah
because it's two faham tak it's two
so tempat siap is tengah tengah sini and then depan sini is ah
apa yang got space to walk of course lah got space to walk
got space to walk maksudnya
unless I want to take my baju lah
tak kan tak boleh tepi sikit tepi sikit
tak kan tak boleh
tepi sikit no
so kalau gini jalan senget
boleh pe
so the cermin okay the the ya is like this cermin
exactly beside that macam table macam gini tapi rendah sikit with a cermin
if you don't want cermin also can
then just satu table jer lah kat situ
satu table macam gini ah
like this kind ah like macam this this kind of laci ah
corner seat okay juga
then bawah ni semua is not our stuff
boleh juga up to you
can this one you want to take out pun boleh pecah kan taruk yang glass
but then not nice lah kan dalam kalau berselerak abeh orang macam mm
definitely berselerak
then the katil
my side dekat dengan tingkap
or you want to dekat dengan tingkap which one
then my side of the bed ada satu meja kecil jer bukan meja macam gini
dia meja kecil jer
bed side table pun boleh lah
mm then in sorang is a
ah apa taruk projector kan
kat mana nak taruk projector tu
tak ya your projector will project the image on the wall but where do you want to put the projector
you want to gantung dekat ceiling
or you want to gantung dekat atas katil
no lah I mean buat satu macam
not rak ah ya maybe rak
buat satu macam rak gitu then taruk kat situ
somewhere around here pun
waste of space might as well you just tampal tampal tampal everything on your
murah punya ah
if five room berapa how much harga dia
if four room berapa harga dia
tapi dia cakap five room
not my pasal what
correct what not my pasal what
tak tahu pula eh
if malaysia boleh
we also boleh mah
mm tak ada apa
check lah we check like macam bawah bowl ke bowl seat bowl tu ke apa ke
tak lah I think the sanitisation tak include cleaning ke
ah apa nama dia they will have a
jet no they don't need the jet spray you nak
dia nak scrub apa lantai
ye they have that they have that apa nama dia
I nak minum hot chocolate dulu
okay so kita memang dah tak
meat products as much as we did before I mean dua ribu dua belas eh dua ribu dua puluh dah kind of okay
so how how far lang nak go in to into veganism
I rasa
tapi in a way I think we're almost
I rasa
tapi I rasa I macam ada
selfishness sebab I don't
feel the same thing bila macam guna ikan bilis just because they are smaller than a chicken or lembu
ah I rasa selfish sebab they should be equal
ya ya ya faham mukbang
a'ah in a way lah sebab
I mean orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing is our companion pet banyak orang guna sebagai ah ada anjing as pet
manja lah binatang tu can be so is that the same comparison
tapi kita start dengan err hunting and gathering food from ah natural resource macam
dia pergi memburu semua kan then baru come this era bila orang start berkebun and jumpa teknik berkebun
wah I tak ingat
jadi kalau you nak go into veganism you akan
be a vegan lah bukan vegetarian
telur I cannot leave that I mean I
I boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu but I feel like I need my protein daripada telur
tapi the challenge
ah you I tak sure tapi I
the challenge will come bila balik rumah mama
masak apa yang dia masak lah I don't think I have the strength to tolak
because it's not something yang I boleh dapat every day
I I can do that kalau pergi kedai kawan
tapi kalau balik rumah family dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan
but I myself don't have the strength to tolak apa yang dah ada tu ah
ah and sebab I tahu
so susah ah
you macam mana
apa yang spark your idea untuk
err timeline ke
yang membuat you sampai ke part yang mana you nak jadi vegan ni ada cerita dia ke
macam cringe cringey
I rasa
yang betul-betul macam the moment yang spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
and because of a lot of things eh yang you bagi tau I lah and dia macam I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan kan sebab we have abundant soy sauce we have that err we have abundant soy derived products macam tempeh tauhu
mm sedap jer
ya lah sebab kita crave
spread penyakit ke macam nyamuk you you never know which one yang gigit you yang bawa aedes
extreme lah I mean I I think dua hari lepas kot I kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi
selain delving into veganism apa you punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu
kalau ada lah
I think ada kot
I rasa I rasa I punya azam tahun ni I nak
sebab I dah lama sangat tinggalkan drawing and sekarang I rasa janggal nak buat the kind of drawing yang I pernah buat dulu
janggal gila sampai sampai macam halfway tu dah menyampah tau
tapi tapi I I tau lah kalau kalau practise every day
dia makin lama makin okay so that's one of my
lepas tu I nak
belajar italian
and probably greek as well sebab tu pun dah tinggal quite lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu
um apa lagi eh
I wish I can say yang I nak seriously
belajar music but
but quit susah lah sebab I I don't have the same passion untuk tahu what's behind the system
ah dia not not as fulfilling but
atau maybe about
nak cakap lack of audience pun tak juga ah
even dekat rumah pun
dia macam not as motivated lah untuk untuk pegang musical instruments
just in case tapi kalau dah beli then tak main
apa ah my other resolution
sebab ah before this kita depend on performance and
if we have side jobs yang
then tu macam bonus but by by the end of last year dia dah turn to the other way round
memang ah memang more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way lah because I tak selesa pun untuk keluar and perform and jumpa orang in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still nak ada event takut juga ah
kalau you punya new year resolution apa yang dah boleh tiru dah I punya
berasa macam I nak belajar japanese sebab I tengok food wars tu tapi
better untuk focus dekat
tu lah
tapi so far italian is not that hard I rasa I boleh catch up balik
ah and I suka sebab macam once you belajar italian you can kind of faham french as well dia ada kaitan ah dia dia ada kaitan
quite beneficial untuk learn that one language
sebab dia boleh branch out to bahasa-bahasa lain selain language to apa lagi you punya ni you punya azam
uh I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore cakap the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself dia dah ada everything yang dia nak
I rasa it's not
and then ending pun
you you you you decide the topic pula
apa yang akan jadi in two thousand twenty one ah
I rasa akan ada
for sure sebab in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
ah dia punya
macam musicians tak dapat buat shows
ah ya artist tak boleh buat exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start macam
to make everything better for myself lah sebenarnya especially if that's their only creative outlet
dia redundant it's very redundant
but what about live shows I think um live shows pun dah start ada search juga because um sebanyak yang start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations memang
social distancing code scanning and everything so itu pun I rasa in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
I baca dekat twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
dia orang cakap your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
macam flu or fever side effect yang teruk-teruk
so I think I pun tak walaupun I takut jarum but I don't think I akan stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
ya lah faham
I mean even sekarang masa pandemic pun I dah tak ingat what happened in june in may
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic ni akan berlangsung lama and they cannot depend on skill yang dia orang dah ada so they have to broaden their horizon
okay can you explain pasal stoicism sebab I try baca tapi I macam
apa you punya philosophy philosophical standpoint
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you memang dah
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding tak sama so
once the border buka
scandinavian countries dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama european
bukan yang yang yang tak payah stamp passport tu ah dia tak termasuk dalam schengen countries eh oh termasuk oh then why
tapi I memang curious on how they can manage to provide
what about southeast asia or asia lah in general ada tak yang you nak pergi
ke kita memang western centric
I think sebab I think the the the reason is because
um dia orang preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit macam dekat sini most of them are
tapi asia I
nak pergi tak I nak pergi indonesia but but but the parts yang kita tak pergi before ah
I think tu pun interesting and for some reason
I nak pergi thailand sangat sangat sebab I rasa macam I nak dia punya street food
tu jer kot as for now
ah india but maybe bila umur dah lima puluh nanti lah boulogne and lah
mm selain tu
eh tapi yang tesla buat
the space flight yang you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
kan they dia buat dia buat this err flight flight system baru yang mana you can travel across the world in less than three hours ke two hours a'ah
so I don't know if that is still running sebab dia nak
benda tu affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years ke
balik hari jer pun boleh
I suka that documentary
centric tapi understandable lah sebab creator dia pun from
wah I punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam what do you want
you dah cakap you stoic so I dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu
apa yang you nak change
mm I faham
tapi tu lah I think I learn more
ah dekat dekat internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually kat okay I mean form five pun I don't have
and I tak pakai
hujung form five I pakai iphone but before that I pakai
ada laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use ah but I
I lebih I I understand bila ayah yang ajar
kena ambil to TOEFL lah lagi sekali
tapi tu lah dia punya price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so dia expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until dia expire macam the last time I ambil rugi jer
then sia-sia even if you dapat offer travel while once you nak masuk dia akan minta balik your TOEFL punya sijil then you have to take again
two thousand twenty one ni
kira start of the decade kan
bukan yang two thousand twenty kan last year was the ending
a'ah kita tunggu the fireworks
kita tunggu the fireworks but nothing happen
I pun takde expectation
that that one quite fast tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah
I harap
entah lah I don't have any
poll sekarang
like dia macam
tak dia from semua benda sebab
I tak rasa
macam you tadi cakap lah ah
afterlife punya benda kita tak tahu and it's not within our control kan dan ni pun sama it's not within my control so whatever happens happens lah
apa pun yang dia orang buat I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
tu jer
entah lah
tapi I I'm quite positive about
tak hopeless sangat
it's been awhile since I rasa hopeless dengan
the whole tahun
oh kaum is a very sensitive issue
and I tak suka tengok Facebook comment
dia almost macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu you don't have any feelings at all
ah bangsa malas membaca
lepas tu tajuk everything click bait
ah I wish that kena change
yang tu kena change
but journalism yang spark head
orang yang malas membaca tu ya malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun they have to click in order to know the
ni nurse yang nurse yang yang ni infected tu dekat yang vaksin mm mm
and then kismis dan
mm tapi yang news pasal nurse tu very misleading sebab even if you take your first vaccine untuk dia sampai ke fifty percent immunity tu dia ambil dua minggu
dia kena COVID within I think hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu it's not even two full weeks yet and even kalau dah two full weeks pun not a full total immunity
second shot baru ni tapi
and lagi pun journalisms sekarang mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then jadi satu bentuk berita ah yang penting ada content ya monetisation and yang penting duit jalan K
tapi content memang tak best langsung especially because the audience dalam Twitter and dalam Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
oh dah ni
lagi satu minit there's only one minute left
ah nanti kan bila you dah settle you click right ah tick ah
okay lah macam tak rasa sangat can speak one hour macam tak
penat entah macam okay one of the reason eh sebab secondary school dengan primary school dah habis sekolah tau so macam ah dah nak masuk holiday mindset aku dah macam ah nak holiday nak holiday nak holiday abeh tapi poly masih ada lagi apa nak kena buat kerja ah lagipun during this period ah the exams are like
nak kena apa jaga safe distancing kan so like the exams are out so most of our
so macam and most of the time kan my graded assignment semua kena buat report and for report confirm nak kena buat research banyak
so I had to like research like yesterday I had to research like a banyak benda ah so
macam by the time dah habis sekolah macam ah dah dah aku dah penat aku dah penat and nak balik rumah one hour journey macam just the thought about it dah buat aku penat and when I came home
I submit lah but it was like ah macam
half half macam macam fifty percent punya reflection journal a'ah ya it was just a fifty fifty then I just submit
ya itu jer abeh like
like you saw ah macam I just macam mandi terus tidur terus lepak habis oi
eh but your poly days macam lagi rabak because
like creativity like err macam ah
no because three point one is more of macam internship tau and these tuesday ada briefing on the internship ah and then
like honestly I'm actually afraid of it macam I don't know because macam okay macam I don't know eh because of your experience I don't know even though like you're experienced kau macam put it in a beautiful way
tapi tapi just the thought of um having like supervisor I just okay the reason I'm really afraid of industry is I cannot do something that they passed me to do
okay I think I would like love to be in that situation because the internship is at home no I mean err ya it was at home so like but quite like mendak macam like err no err so like
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that yang assigned dia through
I don't know lah dia tak elaborate ah but but yeah it was mostly a research
dia datang for like one two days first two days leh then the period starts
no ya for especially year ones because ya I had a friend in year one okay first kan orientation they cut off so like they couldn't like macam familiarise the building ya because during orientation right I like at least I can get the glimpse of how the things work over there how to go to this building how to go to that building tapi for my friend right the orientation is cut off so she never even like even like
macam gitu ah so like and kan dorang like most of my kawan yang year ones
dorang like
like suddenly they had to use microsoft teams and the ah school punya website
so macam
and for us like year two and year threes like we already like accustomed to like the the school website like how to download things how to submit things but year one they like clueless so like most of my friends here from year one they had a terrible semester one like first year ya and they couldn't like communicate okay like for someone that you meet online for the first time you would be like very awkward right kan so macam dorang macam
how am I supposed to berbual with this person gitu ah
no lah I berbual english because by the time right for my batch dah banyak ada yang ambil tamil gini semua
but then one thing I don't regret I mean I did not regret masuk poly ya but
but I didn't regret masuk poly because like because certain things macam how
okay so aku macam old schools sikit computer I'm not like
I'm not I don't know how to operate a computer ya ya I was I couldn't even I don't even know how to like eject thumb drive that is how kental I am
ya so diam so ah so bila masuk poly tiba-tiba dah kena buat ah share document and all that then I was like apa ni apa ni I don't know I don't know I don't know or like on the first day it was just like macam
like I don't know I don't know ah macam if I think that macam eh
during secondary school I know the like term google docs but I don't know like huh apa ni like what am I supposed to do there ah so macam
no wonder kau selalu pergi library I thought it was to like to baca buku no
since I'm already eighteen right so macam some some things that actually almost all of the things kan kau kat aku
just a small girl so I couldn't even help you I don't even understand like what kind of situation you are in even then so macam I tak boleh tak tolong apa-apa because I just look at the bright side like how you get all these things daripada mami dan abi macam dapat ni dapat tu macam semua benda everything first hand aku selalu dapat second or third hand aku macam I was kind of jealous at that point of time tapi that
macam dengar like what's like actually what happened actually so macam okay lah not deserved lah macam
not deserve lah macam okay lah deserve lah sikit deserve lah
macam messenger facebook
oh secondary three secondary four okay so macam
okay firstly kan since ah okay so the teachers pun macam tahu ah like how they stress on O-level O-level O-level but then right and my classmates semua macam ah heck care macam aku tak nak kesah pun pasal benda ni just it was that bad uh like even like teacher pun macam what
tapi for me right
why not have fun macam macam this is the last few days sebelum like macam like some macam ya macam ya
a good memory lah so like our class macam quite
rabak ah to be honest okay to be honest and okay since I'm the monitress
I couldn't like macam act serabak dorang lah like I couldn't be that rebel or something like that ya and even because and the monitor at that point of time
ah so macam
I had to do most of the things that macam
like attendance ah keep track of apa
dah hantar acknowledgement slip or whatsoever ah so and most of the time even the teachers know that ah
macam tanya monitor they will just go to me monitress so even the monitors the guy together I will be the one yang akan represent the class it was that bad so I had to be like the responsible one so sometimes no I had to be the most responsible ones
it was that bad so macam all of the things that I I had to do on my own because our class only had like around ten guys out of how many students ah twenty nine so nineteen girls and so the ten days and ten guys the responsible ones
tak ada satu pun ah terpaksa ah ah
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years I became the monitor slash monitress secondary one lah the four years lah it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like kakak was the major contribution why I became like the
monitress at that point of time err I don't know leh because ah tapi like they most of the teacher point out ah like I am so different from you and abang ya because both of you can go to like on stage and public speaking or can just go up on stage but for me right I avoid
going on stage or just just presentation in class ya I just I will just avoid it like no matter what macam ya no matter what ah
aku akan avoid at all cost to the point that at one point of time
B three I don't want to tell you tak payah ah so and during secondary three secondary four
well most of us dah macam go through many things so like and sec three sec four ada macam project macam masa tu ada this international is a apa humanitarian job ah so even before that going overseas right
we had to do that fund raising lah so like almost like everyday kita orang stay back and macam pop up macam this one booth kita orang jual air jual roti jual pizza and all
and until like the cost one dollar two dollar but then the thing is it accumulates lah so macam and had a lot of fun lah then bila secondary four okay by the time secondary four semua orang dah tahu that is going to be the last year and this is the last time untuk macam rebel ah bukan rebel ah as in show your true colours to everyone
somehow ah macam and since kita orang dah tahu is our last year kan semua orang makin rapat
and then so macam
even when macam ah the teachers like complain about us and then our class macam ah it's okay it's okay it's our class like that even like the teachers
macam this class macam hais this class like ah ah
but it's actually good memory like even like during stay backs or upper extra class during saturday ya this and there was this one time during one saturday our chemistry teacher showed us err pictures during secondary one secondary two no no it was a chemistry teacher malay guy err male guy male so he showed us during our sec one sec two during our orientation and we were like oh my god you were this lame or you were this short because I had this one guy during secondary one he was like err on my ear ear height by the end of secondary four I am at his ear punya height
eh tak actually I'm like his shoulder shoulder ah so macam everytime right I will like gaduh dengan dia kau dulu pendek then sekarang dia macam sekarang aku lagi tinggi so macam uh geram ah but this kind of memories like macam ah
but to be honest right I couldn't even remember most of my primary school days macam it's just like
A B C D E F ah so macam but some more pressure for being in the top class second top class ah
but then like for the lower class right dorang like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing kesian juga macam like everyone akan tengok ya but then but the thing I hated the most because kita orang the first two class couldn't like they didn't apply us for camp
during primary six no because kita orang macam macam ah okay ah tak payah apex camp no I am more of a person of yang tak suka interact bukan antisocial
cuma I prefer less interaction
boyfriend girlfriend ah ni
kau hold grudge eh
so means dorang stay back longer than kau stay back ah
oh then why didn't you like cakap to your
but I but you guys didn't voice out that it was the primary six punya kerja
but did you realise everytime during camp or macam stay over kat sekolah kan
like most of us are macam tak tidur
oh korang tidur eh
oh no because for my batch right macam everytime kalau ada macam ada qiyam or macam macam sleep kat sekolah kan
selalu like malam kan kita orang tak tidur
kita orang kita orang uh tidur dekat level three the boys tidur dekat level one but then ah toa payoh
ah okay so ah so but then kita orang dekat level three kita orang tengah tidur-tidur tengah berbual berbual ah with the girls ah kita orang berbual ah macam gossip something like that
like dekat parade square running to the school gate then go to the parade square and stand kita orang macam curious ah like why is this guy doing this such a thing like during like it was one in the morning oh one lah
then kita orang semua gather abeh tengok like
I don't know I don't know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly tiba-tiba ada empat orang pun apa lari to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but I don't know what they did ah but I think was something stupid or they did it just like ya I I think that they did it just like tak tidur so the rest kena punishment but then right I think the male teachers like macam
they walk around but for the female teachers right they just slept so like our girls sleep macam tak terganggu with any check
creepy keras
and it was all girls lah but dah tak ada lelaki so ah ah oh then suddenly like two of us macam nak beli makanan and because it was during lunchtime and dah penat ah so okay lah the so it was left with me and another one friend lah kat dalam
suddenly we heard the same thing you know the macam the drain ya
of the another car park yang sebelah Mendaki sense it was the other it was the other side so like there's no car
there should be no car beside us and is at the level one so macam eh
why would I know that's why kita orang dah macam curious then so like err okay actually me and my friend were like talking so macam we heard that sound then we were like
kita orang diam kita orang like give each other a look ah then like okay ah how about we just like macam macam
ah ah kita orang rasa macam how about we err we buy drinks from the vending machine then I was like so kita orang keluar a'ah
add up bila dekat luar baru kita orang macam did you hear that
but to be honest like the chalet or the like house right macam scary like the vibe
and it was like so far from the bus stop and the bus stop pun like quite sunyi
to be honest I've never encountered this type of situation and I don't want to encounter this type of situation ever because to be honest I'm quite a scary cat juga lah
no because because to be honest compared to the both of us kau lagi rabak so I had to be the one yang okay with it so macam ah I cannot
I think it was during the lunchtime lah so macam uh so some of us like went out to
mafia game eh no eh I don't know it was one of the games so we had macam macam ah
bukan application lah it was just a website kita orang ini so kita orang enter macam this group I'm in that kira macam game pin
then the masuk no no it was not telegram it was just a website ah so macam dah gitu so they will assign the mafia or the spy gitu so for that game we had to question each other lah like okay so ah what is this place this place have like
it was the Mendaki side punya Mendaki sense punya side and was the second level and the other corner bukan the corner to parade square the other corner nak masuk hall canteen
err how about we stop this this game because no one tau because we always like eh macam I point like someone else lah it was you then the other guy was no I thought it was you no I thought it was you so we were like who is this ah ah ya that's why we showed our phone lah macam no it's not us tak ada pun tak ada like kita orang tengok kat phone kan
eh all of us are like the macam workers staff at the place tak ada orang the spy
ah no the like no we macam they would like macam is there macam enough players kira macam this is like dah macam start the game so that only the players kira macam even we didn't like say the game pin out loud so macam none of us like
tak ada orang ah boleh suspect[oh no what happen oh because the day before kita orang tengok
during the stay back punya time ah mengundang
because I don't know because like it was like with the class kan so macam the scary movie macam the horror movie macam tak affect tak affect langsung ah
but then the next day it happens so kita orang macam ya
because they have to tap to masuk right
uh like apa with
kunci or was it a lock or oh pin okay
this dengan siapa
okay cakap pasal horror stories right
okay one of my friend have sixth sense dia boleh
like dia boleh nampak a few things like things that you cannot kita orang tak boleh nampak ah
so there was this one time kat dalam class
but then I just sat beside her except because kawan rapat kan no it was in primary school it was ah level eight so the teacher was like teaching okay lah macam biasa
then suddenly my kawan macam eh why is this guy standing outside from just now then I was like
pusing ah pusing tengok then I was like there's no guy there's no one
then I was like because um I'm quite macam rapat juga ah primary six and our class is at the eight level which is the highest level and
ya it's quite macam nanti ada connected to another building and that building quite
kosong there's no one it's empty ya so I was I was turning my head then I was like I saw no one then I was like I macam dah hyperventilate macam apa ini what is happening but um I quite rapat dengan dia so I know that she can see these things lah
again lah if he is he still standing there because mungkin it's just a person like just passing by or something lah going another class or just another parent ke tengah nak tunggu their child I don't know I just thinking a lot of possibilities situation ya then
not so clear like he's like just like macam bayang
and dia pakai baju black clothes clothing don't don't don't don't then okay okay then I ask my friend lah
like imagining stuff on like on my right side of the class so macam no I was supposed to be at end of the side because that was my friend kan so macam I wanted to sit beside her lah teman for that class for that lesson
tak akan nampak that thing macam I just don't want to see that thing macam tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I don't want I don't want I don't want I just avoid looking at that

melayu eh
mostly all chinese I think so melayu pun aku tak tengok
K ada satu jer aku tengok
apa eh
tujuh hari eh tujuh hari mencintai mu is it
aku rasa lah aku pun tak sure
serious satu jer
satu jer the rest I don't like it
dulu what
dulu kita tengok drama together what because there is timing for it what
kan aku pun selalu tengok suratkhabar just to tengok apa show yang ada for the day
and bila nak buka and bila tak payah buka at all
aku tengok that this one facebook post I think aku pun lupa bila
like that's when dia orang tahu that perempuan is actually lelaki they went for
they went for service punya
ya I mean in singapore it's called other countries I don't know but for service ni
seriously dia orang semua like most of the guys seriously they really look like a freaking girl
aku seriously seh
macam dah pernah eh
I mean mostly of my friends who have tunang
siapa boleh kasi aku attention wise
aku faham aku faham tapi kaucara kau cakap is like
because it's very different it's very different bila kau tengok eh everything it's all scripted what
that's why it relieves your stress level bila kau tengok cerita tu
cam kau get excited
so ada so ada voting punya ni lah
tak semua I watch bondi rescue
kau tau eh aku tengok that bondi rescue thirteen season it's to the point that aku cakap ngan mak aku nak jadi lifeguard
uh bondi rescue is like mm kau lifeguard so basically you just jaga this beach kau
no they are just on their job basis so basically this cameramen just come in just shooting their everyday punya
no but you know it's very how to say ah macam
macam dia puaskan hati kau tau yang bila diorang actually
inspire me ya something like that because aku tengok kan this one season kan they diorang fail to apa tu uh save this couple tau old couple
they are in their seventies kalau tak salah aku they only managed to save
dia ada tiga orang this couple dengan lagi satu diorang punya kirakan in-laws lah
kirakan adik ipar is it aku pun tak sure
ah betul lah abang ipar lah tu
melayu fail
so basically diorang bila diorang dah save this tiga orang kan no diorang save satu aje dahulu because lifeguards kat situ empat orang in duty
three of them just go there and save kalau ada orang drown lagi how
diorang nangis actually because they couldn't save
diorang rasa macam diorang salah diorang punya salah sebab tu kan
aku nangis because aku tengok diorang actually trying to revive that that couple back
really diorang really like went all out
betul ah
that's why they cry because they try so hard tapi they try to actually macam cover themself up ah because diorang tahu kan diorang being
tapi banyak orang like surrounding diorang macam like kind of like macam blaming them for not doing their job properly macam couldn't rescue them on time
kau imagine eh kerja kau as a lifeguard kau ada empat like only four of you and you expect them to rescue all of you who are drowing which is to me pada aku is just so sad
oh kesian kan
kan that's why aku I wanted to be at that one point of time ah because aku really aku admire diorang punya how to say ah macam diorang punya semangat untuk kerja
kau tahu eh after that that three lifeguard eh two lifeguard took a long leave because they were was ah because they were affected by that thingy
abeh ada satu lagi that one episode before diorang habis tu season
yang satu budak ni actually dia carik bapa dia tau for three hours kat beach tu beach tu memang besar gila ah
dia ada north south
ah K basically K you get the point lah eh dia punya laut besar
dia cari bapa dia tiga jam pastu last dia pergi that tower where all the lifeguard is there dia cakap uh apa aku tengah cari bapa aku boleh tak buat announcement
yang kau tahu yang this one lifeguard actually cakap yang tadi aku try save this one old lady
aku try to save this one guy but then by the time aku sampai kepala dia dah takde
ya he wasn't sure at all itu orang ke batu
tak save because dia tak tak boleh cari
because diorang save is pakai board tau
pakai diorang diorang sendiri swim
surfing surfing board tu diorang sendiri pergi
K lah after that bila budak tu patah balik eh diorang punya mindset is all the lifeguard kalau selagi takde datang kat sini cari orang kirakan itu is batu bukan orang it's a good thing
dia tak move then after that bila budak tu datang dia cakap aku dah cari bapa aku dah tiga jam
semua orang got called out because they had to do a search in that laut
they they went there for holiday but then it ended up and the saddest thing is kau tahu on that day he died it was his birthday
aku nangis aku seriously mak dia dah pengsan anak dia dah kirakan nak jadi the strong pillar for the mother
he just stand there ah just wait for someone to actually bawak body dia masuk
aku emotional lah
itu dah lama seh
eh but diorang punya joke is very far how to say eh it's very
kau nak kene really like tangkap that to to actually understand
it's kelakar pada aku kelakar gila no okay dia punya joke is very
kau nak kene really understand
what if you watch properly you will understand that diorang punya joke is really mendalam
cam it's just inside joke
kalau if you get it you laugh if you don't get it you dont laugh you know that kind of shit
pada aku lah it's fun lah
aku kecik-kecik aku takde dreams seh

tapi diorang main-main jer kan
kau serious ah you are the oldest
betul tu I fully agree I fully agree ya I pun tengok the changi airport ada banyak benda nak buat eh I heard ah dekat changi airport ada this changi village kan ada what this ah steamboat or barbecue thingy what's the name of the restaurant I can't really ingat ah
oh ya that that's amazing that's amazing okay ah I don't mind go tonight I ask adam ah whether he wants to go or not so I mean I I think adam tengah dia mengidam want to eat beef there got beef ke tak ah
ah andes andes andes kat sebelah jer kan
oh okay lah I tak tahu I I think sedap mania would be good ah some more it's like you know the barbecue smell the charcoal kind of smell you know then balik semua bau baju bau gitu someone so
so oh ah ya lah ya lah but lepas tu ya maybe after kita dah makan duduk sana and then we can go over to changi airport can cycle look at what touristic mile thingy will be quite cool quite cool ya
then apa tu siapa lagi ah might follow ah
no he had nothing I pun tak tahu lah why he so tired
ah ya lah I mean kalau kita tak jadi pergi malam ni then maybe we can think about like going maybe like the seletar cafe or something
oh ya actually kan kalau kita car lite to there will it be expensive or cheap ah
oh ya true true sinopec ya very cheap but one thing ah I pump minyak by sinopec minyak ni macam
cepat habis ah minyaknya like tak concentrated you know so I'm like what's happening here ah
a'ah lah agaknya ah letak air
ah yang your your buku you borrow you start reading already or not
I think ada punya cari eatigo eh let me tengok eatigo pun okay juga eh kita boleh rasa makanan dia like like
harga dia pun err ah berpatutan betul betul
um okay by the way I baru check eatigo ah hari ini memang ada lima puluh percent so err selain dining in the garden ada apa lagi eh
tak I will I will think changi village will be a good idea lah tapi adam tak nak pergi ah adam ya
nanti I kena pujuk lah I punya adik untuk nak pergi kedai changi village cause I pun macam nak rasa makan barbecue barbecue but somehow I pergi sana akan makan cheese tofu sahaja so
eh lapar ah
ya kejap I tanya adam adam you nak pergi ke tak
adam dia cakap dia tak nak
I pun tak tahu ah adam cakap dia nak jinjja
dekat mana eh dekat
ah jewel boleh juga kat jewel
dia boleh tengok tengok aeroplane juga dekat jewel
I rasa tak
a'ah eh dekat hub ada kan
oh betul tu
it's like how to say ah it's like macam jinjja chicken oh oh no no it's like uh wing stop wing zone that one
okay lah ya I mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy macam chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap sia
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like macam you go to jinjja chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or ah it's that one lah macam gitu but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like macam got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone lah got a lot of different flavour ah like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
maybe that that's an option but I will still rather sedap mania ah sedap mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right kalau colour hijau then this price kalau
kuning the other price right colour hijau do you remember because colour hijau is the cheapest mah right so what kinds of foods do they have in the ya green plates do you do you remember
oh sounds yummy ya okay apa
ah it will be nice right I went to the website just now then I saw they got a satay soup base laksa soup base I'm like wah confirm sedap ah macam gitu
baik satay sauce soup base ya ya I think it's a new flavour maybe
tapi I tengah diet
tapi takpe lah hari ini dimaafkan lah
cheat day yes betul tu cheat day
macam mana I tak tahu kejap I tanya adik I adam
adik I mata tutup ah tiba-tiba
apa B B nine
err bukan bukan bukan
ya bukan
so okay kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni eh mari kita
ah nak cakap pasal orang tak
tak senonoh gitu eh
orang kasih assignment kita mengumpat
okay okay ya alright kita jadi serious um apa kita nak berbual eh um
uh kita punya keluarga or okay no lah no lah ah shares lah stock market lah eh
so um you ada any investment you you dah buat ke or anything you nak recommend
but I tak tahu because sekarang nak beli tesla mahal tak mampu though
I think kalau I I will beli the stock uh for what I have now lah my capital yang ada I would probably invest in cheaper stocks lah singapore based stocks like
uh old chang kee for example err murah jer you tahu tak old chang kee dia punya share price is err enam puluh satu sen saje tau ah serious a'ah betul tu then kalau you ada macam seratus ke dua ratus dollar then you akan
berbaloi lah then I I I mean ah I was looking at their annual report then old chang kee kan
dia orang akan open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like macam the demand for asian foods are rising tapi supply tak banyak
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region kan then agaknya I would think lah it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like um they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend lah so I mean that's my thing lah cause sekarang I don't think I I boleh mampu lah tesla mahal saje
ya tapi itu my thing lah on stocks
tapi masalahnya some some stocks dia orang tak how to say dia orang tak syariah on client tau so nanti dia orang tak
tak boleh lah kita tak boleh ambil dia punya um benefits lah from that stocks so ya I don't know lah I tak tahu lah ni semua islamic financial ah you tahu tak anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it lah that time I went for this uh website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get syariah pampasan or not
so it's very interesting because macam they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's uh allowed or not haram or halal lah in that sense tapi the problem with that website ah they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you kena bayar
then I'm like alamak then you muslim pun nak buat duit
nak tengok stocks halal ke tak
but I would say it's good lah like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very macam you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay lah that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
ya I think bagus lah kita sekarang err I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive lah
so ya bagus bagus bagus
you rasa
you rasa
good tak stocks
ya anyway err betul tu ya but I heard kan itu kalau you nak pakai wahed invest then
ada some fees involved right like apa tu
um okay apa eh nak bilang you oh ya anyway I I found out there is days
technically grow your money but with very low return lah so macam kalau you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you tak nak letak it in the bank lah
because firstly kalau you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the hibah tak banyak
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new saham returns tapi tak banyak the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like uh macam it's like a savings account with a little bit more uh
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
wasted lah I think like a lot of people macam lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are tak halal
ya lah wasted kalau dia orang tak invest in bonds then kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam seh if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
can lah nanti I call dia orang
ya lah I call lah I call lah I bilang lah kenapa ni right
for the idea of islamic finance because technically um you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also macam in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore macam not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
interest yielding accounts and maybe dia orang tak tahu lah it's haram because you would need to kind of know mah yang kita tak boleh yang interest and all bonds are tak halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya kita terus deep eh berbual
ya ya ya betul betul betul I was looking at um the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting lah because uh one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are err they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
SOCOE will be a good tapi I pun macam tak faham sangat lah how how the SOCOE um investment works but halal kan dia kan so boleh lah eh
oh kita punya trip eh ah I tak tahu lah I I punya adik kejap eh I call my adik hello
adik I baru kentut adik I kentut adik I lepas ni nak kena
I tak tahu dia punya ada like a mix of a and I don't know dia makan apa tapi bau dia like one kind you know toxic toxic
kentut ah I think maybe yes lah dia nak eating lah agaknya rasa gitu ah
ya ya itu I I I tu tak okay ha ha so anyway um
nak pergi makan I pun lapar sekarang belum makan so I pun nak pergi makan actually kan is hafizah going or not to sedap mania like what what do you think the chances are
mm mm ya lor actually semua pun dah agree apa sunday semua okay
aiyo unless kita just go somewhere to like makan lor
then after that we just lepak then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like lepak and makan lor
I would think maybe seletar cafe will be good tapi sana makanan dia tak halal so mana kita boleh makan oh maybe we can eat at seletar airport the mister teh tarik express dia tu mahal ke
I tak tahu what are good things for us to makan eh err
okay lah nanti I berbual dengan I punya adik lah mana kita nak pergi
but ya lah kita try lah I I pun lapar eh I I want to eat sedap mania
ah tengok ubin also
eh I didn't know tau ubin ada macam malay punya makcik jual I just recently found out I'm like what
ya lah okay tak nanti I kena banyak pujuk adik I lah
betul betul tu eh oh ya by the way just now I was looking at sedap mania punya website then uh
they have a lunch promo I think it's seven dollars or eight dollars and eighty or like macam let's say chicken set then you get your own in individual soup base then you get your own
sayur-sayuran condiments lah then you boleh like you know it's your own personalised then it's like eight dollar eighty cents tapi dia punya timing it's only from eleven thirty to two thirty so it's like actually during the lunch hours
ya ya kita dah missed confirm lah
ya besok lah I I okay juga kalau esok besok I think besok confirm tak ramai orang eh kalau pergi lunch lagi confirm kosong habis
it actually it sounds like a plan you know let me see ah besok monday I think I got nothing on
kita terus pergi ubin I boleh tapi perempuan I don't think dia orang pergi sebab besok christina I think dia kena exam so I think she cannot then hafizah dia nak ke
boleh juga kita cycle ke ubin
oh what's new ah like or rather what because december semua holidays we should like explore more places
marsiling tanya lah
car lite I think is err I think kalau the most expensive one right is err four dollars per four or six dollars per fifteen minutes
tak jadi lah gini
actually one hour eight dollar blue oh tak lah blue blue lagi mahal lah
I haus so ini air mineral water eh
eh a'ah lah kita minum air sama
oh tak lah ini kecil punya meadows
ya ya ya ya correct imagine dia orang tak
tak catch the fizz thingy then they just let people drink then they just let people drink wah
like err what's that word aniaya
eh takde lah sampai gitu
apa lagi kita boleh berbual pasal pasal entah lah
ah macam nak baca buku berbual buku tapi
tak boleh kan
biscoff itu tak boleh dah
ah ya sekarang I see biscoff dekat out of stock kat lazada out of stock
semalam I pergi cold storage ada stock so baru beli lah ya
makan lah sedap tu I buat cake pakai biscoff
coconut oil I I tak jual I beli pasal itu for rambut bagus sama rambut I sekarang macam berang kan so bagus ah bagus moisturising
alamak apa jadi
gini lah I sekarang
nak find ideas lah want to like the social mission
tapi I pun tak tahu so in singapore apa social mission you can solve
mana boon keng is it
at this block block block sebelas eh
ada yang sebelah main road tu yang you pass by satu block macam horizontal
ah block block tu I dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak eh block tu ada dadah semua I heard a lot of stories you know about the block
oh distant eh jauh lah tu
nama dia Q
ya so macam mana you tahu ni Q tinggal kat boon keng
I see I see ya I mean is is it because dia tinggal kat boon keng takde bapa ke tinggal boon keng pasal takde bapa
I I curious lah macam you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
oh dengan datuk dia
contohnya apa khabar eh are you close with the datuk
mak dia doctor apa though
like wah so I mean not bad eh walaupun dia tinggal at risk block mak dia doctor
kencang seh then kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak take her out you know
ah psychology you pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
bagus bagus bagus very good
I actually now you speaking of which ah I think I met someone like this you know tak tahu orang sama ke this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the boon keng area then there was this doctor dan dia punya kucing
so I was like tapi dia tengah pakai white coat lah eh doctor dengan kucing
ah a'ah lah agaknya vet I mean we don't know lah pasal career banyak
but I mean okay lah so maknya consider good lah doctor
good lah tapi anaknya
um I tak tahu I heard anak dia
ah I don't know how I heard lah where I heard lah agaknya kat mothership anak dia macam
apa seorang ah sampai or rather act a bit pelik you know
maybe dia punya anak needs treatment lah like like do you think so
a'ah lah agaknya lah however tak tahu
ya ya ya betul tu maybe what we can do is we can actually find this um Q your distant relative we can ajak her lah go makan oh maybe sedap mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
duit so
lagi more reason lah takde lah takde lah
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true lah if someone is put in that environment they kind of macam angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you takde you know outlet boleh keluarkan the perasaan
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally lah eh macam mana her eh I tau eat him or her up like internally
mm ah kenapa ni
um sentosa I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump itu I tak berani
tramp punya trail then we just macam
you cannot claim compensation lah because it's at your own risk mah you masuk tempat gitu so
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good lah cause kalau kalau tak then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
can also then luge macam laju lah a bit too fast don't you think so
morning will be best tapi
we can go malam lah or we can go like in the evening macam cold kan begitu so macam sunset
dia tak panas sangat and ya
not pergi maghrib I mean
mm okay okay then then good lah I would think of saturday banyak orang but it should be fine lah should be fine lah
I I sekarang tengah tengok harga per the hit rock mahal juga
ya ya that that's the lowest yang ada but other one is seven rides seventy five dollars and one ride is only five minutes yo
a'ah lah laju sangat ah
wait ah let me see ah apa lagi kita boleh buat dekat sana because it's only participating attractions so uh
eh I heard dia banyak burung uh okay anyway I tengok hit rock actually ada boleh lah err
blue zone one ride is fifteen token so boleh lah mampu kalau you nak two rides from green orange or blue zone
oh okay oh okay sea aquarium pun the token so boleh mampu
boleh juga then a bit boring actually boleh lah because ten token saje apa bukan ke tiga puluh apa
tapi I tak tahu boleh combine ke tak because it's their giant swing
bukan I think is bungee jump I don't know it's just says giant swing plus skyride plus ice cream fifty five token
tapi I takut lah I don't think I I can lah
eh ni macam interesting juga eh
ya naik segway
let me see eh kayak eh takde lah
takde kayak
actually we can take cable car I I pun tak pernah naik so if you want we can take the sentosa one just three dollars mah
ya ya ya so we can do that lah so it sounds like a plan ya I think it it or if you want sentosa island bus tour ten token I mean macam lame lah
mega bounce ten ten token two mega two mega zip sixty five token kira mahal lah mega jump fifteen token
actually kalau nak boleh juga kita boleh ten token lah untuk segway
then lagi the other ten token kita naik this
eh boleh lah you jangan kita kita tak buat banyak banyak benda lah
okay lah adam adam pun nak kan pergi so I ajak my adik also everyone lah this saturday go ramai-ramai
then actually kalau nak kita boleh beli the twelve piece chicken just now I was telling you about the shake shack duck that one
ya so we can buy that one so at the same time we can bring over loaf of bread untuk makan sandwich ke apa
err let me think maybe dekat maple city ah dekat and it's halal so shake shack in a duck
ya betul tu err they have one in great world city
I am sure a bit out of the way ah um unless we can nak kalau nak kita boleh beli dekat ang mo kio hub eh
lapan ada eh eh lapan ada lah ada jer tau kalau kat north kan
a'ah geram I wah not bad eh eh but I don't know whether the promo masih ada tak kalau
twelve dollars I'm not too sure tapi worth it seh twelve dollars
uh I'm not sure about the harga biasa but I think it will be much more than that lah definitely much more than that but actual price I am not too sure actually I pun tak pernah makan I just saw this on the telegram group

oh dia bukan segway dia bipedal bicycle for one hour
kalau you nak segway fun ride for five hundred meters it's fifteen token
tersalah so lah so the ten token right is for a bipedal bicycle
I I I tak tahu I I would think so
ya depan belakang kan
ya lah kalau begitu kena if you want to take the segway kan the segway eh mana ada
segway is fifteen token tapi five hundred meter saja lah half a
kalau you nak kita boleh pergi ifly
tapi dia punya token hundred and ten
eh okay token dia sixty token kalau you want one skydive
okay lah I mean okay so I think kita kalau nak we can go mega adventure park we can do one mega bound
macam tu lah would be best if we can like have a lot of like different different kind lah activities
ten token for one ride so kalau you nak we can do err one which is like five minutes confirm tak cukup tapi okay lah one one of ride and the other one is err the mega bounce mega zip so ten plus ten

ya lah
ya lah
ya ya I know satu cousin aku punya eh cousin aku kawan aku punya cousin
everytime time puasa
she will go back to the husband punya village then sekali
nanti time sahur
dia cakap there dekat tempat village tu banyak rumah kosong pasal kena sihir
a'ah kan and dia orang punya sihir is like sihir sampai mati punya
then ah nanti time sahur jer nanti dia cakap you will hear she will hear a lot of things macam budak nangis lah perempuan nangis lah kan then I was like thinking
bulan puasa seh
mm so moral of the story is don't marry a turkish man gitu eh
tak ah tak sangat ah
ah serious yang mana
ada ke seh anak buat mak gila
itu dabbe lah
ya it's not the mak buat
no mak dia kahwin kira dia dua ni mak dia dua ni dia orang bukan adik-beradik tau dia orang adik tiri
ya that but they don't know that dia orang adik tiri
ah it's not that the girl yang buat it's not the kakak yang buat tau
is it not the mak yang buat dulu ke
no mak dia yang buat dulu then terus dia punya hantu dengan jin tu pergi dekat kakak dia
yang dia nya yang dia nya best friend ada affair dengan dia punya husband kan
husband dia bunuh perempuan tu because of one gambar a'ah
but husband dia padan muka lah ya
siapa suruh cheat cheat on the best friend pula tu
she seek another doctor nya help tu kan dengan tukang ubat
but then kan kau ingat yang dia pergi yang dia punya yang dia pergi dekat tempat tukang ubat tu ke yang tempat doktor tu then ada satu budak perempuan tu yang boleh nampak-nampak barang kan dia cakap yang mulut dia kena paku kena begitu like what she did to herself
ya lah because they think macam why would a
jahat person come to seek for help
ya lah ya lah
ya lah but it's already written in the quran yang kau yang there's another world ya
eh tadi aku nak tanya apa eh
oh nanti dapat dia punya hundred dollars nya tu then they cannot stack the
pasal it's not like hundred dollars dia orang just hundred dollars again tau like it's break it's break it's broken into like maybe twenty dollars aku rasa
they say macam ada satu tempat tu yang dia punya fish and chips ke burger dia sedap
bedek eh
mak dia penakut ah
I don't know I've never ride the mummy before masa tu aku rasa
was either long queue atau tengah
then that time aku naik yang jurassic park kan basah kan after that kau tahu aku pergi mana yang tea cup nya
because I dekat tepi-tepi kadang-kadang ada dekat tepi-tepi there was this one yang dekat tempat tak ingat lah dekat tempat mana but it was it disguised itself himself herself as christmas tree habis aku kan
habis aku kan
buat christmas tree kan dulu
so aku pergi dekat aku macam aku nak pegang-pegang sekali tiba-tiba benda tu move tu aku terkejut
tak sis mak kau
because it managed to macam scare aku ah tu aku macam
ya he was laughing pasal macam aku kan susah nak takutkan a'ah then tiba-tiba dia macam macam itu
sixty something sama lah aku rasa
but one of the scariest is aku punya kawan ya tak pun yang the kak pon clan and she also looked like kak pon ah that one
my friend I said my friend is one of the scariest she also looked like kak pon
a'ah she is one of the ni lah kira kak pon punya scarers lah but she never entah lah dia tak cakap apa-apa pun
kan I wanted to go seh because aku rasa
yang hari tu aku pergi pun the the year before aku pergi the only thing that scared me was the
sabah dia orang macam buat sabah punya voodoo shit begitu
ya lah
dia no dia macam ah aborigine punya ni ah orang that apa tu
what is that called orang asli orang asli
it's not really macam scary
aku suka eh benda begini
sikit hari aku macam aku tengok yang puaka tu kan and then they were like saying yang sis huzairi ni ada cerita pasal kawan dia nak cerita cerita-cerita hantu ni semua then suddenly dia punya kawan just kept quiet and then just say like I will tell you next time macam
lain hari ah then ah then they were like macam apa seh engkau tiba-tiba ah then sekali I think he texted or cakap ah the next time err or like call or something aku pun tak ingat
mmhmm dia dekat situ then dia cakap ah eh dia balik ah then after that ah baru dia cakap ah tadi kita tengah cerita-cerita pasal tu banyak orang kan
habis ah then they say lah macam kadang-kadang kalau kita cerita-cerita benda begini macam benda macam it's like inviting the the thing then I'm like
there's no such thing as ghosts what there's only jin
I don't know ah because like macam hari tu aku tengok yang incredible tales tu kan they say their ah kong is there because they never burn the house
you know like chinese believe that they need to burn things like hell notes then a'ah for the departed then they just macam dia orang tak burn the house for him so he cannot he got nowhere to go because dekat tempat dia tak ada rumah so he went back to the house
okay but I got this one question for you habis kalau if you are poor what even can you do
it's not the worst sin lah but they believe that macam
ya lah but kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun it's not it's not a
you want to bunuh people with what seh I don't know you have don't have anything what
ya but at the point of time it's not kira dia macam you are not of sound mind tau at the point of time
ya but then that's the only kira macam that's the only sin lah kan
betul lah that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
tak juga no I mean like islam is fair because macam dia orang akan
akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau and then after that if you have your buruk and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your buruk but then after that you will be given a chance to
taubat lah that's why got
I asked this question during umrah
ya lah then that's why I say that's why that time I was in umrah then they they was talking about this lah like ah before we went to umrah we have like the course kan habis dia orang tanya lah macam okay then bila kita zaman ah this ustaz macam rock rock sikit lah habis dia cakap then bila kita zaman time zaman rock kita pun terlepas solat then dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat lah solat taubat then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back macam qada because you know you don't know how many
how would I know siapa kita nak judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga just because dia kasi air dekat anjing tu so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to pertikaikan kita punya amalan
kalau aku pun aku bunuh sia aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa
but he already bunuh the ustaz
ya lah that's why kan aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting sis kan aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki ah tapi dah maki lah tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda word this word is for another word but actually kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu
mm maki jer
that's why macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah plus point dah malaikat dah tulis dah oh dia nak solat ah dia terus nak pergi tak oh tak dia tak pergi tapi tak minus tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya ya then if kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak oh nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai lah orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu and dia buat jahat then baru dia orang tulis
it makes it macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam because
like orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya sister sister nak sembahyang pun sister nak solat kita buat jer yang wajib
doesn't mean like you don't wear your tudung your amalan is lesser than
yang spaghetti bolognese punya hook tu aku cakap apa tu yang
lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that aku ni ah aku ni perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people lah
oh sis lagi kena teruk everytime I wear tudung then people all like macam cakap aku ni macam-macam
it's not about step good good ah dia macam macam ah alah perempuan tudung ni semua you know the guys that I like get to know right they say macam perempuan tudung ni
actually senang jer
macam kira senang dapat ah
it doesn't matter lah I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just apa kita
like I think those kind of things so so macam
mengghairahkan and
siapa nurul
the cantik one
she what her display picture ah yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab
no I mean like macam you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
tak ah sis more aware ah
but how to makan ah with niqab so you just open like that then makan I mean like ya ya lah
ya but then macam that's how people see you as a hijabi ah so when kau macam jatuhkan judgement dekat niqabi when orang jatuhkan judgement as
dekat kau as a hijabi then kau macam tak boleh terima
but actually macam betul lah cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
ilmu lah kenapa kau nak pakai niqab so engkau punya journey
so macam kau punya journey tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu
dia macam there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
tapi macam okay speaking of this eh I was like thinking tau masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam very ah small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and dia orang punya tulang is very small so like
not say macam fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then macam bila aku pakai eh aku rasa macam then I was saying this to nek yam you know then I was like macam eh habis nanti orang pakai habis macam
you know all these people macam pakai macam terletak jer then macam for me is like terletak and then tiba-tiba macam shoulder besar
and shoulder besar and then like then macam tergantung ah macam tergantung kita macam hanger so it's like it's not nice ah pada aku then after that nek yam said something that macam terus macam aku terus ugh
macam then she say you wear things you want to wear a niqab you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of allah
sis terus shut up lah
ya lah but doesn't mean kau presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just macam kau tak boleh change diri engkau
dapat sis looking at her
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time macam she became a basic
but then macam but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly ringarde lah
in dunia lah mmhmm
tapi macam kalau kau dah actually kau pakai hijab jer kau dah kena sacrifice all these things seh slowly lah
dia macam ah there's one application that I tried is ah mystery shopper
so then they pay you upfront ke or they
that means doing the pharmacy punya side lah but the problem is I have to
I can only work until december but then dia orang cakap cannot they have to I have to commit at least one year
wasted right and then the uh apa ni we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
mm tapi dekat jems kau
ya I can actually kerja dekat uh sana kan if they can ini but then too bad
that's why then another one I tried is uh apa ni
but that one is uh apa ni that one pun uh ada shift ah seven to
even uh temperature taking also they ask you to apa ni they will ask you to commit for at least
tapi dormitories is very risky because
no because sometimes it's up to the apa tu management to
tapi nanti dia last minute there's always a lot of changes and the changes are always come
say one week before lah macam like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
what day I'm working so hopefully tak ada change
tapi kalau ada change then susah lah how am I going to call the ini kan the other job
correct that's why I think my colleague kan dia tak nak she doesn't want to do this uh macam because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
ya she requested for a full time tapi bagus kau dia punya because of
actually they are looking for a cashier cum store assistant take stock all these ah tapi because of dia punya qualification and maybe also because she want to do full time right
ya I mean it's good for her also anyway she's dia dia pun I think on work pass eh
mm because we cannot my current employer dia cakap if let's say you're on work pass because a few of them were asking can they
so they are asking if they can go back to their country and then still work as per normal lah but so just log in apa
it will I think there's some law thingy ah and then kesian kan all these uh
passes holder like because what they are thinking is dia orang nak save on rental
ah then down there tak ada imagine one person rent one room like five six hundred and then now your pay is like half
kesian seh
because dia cakap that time kan ah during the COVID period then all these malaysian tak boleh balik
the father passed away a few years back lah so he staying the whole house alone and then dia cakap ah he advertise on gumtree um
apa ni dia cakap ada all these during this period whereby the malaysian cannot go back
with aircon and with uh that's it tak keluar pun and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
whereas si azman ni pula uh dia kerja
and then at night he say he have the house to all to himself tak kecoh-kecoh you know
ya and then anyway they come back also just to sleep so I ask him then cooking how dia cakap cooking because all male
uh I think five room also ah dekat woodlands
tu dia cakap uh because his pay was uh cut I think about thirty percent eh thirty
thirty percent ke forty percent so the rental income that he got makes up for the pay that he kena cut
but I guess it's okay lah because he's a guy abeh dia pun macam tak keluar bilik unlike macam perempuan kan suka keluar
but cool right I mean like you don't really have to struggle lah macam ada job ada job tak ada job tak ada job anyway I have extra income
tak boleh order tak boleh keluar makan I mean like once in a while
so that's why then what about your side your company okay tak
those who are urgently need to balik kampung or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
are mostly macam like attracting you you know and then like you say maybe is just to collect data so once the
lepas tu bila kau dah kasih kau punya resume apa semua then they will say okay we will call you once there's any opening
ya I guess tapi ten K eh
she said she rented one condo dekat uh harbourfront down there per month is five K you know
tapi bila sometimes ah when it comes to their private travel ah wah then the the wife can be bossy
that's why sometimes I hear complain from ah macam
ah I also got one experience because apa ni dia punya secretary punya boss the boss is a very nice guy you know
and then ah uh every year they have this uh macam trip home trip lah so call home leave
as long as the amount don't exceed if exceed the amount then of course they have to top-up themselves um so if they don't use and then just rugi lah it's like forfeited
then lepas tu kan nanti along the way there will be changes of course
uh apa ni kenapa deduct eh I think about two two hundred thousand or something like that it's a lot you know it's a lot of amount
so dia cakap uh did he upgrade or any he asked me to check dia kata bila krisflyer actually deduct salah or what
nothing we don't do anything with krisflyer or anything uh we didn't do any claim lah check punya check rupanya wife dia
aku tanya dia uh apa ni so the
ya funny right can you imagine he sekali ah he keep keep keep the point to do something or to bring the family out or what sekali ah the
dia punya wife claim everything siao
ah every time like that nanti karang uh apa tu you I I purposely want to travel with this airline because I
I got this card and then I want to claim mileage here I want to macam-macam lah
ya because the fare pun if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
but if let's say you take the highest one the one that uh got no rule ah macam
yes lepas tu the company is telling us to save cost
so of course we have to choose the lowest right and then when it comes to changes dia bising
susah seh but you never know what sometimes ah last minute changes or last minute nak kena pergi sana pergi sini
but some of the traveller I will tell them I say no no no your boss better don't ini
remember that time yang kau punya si ex
terbalik right
aiya for actually for them ah definitely they want to they will apa ni push push to somebody what
book lepas tu tak check and then just give
baru dia cakap don't don't repeat the same mistake
ni apa flight actually you take
no I think it's expensive pasal ah it's either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
actually ho chin minh ada banyak flight apa vietnam air I think at least got three or four flight
other than that ada budget airlines
of course it's not funny lah you crazy macam I can imagine you don't have anything down there and then here he call you and you are laughing away
tak messy sangat pasal kan if you were to do like that ah macam like
macam departure for saturday I do then departure for monday you do both hotel and flight
so it's by by departure date tau dia bukan macam
you know if you have always if you have a group of people travelling ah it's very messy so you have to see macam
aku cuma ambil yang departure on the saturday
tak pasal the different website got different allotment why sometimes ah like macam ah agoda they got ten ten room
so that's why if you go agoda all the ten rooms are booked tapi bila you go to booking dot com maybe they are still five rooms available
tapi actually if you want to play safe right for for this type of group or what you should just contact the hotel directly
tapi okay ah because okay lah macam let's say it's individual booking
I'm sure they have their own bilik tau
nanti they will expect they will know that there's a group booking they are expecting you tak from this company this company ah so it's easier
I think it's china hong kong tak payah visa
tapi kalau china visa ah
ah apa tu passport I think it's about three hundred dollars
ah you can still it depends ah tapi
kalau if they are travelling around asia pac ah you definitely have to check they will definitely need business visa
cuma kalau dia declare as tourists then they don't need
tapi tourist also you don't declare as tourist then you wear your jacket smart smart tie all go of course they don't believe you lah
but luckily tak payah I mean they don't have to is a paper visa you don't have to stamp it on the passport
aku rasa kalau tu baru lagi dia jump
it's just the you know dia punya screw dia terpleot
I mean don't judge a book by it's cover tapi
the company is like neither here nor there kalau kau apply for a job and let's say you get a job
susah lah
well maybe if you see that probably all the linkedin punya tu is under recruitment agency no harm just go lah anyway they just want to collect data what
first of all I want to know right shu tu siapa
eh shura kau nak pergi kau nak err interview abang ah abang aku abang aku awesome tahu kau tahu tak
eh shura kalau kau nak kan kau boleh err interview abang aku ah because abang aku kan

so macam uh I I'm kind of disappointed lah that
it's always guy on guy it's guy macam there's a recent rise right on guy on guy crime
so macam it it it kind of pisses me off ah
hostel punya the hostel environment ah
ya most of the incidents happen at hostel punya area do you know that do you know that
I really really needed to take to take a piss nak cepat-cepat kencing and it really cannot tahan punya
we wanted to use the complex punya toilet right but there was so many people

abang kosh
the sister is dee kosh punya sister
what are influencers influencers buat apa
so am I right to say right am I right to say eh ted bundy pun influencer
ted bundy pun influencer
tapi lifestyle dia orang tapi lifestyle dia orang gerek pe
like more than a hundred thousand subs lah not not that I do or I care lah but macam sekarang
talking to them talking to them very talking about them very poorly lah macam
kau ambil kesempatan kan untuk bual
untuk bual dengan mengumpat orang mengumpat pasal orang then
kau mengumpat mengumpat mengumpat then
you know that you you didn't prepare contingency plan lah furthermore also macam everybody
tapi kau kau pandai kau pandai sangat kan
this kind of content eh the macam
gossipping eh to me right is macam is very normal you know guys gossip
we're keeping it to ourselves whereas macam dee kosh eh he
macam I I actually I I more or less kind of hate most of the
now sekarang
err macam like still remember err the what's her what the fuck's her what the fuck's her name err
ah nicole choo with the ridhwan azman kan macam
actually if you when I think about it again eh when I when I really really think about it again ah macam actually the nicole choo right is not doing anything wrong you know
nicole nicole choo right nicole choo dengan ridhwan eh memang they memang dia orang buat
habis macam they have the drama and then people are not supposed to know about this drama you know but they
then dia orang punya pasal lah then dia orang punya pasal lah then you want to comment right fine lah you can comment you can fine lah you can go ahead
at times right macam I feel that it's err
err from what I know lah macam he made a video like reviewing her reviewing her work
so macam then
look at how macam she got reviewed and all that I mean okay I
to me right to me eh the only wrong right they only wrong eh yang the you only wrong that
if in my very humble opinion lah the only wrong yang dia buat kan is
like my also eh also apasal budak-budak zaman sekarang kan you guys are so drawn right to simple stupid shit
okay is because you all budak-budak zaman sekarang right love nonsense eh like TikTok and
okay if that was the case right can you tell me ah agak-agak kan
what kind of orang kan is selalu buat benda macam ni
what type of what type of what type of orang
like the fact you right the fact is macam
male err like these YouTube celebrities right that's why or like ridhwan right because macam I don't see any of the things that they do right macam
applicable to my life useful in useful useful in my life right or macam I don't see them possessing any characteristics right which I as a man right can look up to and respect ah
although the err macam at fate
manlier than I'm manlier than they are then macam like
what skills that do that they possess what skills do they possess right macam
that's really macam
macam that's really important
but they are not really that funny and then look at their target demographic ah their their target demographic right is macam
is err those macam budak err those macam budak-budak belum sunat gitu

ya hor why so macam takut semacam aku pun macam very curious wasn't he the one who keep pushing kau to get your license so that kau boleh cepat-cepat drive tak menyusahkan dia and then tiba sekarang kau dah ada license tiba kau tak boleh pegang kereta
abeh azrul boleh ah
azrul selalu keluar I remember
ya dia fresh pass pun eh aku nampak ada P plate kat kereta dia
ya and last time kereta dia is family friendly meaning like young or old fits the person cause it's Fiat Fiat punto kan ya
technically I'm the last azlan still haven't get license nor will he ever get knowing knowing dia punya pace macam gitu
ambil ah license
surrounding dia punya vehicle
apa dia merepek eh
eh but kau kereta kau kereta pula motor kau lawa though
that's the one that aku nak
rental rental pun at least kalau dia keep paying if he can afford
that duke tu what or what
itu rental juga atau beli
motor apa seh
is that macam punya
kawan kak yin siapa sia
nadia punya is that one meh
apa racer
oh very dia lah very dengan kind macam gini eh
yes dia pun macam macam rumi juga a bit lah
it's just the pelik for me
I don't know ah dia macam
I think dia dah gonna get
engaged eh ke kahwin tak tahu lah cause dia I don't know aku selalu nampak dia on Instagram dengan this one indo girl
in the video I think I got hear before dia berbual indo macam indo punya kind
so that time dia dengan dorothy together
and then dia punya Instagram is still dia dengan perempuan tu
I don't know eh but dorothy punya Instagram is different dorothy dengan dia
so I don't know ah apa
what kind of three way ke apa binatang it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird pelik also
then that time yang aku pergi tengok thai punya performance kat monti
then kita invite rumi also lah cause rumi cakap dia nak tengok like um drag performance those nya kind
and then banyak-banyak then
tertiba dia macam tak ada girlfriend
dia dia cakap dia single cause
know thai punya friends those gay friends keep asking ah like apa tu oh ah where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what dorang macam nak menggatal kan then macam like
oh no lah I'm single and some more dia tengah in ke apa
but then dia punya Instagram masih ada the indo girl tu
and then just damn pelik ah sia and he host around with anything that moves
aku pun tak tahu aku just don't know lah
but I know zul tak comfortable dengan rumi also
zul pun petty nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap like I don't want to talk to rumi cause he never wish me happy birthday
macam apa kau merepek eh
ya apparently then aku macam
girl kalau aku lupa nak wish kau macam mana eh how ah and was like I probably won't talk to you ah
I tak faham
aku just tak faham I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday dia macam like dia cakap birthday is important what it's once a year what so hard
then aku cakap like if you're not
ah aku tak faham ah
but zul know I know zul um tak comfortable cause of tu ah
um rumi I think rumi macam menggatal dengan dia also
unfortunately for his case lah but I think that time zul was with dylan dengan mata air dia ah
ya and then dia cakap like rumi eh rumi uncomfortable and then macam
kalau I know we are all closed kita very touchy also cause we hug a lot ni semua then
dia cakap rumi rumi does that ah but rumi macam
it's kau
macam gitu jer ah
but rumi I've always seen as that way cause first time aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu
kita semua minum pe together at sticky fingers
but I like to see dia punya Instagram cause dia selalu pergi merayap makan and he eats good food
kat tempat the weirdest place
ya and dia ada motor I think
I think dia ada motor vespa
vespa dia macam ada shield macam that big ass shield kat depan
dia very gitu lah macam indie macam dia nak stand out from the rest
dia macam dia kind of mainstream but dia tak nak show yang dia mainstream so he gets something that is
macam kawan kau ni ah also macam motor tak banyak but actually people want that kind of bike
ya dia macam gitu jer
maybe ah the dorang just what one year apart kan
dorang sama batch pe so ya
cause dorang cousin
ya hor then that one yang mana muka dorang pun tak sama sangat
case dorang pakai baju
senonoh gitu ah quite presentable
but aku just stress ah
aku just stress tengok dorang
I think dorang tu lah
I think rumi ambil
culinary but I don't know if it's ke tak I think he went to SHATEC or some
cooking school cause aku nampak dia selalu masak jer
uh I don't think rumi take aku dulu ingat dia gemuk dia pernah tunjuk gambar dia
dia tunjuk gambar dia grow up ah that that night at sticky fingers ah dia macam like eh you all want to see or not I last time look like what gemuk gila gemuk gila macam bola sia muka dia
I think masih ada kat dia nya Instagram dia post
probably eh cannot be dia baru enlist baru juga enlist
kau tahu yang dia kambing boy kan
kau tahu advertisement yang kambing
no like I think Suria ada this advertisement where
anak kambing saya and then dorang pergi macam this farm abeh ada advertisement kambing lari-lari rumi was
rumi was that boy in the in the kambing video that's why when aku jumpa dia kan at times like eh
kau macam familiar then tahir first time aku dah tahu dulu cause dia cakap dia in that kambing video and then when I brought tahir out to meet justin zul rumi semua and then macam like
and then keep keep keep guessing then thought he really is the kambing boy but dia tak pernah post ah
tak pernah post at all kau tengok gemuk weh
then dulu dia masih gemuk sikit
he doesn't like pout or whatever shit oh dia ambil gambar nanti boleh nampak macam kalau aku nak ambil selfie atau aku ambil group photo nanti tiba-tiba macam like dia adjust adjust dulu angle dia baru dia stare through camera gitu
oh there kawan-kawan dia
I don't know many picture ambil budak whampoa ah sia
if I'm not wrong dia bukan melayu
but dia berbual melayu ah I think
dia ada malay blood but I don't think it's like full
it's smaller and smaller lagi-lagi kalau kau masuk kan tertiba semua orang kau kenal
macam aku ah aku before aku satu orang pun tak kenal sia aku cuma tahu aku punya secondary school friends and friends
then masuk you will be like eh kau kenal ni kau kenal tu oh aku dari dulu sekolah tu
kau masuk aku rasa kau will meet
cause kau ninety nine
so yang kau meet also is those like long route punya sekolah
lagi lama lah sia
poly itself is already three years kalau kau remote remote
no choice I think last boleh ambil kau twenty six twenty seven
twenty aku masuk twenty fourteen twenty fourteen
twenty fourteen atau twenty thirteen ya
then ada satu budak ni from nineteen ninety
so it's like what twenty four gitu and he's one of the oldest
aku rasa kau kau masuk nanti kau tua sia kau masuk next year kan
eh kau graduate is what month
april oh that means kau aku punya intake ah
should be masuk may atau june aku june intake what
girl aku that time tak ada choice
aku two weeks jer aku dapat surat tu aku dah kena masuk kena campak ah sia
aku nya applications for private schools jer dah rejected say oh we cannot accept you cause your letter is too soon and then cannot cannot apa tu reject aku nya school applications cause
it doesn't makes sense but aku aku tak faham but aku masuk anyway
if aku defer I have a feeling I would go into army
for sure cause abang aku not in recruit anymore what
that time I wanted to lah I die want to cause aku nak main combat combat nak main tembak-tembak semua cause
tak ada orang dapat main tembak apa unless you're in police lah but police punya
weapons weaponry and shit is different is more to apa tu defence atau macam whatever protection lah
duit aku sia
is it the one kat tempat yang yang
dekat dengan some centre thingy where all secondary school last time kena pergi kan
itu yang indoor kan
ya but yang outdoor pun ada pe budak-budak pergi
last time is the same venue just that ada macam this tempat lapang ni
padang or some some plain field lah I don't know I not I not
we'll see lah we'll see kalau kau masuk army ke tak okay
petition for apa eh
of course lah dia nak standardise dia nya family
no cause that time I did remember I had a talk with your mum kat tempat the car wash kat then macam like
oh baba lele is then macam aku and then pop is police then aku macam like okay what kalau adik masuk at least dia belajar real life skills kalau tak masuk paramedic pun at least ada firefighter cause ada dua jer pe yang
hot spot nya vocation then macam like tak nak ah mama nak dia masuk army that's it
sister aku dah macam gitu macam okay but ya lah I mean
for sure kau better off in
army lah cause kau dulu pe
aku rasa mama kau die die tak nak kau masuk police lah or just cause dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya son go through the
ah boys punya experience
ah brotherhood dia dia cakap yang oh tak ada brotherhood
macam what where my sisterhood
ada tu ada lah tapi macam you know nanti korang dah pergi station terus kau pecah like go scattered elsewhere
but ya kau masuk army sua
kau have one job okay kau jangan disappoint your mum
technically budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada choice pe apa benda before enlistment you can apa tu fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause dorang cakap banyak orang depression cakap yang dorang kena campak to different organisation and then dorang suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill punya shit
especially banyak orang complain sia aku tak faham aku that day pergi balik to my academy aku tengok
barang-barang kau semua dah siap sia atas katil
it's not like macam dorang bagi kau an empty bag then like my time I
bag bag besar tu then kena pergi two different store rooms cause aku kecil gila so aku kena cari aku punya size know campak kena ambil dorang dorang campak helmet
helmet dorang campak bottle dorang campak jer eh macam like
macam kau tahu aku tak tahu aku rasa dorang were paid to be that much of a an asshole
so dorang macam kat table dorang kan dorang macam like S size S size then budak-budak store dia macam like keluar kan barang abeh macam like campak campak kat pile lah so that pile is all S size another pile is so
kalau aku nak aku ambil from that pile yang dorang campak campak tu ah so aku just ambil jer
then dah tu apa
aku patah balik bunk kau tahu kita kena
apa tu apa dia cakap fall in eh
fall in kat tempat kita punya coy apa benda tu and then kita alpha so alpha tingkat dua jer tak payah nak naik like five six storeys but alpha alpha and bravo
um kita nya bunk is
single bed is not like double deck so I think charlie and delta delta paling worst ah obese kan so delta is the last floor plus dorang bunk bed ya so the entire macam kau tahu the spiral stairs
it's not an open stairs dia macam ada window ah but tutup so kadang-kadang bila dorang dah habis training dorang nak naik kan nanti dia punya tingkap all like foggy
cause dorang punya body sweat and heat kan naik atas and especially dorang kena sampai tingkat enam ke lima girl aku tengok dorang you know bau lah cause they have cause we have to share the stairs ada tiga so
so pandai pandai korang lah scatter kan but I don't know why dorang suka naik kat tangga where it's always alpha yang kena pakai alpha pakai cause alpha tingkat dua jer and then dorang naik itu
but anyway bila aku nampak aku kan nak tidur kan dorang macam kena brief debrief eh kau punya before kau boleh tidur kau kena drink up drink up aku is like
ya I think the bottle besar lah sia
I don't know how many ah I think one litre atau five hundred cannot be five hundred this is not much this is five hundred
so it's one litre ah tu so one litre kau tahu aku dah gini gini means half kan
so aku manage to drink half then aku tak boleh minum then aku
dorang tak boleh cheat what cause nanti at the end of the tu siapa dah habis kena gitu
tak boleh kena ada drip lah kat lantai tak boleh macam
tak boleh weh first day kita belum tukar into our uniform what it's civilian clothes
so basah then aku dah habis kan
kau tahu first day aku pegang bottle aku weak gila ah sia kan
sakit and I don't I'm not like uniform group trained
and is aku pun satu selenge lah dah isi bottle tu and then dia punya body of the bottle is basah dah basah habis slippery abeh aku terslip or is it jatuh aku nak kutip
member tendang ah sia botol aku gi kat longkang then aku macam
aku first first tengok dia like
and then macam like what where's your attitude gitu then macam like no instructor then aku macam then you wait for what dia maki berlambak ah then it's instead of but dia cakap

kau tahu aku tengok dia aku macam like no instructor terus aku macam
abeh aku nak buat apa sia sekarang bottle kan abeh dia suruh aku kutip bottle aku macam anjing sia then nak naik balik kan
aku tak habis ah minum air aku aku dah gitu nak muntah naik aku ingatkan boleh tidur bed sheet tak ada sia
dia lipat bed sheet letak kat atas meja suruh kita pasang sendiri
kita kena masuk kan bed sheet kita kena adjust kita punya benda tu semua
my god abeh sekarang aku tengok budak-budak semua dah bed sheet dah pasang and then ada nama dorang at which bed and then nama dorang I think macam apa know their body size lah so kalau macam dorang punya baju are all S then
all S dah kat dalam bag dorang so nicely the bottle is at the bottle compartment diary gutter semua then bila aku pergi tengok aku macam like the hell is this what the hell are they doing then then macam oh they only go for training and then aku tengok training dorang is light so light macam ringan nak mampus
so aku just tak tahu ah sia apa dorang buat
don't know most of them complain cause of homesick lah cause my time that time apa tu ada budak ni
and yet he bila book in kan dia selalu AWOL
bila dah jumpa dia the next week dia dah masuk kan nanti macam like oh dia cakap like oh my after all apparently dia punya family sick but then when the budak-budak provost the security pergi rumah dia

no saint patrick budak-budak thirsty kat situ budak-budak female thirsty not only female thirsty male thirsty also I can't
aku that time nak sia masuk saint
it's macam low-key prestigious for being an all guys slash all girls school cause sana dengan saint pe
a'ah merepek gila
but budak-budak saint is sampah
macam also
sampah sia dorang
ya but you're only limited to that time to jerit what
kau nak jerit kat orang buat apa eh
ya but why jerit during when can jerit everyday and not be in that also
dorang tu um scout me for
apa tu saint john
tak nak medical kan
buat apa ya
cause it's the biggest uh macam parade kan
cause I remember D&T block like really kecil and then in between the classes
no the centre one banyak pokok the the gardening the science block one is slightly bigger the space
situ jer korang merayau kat sana
but ya I I mean is the foot drill kan macam side side foot drill nya competition macam korang buat foot drill cause of footwork so korang buat the or whatever shit it is called is for precision
ee ada what what uniformed group ada eh
I know primary school ada scout
oh join kat luar
buang masa jer
east side tak ada eh
west coast ada cause that time I remember ada this budak book in
kau masih budak how can you
eighteen and I hold like like corporal how are you lieutenant then I realised aku zoom kan it's not civil defence
it's and then they go around macam
I think macam tu ah hannah nya ex siapa tu nama nya
siapa nama dia khai eh
ya and then dia dia nya mum
text hannah cakap like takmo jumpa anak dia selalu
tak cukup ke jumpa kat sekolah kau imagine kalau mak dia dah cakap gitu dekat faiz faiz would
kan terus ten K pun buang
merlin merlin semua camelot semua ada
wait but the one yang faiz bilang kan is the same night yang kita keluar
um cause when faiz bilang kan
oh wait my mum did say something about like faiz got something to tell the family I macam apa benda
how his mum gonna fork out ten K I mean you have to understand faiz is an only child habis tu dia nya parents also
work humbly lah like kerja enough for dia punya own small family he's not a richie boy a richie solo kid
and all his earnings are to his family and his his own allowances dia tak minta pun ibu dia duit that's for sure I know lah
so kalau dia minta a'ah minta aku two hundred
aku dah order apa dia cakap dia dah order tak ada duit nak bayar then aku macam
aku tak faham sia dia eh buat aku stress sia
lapar lah sia
kau imagine kalau aku abang aku dengan faiz are all girls mak aku minta ah confirm dorang tak nak kan bayar kan bodoh
oh ya yang tempat park avenue tu
not the melayu
I malay melayu
ah sia aku bagi dia eight eight jer lah
abang kau bagi fatin how much
but quite sepet mata dia weird eh was it dengan kau
ah dengan kau lah
kan aku keluar lift then aku cakap eh ni nak salam ke tak eh
then mak aku cakap itu kan bapa pengantin that's the one kan
oh ya ya he got the sepet eyes
damn kau ada kau ada new member
tiger dah accept
bodoh lah
apa sia tak ada duit nyayi
aku tak save pe duit
no I mean like there's a difference what between kau nya savings for your own self savings for
mm but he's holding the entire family punya
every month atau year annually got money lah store in so can take out once cause dia nak let go let go of all so that we all have our individual punya insurances investments and shit so he keep forcing me to be more independent so aku macam like apa ni I am still seventeen at heart but cannot lah
ya ya I think dia bilang
but we met what that time yang kat airport all all her sisters were there except for the youngest one
ya the yang kecil tak ada cause that time me and tahir didn't know that the youngest sister existed ya and then when dia tunjuk adik dia aku macam siapa ni this one my sister huh your older sister no this one my younger huh tahir pun macam like no cause we thought
all youngest cause tahir youngest aku youngest kau youngest so we thought she also youngest she don't give off the slightly older sister vibe
cause the mum tanya apa like ah this one can trust or not go overseas this one how old already twenty nine twenty three we are turning twenty two
cause we are what nineteen birthday kau dah lepas pe
ah kau nineteen lah twenty eighteen what
tahir nya birthday belum lagi apa so
september ya and then kita balik a few days later birthday dia
eleven cause that time you I got apa tu notified it's on my archive
it's too much already eh now banyak sia kawan aku dah post macam like
um much needed eh apa tu much misses holiday either bali lah patong beach lah all those
aku was there like
so mama you already you know right that kakak kan suka makan ayam goreng right and then lately kakak macam makan popeyes sebab I think popeyes punya ayam goreng is way nicer than what do you think
popeyes punya ayam is more crunchy eh I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to and then ya the mashed potato popeye punya like lebih sedap
and then compared to punya tak sedap langsung I mean like it's it's it's nice
lagi-lagi like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
but then you still have to wear your mask macam susah and then it's also tak fun langsung sebab
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people macam complain
dia susah to dapat the vouchers sebab ada berapa banyak website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website tu then in the process semua pun macam very sulit and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think kalau tak salah first of december
I don't know eh I think so like I saw at kita punya void deck they put the poster everything then they say um start date thirtieth this monday lah thirtieth november until like
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean kemas and then the after is yellow very dirty then macam macam asyik lunyai and everything so ya
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask tak boleh dipakai so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that dia punya paint very faint very thin macam acrylic dia it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with err like a bit more macam like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last mah so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very rugi because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag banyak all my stuff so ya I don't know see how lor even if I buy like um the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so tak tahu ah macam mana
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then kalau tak habis then I will be rushing then susah if I rush because
I think so ah that one also not so sure you have to check with the ustazah again
ya the water sports sounds fun ah but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so tak tahu macam mana
until june two thousand and twenty is kalau tak salah the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
um chop chop type of person ya you know so kena we all nak buat macam cepat-cepat because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then dapat rehat cepat so ya
I think you can ask adi if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got madrasah tomorrow
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog goreng or like fishball like that
the epok-epok also just now err orang sebelah kasih also like very nice also
but the epok-epok like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very garing
I think like the epok-epok when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old chang kee one cause it's like
err taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat sebab dia banyak inti and then dia pun macam dia pun macam very crunchy rangup like that
but it was like very little but got flavour lah and then macam very sedap macam rasa macam those ondeh-ondeh cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then macam very manis and everything then I cannot tahan also
the apam I ate and
oh then I don't know cause the apam was actually supposed to be one for me and one for adik but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if adik ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the bhatoora
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the apam
and then the the kuah from the bhatoora also still have
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to tuang it's on the bhatoora
doing hummus right tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan hummus
macam sedap seh
oh ya baklava also very nice baklava with like teh O sedap seh
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then bila dah nak makan then macam rasa dia berbeza cause orang lain yang buat
so ya macam tak tahu ah like
oh I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream macam tak
ya the whipped cream it's like macam it's not like serasi in that not not not serasi it's like tak equal like that bila dia spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
I think the satay when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the lemak and then you know the satay punya minyak ah like that right and then you eat with the lontong the bawang timun everything then you cecah in the kuah very sedap and then macam
ya the babat I thought the babat satay I wouldn't like but when I ate it bila masih panas kan sedap gila then macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan
I think the I don't know for me was the nasi was nothing special it was like nasi minyak like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice ah but the they have the like the sambal not the sambal but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli makan dengan green chilli gitu with the nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam crunchy crunchy gitu
but the daging very nice macam makan gitu macam sendiri because it's very easily peel off then macam very sedap
and then macam the minyak right I was thinking if like if kalau kat rumah sendiri right the nasi you put in the minyak then you panaskan you buang you buat macam nasi goreng like that
not a lot of flavour but like just the daging taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli makan tepi gitu
but the sad thing is the vegetables dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit jer the lettuce and everything ya
sebab if I have a lot then macam makan pun macam tak segan right then can put and wrap everything nicely
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then nasi then we still have a bit of the serunding right
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and serunding will taste nice so I think macam beli lettuce atau cabbage gitu kan serunding and then buat macam wrap wrap gitu then sambal belacan and then a bit of macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak
no eh I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so nak beli barang tu semua but maybe we all like
keluar keluar to cause hari ni is
uh naomi's birthday and then like we all thought macam
uh kita pun terlupa then it's like oh then we just okay lah december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
err kailey and ayumi the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like macam
to cause like dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya timetable semua very busy right so nak jumpa and then macam makan sama-sama or something then that time I told you me and ayumi we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right dia belanja because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what ah see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped kena find orang baru ah don't know how see first
bet the person bought lebih sedap daripada you beli because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then macam
tak was-was also nak makan
so ya then kalau you beli besar pun like knowing you you know like you makan one slice then you can simpan if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like lemak manis everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit lah because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one wah very nice I rugi they never buy the apple flavour
if not then go eat at hajjah maimunah or something sana kan sedap and then like
it's besar so dua orang makan kenyang
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like belanja her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like macam treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
minum teh like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you boleh makan kat situ macam tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where macam dia orang makan ah you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
uh my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the uh tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also dia minum macam sedap
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive lah but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan catch up with one another
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like buka the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think kalau tak salah it's
the desserts all like really nicely macam betul-betul sedap-sedap they got assortments macam like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain macam susah nak pakai voucher ni sebab you tak tahu really macam mana nak pakai you tak tahu hotel mana accept hotel mana tak
the ya then macam got a few cafes lah if not also the
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like bugis or something to lepak and berbual-berbual kat situ because atmosphere pun shiok and then makanan pun actually really not bad and then nowadays bugis area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I makan burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
tapi if like that macam susah because from the look of it susah nak travel sebab pasal COVID and then I read up they said that kalau nak travel pun sekarang dah ada banyak measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so macam susah like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but sekarang pun macam end of year pun belum lagi okay everything macam we are still kalau tak salah in phase two
so macam I don't know ah quite susah
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian bakso sedap seh dengan macam chilli sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi roadside makan-makan gitu
dengan dia orang punya soda gembira everything and then the atmosphere orang-orang rokok everything
I want the murtabak manis
oh ya this whole year takde pasar malam seh
luckily my school has some of the pasar malam food like takoyaki all and then like cantine all have the goreng pisang goreng keledek all so okay lah can still tahan but the you zha kueh burger ramly all wah I really miss keropok lekor
and then the susu honeydew tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air sugar cane dia orang suka seh tu rindu seh
and then drink with mango lassi over there sedap seh that time we drink with the mango lassi woo masam tapi manis
ah ya that time yang deepavali that one that adit left halfway
like you see like I never used before right then I was oh okay then didn't think about it then I was like eh rezeki sebab my face wash also nak dekat habis then I actually wanted to buy my new face wash then I saw got new face wash already I was like okay lah can
but I don't think adik will use because adik very particular about his face
oh ya then the perfume nenek give right the bau right stay for very long eh
one after zohor like one two masih ada bau dia like it's very faint but tapi masih ada bau dia and then nenek punya
the lipstick and bedak muka right I pakai right wah it's like eh very nice because the thing is like bedak muka I wanted to I was like I I I
bedak muka I already because like my foundation I needed something to set and then when she gave it to me I was like okay I can use it and then like I used right and then her lipstick I was like eh like wow okay very nice very like very comfortable lah then I was like okay this is like my nenek
no no no the lipstick colour you know dulu dulu nenek has like old photos of her when she go out right then you know that that signature like
then I looked at it right I was like wah actually my lipstick colour and my nenek punya lipstick colour about the same ah because like
nenek wear lipstick like that so I was like wah okay and then when I wore it and then the bedak muka eh okay
but then I didn't dare to share with my friend because like my friend was like asking can I use then I was like no cannot this one my mum punya
adalah kaedah get in the workers are you get everyday
kuih suji is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause uh it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like berat it's just so heavy and
like really tak kisah like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
you the minah that's very bising
why would I wash my selimut
lagi apa eh
untuk err buka business yang
sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa canteen itu murah lah
ya lah tapi masalah dia
err yang
uh dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak
ya boleh masak lah tapi
and those kind of things lah macam nasi putih nasi
err jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu lah baru saya boleh buka
sebab because at schools they have err
so kita kena jual benda yang sama
canteen they they cakap they ada
business lain so dia
dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ lah because
so tapi
sekarang now we are
saya tahu lah apa itu kalau tak ada
ya mm maksud saya yang my first wish yang anak-anak jadi baik itu
bukan baik I mean it's baik overall lah it's good
ya so kalau
err tak ada lah tak ingat
with these variations I I I'm a bit like macam old fashioned lah
masa saya pergi india dulu
err ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik
like macam senapang tau
err tapi dia pergi macam
uh paddy field itu ada banyak burung
burung the one
err apa itu yang warna putih itu yang kaki dia panjang itu apa nama dia
so this pakcik
err will go then they they suka hunt these birds
then they bawa
they bawa then people with cook the meat
err but dia punya daging dia agak it's not soft like chicken tapi agak keras juga lah tapi I only remember I had that once
ya itu sahaja saya try
ya tapi sekarang masa itu saya kecil
sekarang now I'm grown up
bukan itu bukan maksud itu err macam jalan-jalan travel saya tak kisah I'm talking about food
food means all food I'm okay with all food except like macam
um saya boleh rasa macam okay just to taste lah once or twice but I will not make it like my daily consumption kind of thing tak ada
yes harap-harap corona ini over lah so we all can
okay let's say I I tengok satu jam atau dua jam
tapi saya saya err I'm
I sekarang saya suka yang not drag too much
story macam dia punya like short stories lah
macam yang err dia punya
kisah itu habis dalam masa let's say for one dalam one hour two hour tak drag drag drag sampai you know for few episodes ah macam itu saya tak ada patience nak tengok macam
ya it's short I mean apa itu orang cakap apa eh
ya macam itu semua saya suka lah
bila eh
oh twenty twenty three they keluar
macam like um I I also like all the superhero movies
no it's not that aku tak suka cuma I didn't err saya tak you know I didn't sit
the most I I think I watch will be spiderman lah yang banyak
yang saya tengok itu mungkin spiderman tak banyak sangat
bukan lah maybe that's what it's uh
so uh saya nak tanya eh
so you after your sekolah kan after your course you want to work where nak kerja dekat mana
yang itu hari err
yang sofian buat what internship itu it's research more to research right
so you pergi
kan sekarang cuti sekolah
tapi uh you mean
tapi yang you
err punya classmate yang dekat A level itu
ada ambil civil civil engineering
no bukan after A level ada your friends take the same course
so um sofian nak
if if you are considering higher education mana awak nak belajar singapore ke overseas
tak boleh lah mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini then go
ajar budak primary
itu lah saya nak like I said
nak buka business
kalau tak another option would be like macam work from home lah
mah do something like ecommerce ke
normal macam demam macam the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
err macam you know unexpected
err bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit
then memang orang itu dah stress because of the illness
ya so kalau dia tak ada duit
I wish lah if orang yang macam
so they get I think government ada juga lah bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi I wish they
ya itu maybe we can
tapi yang macam chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
itu satu err swimming sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar swimming
err dekat itu
err apa
ya sebab err coach itu boleh datang
mm dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ
I mean uh last time saya pernah ada juga pergi
tapi coach itu walaupun dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh lessons
tapi the coach is like uh not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own mm but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven tapi each lesson itu
ada dia punya itu lah result
so um berenang itu
because sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima
so sekarang
your you know like macam
ada pilates
satu jam is it a group class
dekat mana jurong
ya yang ini pilates saya bukan cari yang
yang pilates itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat itu
tapi ada lagi yang pakai equipments
active itu saya kena check kalau dia orang ada the same kind of pilates
kalau ada uh ya obviously I go for that
active belum
saya pernah pakai untuk swimming pool sahaja pernah
no yang saya cakap itu dulu
itu dekat redhill
so far lah because the coach um yang coach can only come there
ya like I said dulu punya coach itu
the coach uh tapi sekarang punya coach itu
at least ada lah ajar sikit-sikit but I know I would I will take with some
sekarang saya punya itu package remain one more lessons only
no bread toast is just I like lah but not mm not I eat something that I eat rest of my life tapi kalau macam
like macam
kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa eh
ah saya tak tahu lah awak
maggi mee
the nasi arab itu
ya smoke sebab smoke itu tak kuat smoke
then it will you know dia akan hilang cepat
itu bukan keras lah itu
ya tak tak tapi
pizza dekat mana
err you need a little bit of minyak sapi
err depends lah if you want to put it all minyak sapi or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
you boleh you boleh letak rempah-rempah dia like kayu manis buah pelaga is
bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak lah because it's only one cup of rice
then cengkih is clove
macam daun salam is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
err you letak garam
garam then when it when the
water starts to boil you letak itu beras
err nasi minyak you are talking about nasi minyak right
uh nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini
all water they will mix with half half like susu cair
half susu cair half water
no nasi lemak kita letak santan
this is nasi minyak
ya nasi minyak you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit lah
mm then you boleh letak daun pandan daun serai
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also macam you boleh letak tomato
you uh boleh letak chilli hijau semua lah then you put half half lah separuh
uh then the same method you put the uh garam
the other one the taste will be macam kenduri punya nasi lemak lah
ya that one is more like uh is uh more with it goes well with like macam ayam masak merah rendang semua
ya ini nasi minyak simple punya so it goes well with uh curry chicken
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can kau boleh masak dekat sekolah
you punya sekolah itu boleh pakai
you you boleh bawa itu uh
is like it acts like macam bila you nak masak soup with I mean like maggi
boleh nasi boleh lauk pun boleh you only need that one pot which call magic pot I don't know
boleh beli kalau you nak boleh beli yang
entah apa brand lah but I can recommend you few brands
tapi bulan december ini awak cuti kan
abeh are you going back
if you go exchange programme itu dia ambil masa berapa lama one year
audit uh start working oh because dia belum
so dia ada
uh is does dia ada plan untuk balik singapore ke tak
kau nak pergi ke tak
no lah go but you can try like kalau kalau kau suka
like you see the course kalau kau suka
ada lah yang itu yang dulu itu
azam baru dengan veganism
mm mungkin dalam
tapi depend juga lah sebab tengok
err ada
ada have ada deteriorate ke
atau ada apa-apa yang mengubah persepsi dalam morality
depends lah you rasa macam mana
tapi macam ada standpoint morality
apa you punya
oh sebab tu rasa selfish ah
mm itu dia panggil cognitive dissonance err basically
bila you tengok
err dekat certain negara
you boleh tengok dekat YouTube
yang buat video dia tengah makan anjing macam yang video orang korea selalu buat dia kan makan makanan ah jadi kat situ kelakar tau sebab
kita boleh nampak dislike pada video orang yang makan anjing tu banyak tapi bila dia makan steak biasa
ah banyak jer like lepas tu korang comments semua yang elok-elok lah cakap sedap lah tapi bila yang anjing tu ramai yang dislike then bagi comment
yang marah lah marah sebab makan anjing tapi kat situ macam mana dia agak
mm sebenarnya tu memang argument yang orang selalu pakai
err tapi dekat situ timbul satu problem macam mana intelligence satu sentient being diukur macam mana dia orang measure
so dah jadi satu problem kat situ
kalau I sendiri ah rasa mm morally memang kita salah lah kalau nak ikut daripada standpoint moral
I suka juga tengok daripada satu
daripada satu uh
evolutionary standpoint yang mana
kita dah dah mutated dah evolved
sentient being lain though so dah in a way dah adapt sebab tu bila kita cuma nak tinggalkan
mm tradition bukan tradition tinggalkan diet tu dia bagi kesan sampingan pada badan lah sebab banyak juga
orang-orang yang ex-vegan yang dah
last sekali dia orang
dia orang tinggalkan juga veganism sebab
health semakin teruk kan
ah in fact baru five thousand years dari ya yang yang recorded lah five thousand years baru start ada
before that takde yang dikenal pasti lah
itu masa mesopotamia kan
tak I akan start dengan vegetarian dulu sebab macam biasa ah ni
ramai orang yang cakap benda yang sama dia tak boleh tinggalkan cheese
telur yes yes tak boleh
last kita makan beef pun bila
a'ah ah tapi okay lah kira itu tahun lepas punya cerita ini sekarang tahun baru
mm tapi kita kan pernah discuss sebelum ni kalau macam susah
kalau tak nak nampak poyo kita kena buat buat ada macam health issue macam ada allergy ke makan makan meat products
ada allergy jadi kita boleh pura-pura ada
ada illness ah ada penyakit yang tak boleh yang membuatkan kita tak boleh
oh ya lah rasa serba salah rasa guilty dia dah masak kan
I was many tak tahu pun
just just fikir bila dah tengok banyak
banyak debate
then dia macam dia start to make sense lah bila
discussion pasal morality issues
mm back then I consider juga standpoint yang lagi satu lah yang memang
kalau ikutkan daripada organism yang pertama pun memang dia
even plants pun evolve daripada organism yang
yang first
mostly pasal philosophy yang mana yang mana start
start into into betul pun lepas
and jadi banyak masa untuk
untuk reflect
untuk fikir err meaning of life
and then macam-macam lah err
argument macam-macam discussion dapat
dapat tengok sebab free sangat kan banyak free time masa pandemic ni
so daripada situ
dapat counter balik
dapat counter balik permikiran yang sebelum-sebelum ni
bincangkan pasal veganism
dia macam selalu irritating kan annoying macam mana ah
tapi err recently lah dah start macam okay nampak ah kenapa dia
dia make sense
mm ya lah source of protein tu senang nak dapat ya especially is buat tempeh lah
and boleh replace
kita sendiri pun makan sandwich yang hidang dengan tempeh
tapi still once in a while memang rasa craving untuk
err beef too especially bila bayangkan steak
um yang medium rare ah
kat situ lah jadi problem tu dia kita ni
bunuh other sentient being untuk bagi pleasure pada taste bud kita mm ada juga orang yang
yang counter balik dia cakap okay and then macam mana handling dengan nyamuk macam mana dengan err lipas
takkan kita tak boleh nak bunuh kan
err dekat situ itu persoalan yang lain
mm dia orang invasive macam lipas nyamuk ni invasive so dia bukan macam
err lembu lembu kita factory farm and then kita bagi dia life yang teruk just for the sake untuk dapatkan
product just for the sake untuk
ah ha sebab lembu tu dia tak pernah kacau orang pun dia tak ada ah masuk rumah and then hisap darah ke
tapi pun ada juga yang yang certain vegan yang memang sampai to the extremes dia orang tak bunuh nyamuk they just tiup jer a lot macam tu jadi ah yang tu extreme sangat kot
I mean kalau kalau kalau creature lain human ke animal ke
kalau dia start untuk invade tu kita ada right untuk ni lah self-defence lah
anjing ke kalau dia kejar ah kita boleh ah baling batu ke
dia tak nak right untuk
apa-apakan dia lah
macam nak belajar serious pasal philosophy
apa lagi ah
tak tahu you start dulu nanti I boleh tiru you
ya lah tak even even for me as a musician
mm mm dia tak tak strong rasa macam nak
nak improve bukan
ada lah rasa nak improve tapi nak sebab nak practise tu dia macam tak motivated sangat dia macam ada nak
nak cari benda lain mm mm I mean music tu kita punya
kita punya career tapi
dia dia stay macam tu lah then kita akan improve tu maybe while ah then while while working while performing
mm mm itu memang
memang best
mm mm tapi sia
almost apa memang lah
vaccine pun
february baru masuk malaysia kita pun tak tahu ya ke tak singapore dah
mm a'ah jadi pasal language ya I tengah focus juga dengan nak focus greek ah greek dulu lepas tu italian yang
yang senang-senang ah dulu
mm mm mm japanese tu dia considered as
uh dia orang pernah sort of difficulty kan then lepas tu
err hardest language to learn lah dia ada sekali dengan arab tapi yang tu dia measure dia ikut ni err
perspective orang orang yang
yang speak english ah mm tapi mungkin untuk kita asian
maybe japanese tak susah mana kot
ah dia among the easiest
a'ah latin juga sebenarnya latin mm
aduh susah lah tak pernah ada azam
dia benda-benda yang beyond beyond our control macam contohnya nak nak border dibuka semula
tapi tu lah dia kena ni benda tu beyond our control lah yang
yang in our control
tak tahu ah sebab rasa macam semua benda boleh dapat sekarang
desire tu macam tak tahu nak apa ah
ya lah memang
memang takde takde isu pun lah twenty twenty tu cuma travel restriction jer lah itu jer
walaupun restricted pun kita dapat juga daripada penang ke perak ke johor
december ya lah sebab kita dapat hanya
mm working from home lepas tu dengan dia sebab dia new experience kan kita buat voice voice acting gitu
benda yang kita tak pernah buat jadi ah okay ah
predict ah apa apa yang malaysia akan
tahun ni lah ah twenty twenty one yang dia ah
ah predict lah macam mana
mm but then again memang ramai lah yang buat online content cuma lama-lama tengok rasa macam
boring juga sebab
mm contoh
contoh macam music lah kalau yang lain okey-dokey kalau yang macam discussion debates semua okay lagi kalau yang music ni macam lama-lama jadi boring ah tengok online ah redundant lepas tu
lepas tu tengok bayangkan lah dah err you have to pay the ticket but
memang lah dia orang buat dekat
ah venue venue yang ada sound system yang best
tapi still benda tu dia depend juga macam mana dengan uh audio system
audience masing-masing ada pakai err earphone yang murah earphone handphone mahal ke apa ke so dia still quality dia
tak main peranan sangat lah
mm mm especially kalau memang dah semua orang dah dapat vaccine betul
eh mesti lah
mesti ah mesti kita akan buat event
takde ah
it can kelakar jer tapi takpe ah kalau orang tak nak
ambil vaccine kan dekat sini kan memang err kalau
err siapa yang nak ambil vaccine itu could
ni lah secara sukarela kan volunteer kan
so biar lah yang tu
mm mm siapa yang tak nak tu kita serahkan kepada yes
I rasa nanti kalau macam dia jadi back to normal dia akan ada ya lah dia akan
um celebrate sekejap dia akan macam wow ah finally dunia luar
mm tapi rasanya benda tu takkan dia punya excitement tu dia takkan tahan lama pun dia macam sekejap jer and then orang lupa balik sebab
err even masa
pandemic ni pun dengan dengan semua orang ada internet memang literally semua orang ada
daripada socialising ah so macam dia dia
not a big deals sangat pun pandemic ni cuma memang lah ah physically
mm memang tapi uh physically memang lah dia orang crave untuk jumpa depan-depan tapi sebab ada internet ni
dan tu lah sebab tu nanti excitement dia akan sekejap jer
oh tapi err
nanti bila bila dah normal balik maybe semua orang boleh jumpa secara fizikal tapi dengan dengan perspective yang baru lah ah maybe sebab dia dah banyak spend time sebelum ni dia dia walaupun dia banyak free time untuk
err walaupun smartphone memang ada kat dalam tangan sentiasa tapi dia orang banyak tengok
macam content content yang wasteful lah yang macam setakat tengok meme jer
tapi masa pandemic ni macam ramai pula yang
dia tiba subscribed to a skillshare ah ambil
ah kelas-kelas yang macam-macam kan so dia dah start gunakan free time dia betul-betul and then dia betul-betul masuk ke dalam dunia internet yang positif ah
so dia dapat banyak gila input
ada shift
yes and no biasa jer biasa jer yes tu sebab
sebab kita travel kan kita dapat pergi
mm pergi keluar kita dapat
and then mm masa kita masuk pandemic baru nak start pun kita memang baru balik kan
so benda-benda tu memang rindu lah benda-benda tu tapi
daripada tahun yang pandemic ni pun
not bad juga so dia macam dah biasa
mm boleh lah memang
memang naturally stoic kot
rumit lah kan ah tak lah in in a nutshell dia just pasal
pasal being remaining neutral lah dia macam
bukan pessimist dan bukan optimist ni in a in a nutshell lah mm dia punya actual definition dia tak pasti lah macam mana tapi in a nutshell yang I faham
remain tegak jer tau ah macam
kalau benda teruk jadi yang beyond kita punya control and then apa yang kita boleh buat ah just
and then bila
datang satu benda excitement pun
jangan jangan terlalu ah jangan telalu absorbed jangan terlalu soaked in dalam feeling yang
yang kuat tau sebab nanti dia akan ada
apa pendulum effect
mm dia akan bidas balik
nihilism tapi tak lah nihilism
boleh lah nihilism ni dia just
except yang kalau kalau kalau
kalau life ni takde meaning pun
takpe lah sebab ada orang dia macam strive untuk cari meaning dia
tapi what if
memang takde meaning apa-apa memang
datang dan pergi macam tu jer kan just play along jer lah
ah memang ah
mm kalau ni memang banyak refer pada nature ah tapi
mm okay sebenarnya dia dia bukannya
err bukan yang teruk sebab ada juga term optimistic nihilism
mm mm before that memang ada encounter tu tapi good place tu dia macam lagi explaining dia explaining lah
mm kalau kau tak tahu pun macam tak tahu pun benda ni dibincangkan cuma
sebelum ni kita experience kan kita macam
mm start ada turning point untuk
ah rasa macam dapat revelation in something
and then bila tengok memang ada
memang ada study pasal ni err seronok lah sebab dia explain kan
mm hmm hmm memang lah memang tak boleh shaft pun tapi boleh
boleh introduce lah introducing okay tapi bila shaft
shaving new opinion tu
tak boleh lah
oh macam tu boleh cakap apa ah
macam tu boleh cakap lah
tak tau ah other than philosophy takde mmhmm
kali nak nak lebihkan pada scandinavian countries tu
mm sebab nak tengok
mm tengok system dia
mm ya lah yang tu semua memang nak repeat
tapi ah a'ah a
termasuk lah
kalau tak kan
lepas lepas bukan sweden denmark mm
euro centric tak tak western lah
sebab kita tak consider canada ya tapi
sebab dia punya ni kot dia punya historical value
kalau asian countries entah north korea
mm mm sebab tu
sebab tu macam history kat sini pun kadang-kadang dengar pun macam made up stories sebab dia tak perlu preserve kan
aiyo tak tahu pun
mm mm tapi the sangat kan
takde lah dia bukannya kalau being stoic ke macam terus eliminate ke
so sebab lagi muda lagi orang akan
ambil seriously kot sebab dia tengok macam umur lima belas dah start buat semua ni
lepas tu tapi still ambil lah sebab nanti mungkin boleh guna untuk summer study kan
mm apa lagi ah tukar
entah tukar nama tak ah tak tahu lah
takde tak against sangat pun against ah against against sekolah semua sekolah yang I pergi
I went to seven schools and takde yang betul-betul
dapat tarik interest untuk belajar kan dia punya
ya lah ini memang lah semua orang faham lah mm bukan kita jer faham semua orang tahu benda ni
kalau korang start
sembang pasal education system jer lah memang macam gini jer lah dia punya outcome
kat internet
tapi ada laptop kan
ambil ah
entah macam mana kalau lockdown lagi kan tak guna
bukan a'ah
hampa jer
mm lapan minit ni
boleh cakap pasal apa your hope was a upper you hook
pada home country you
boleh ke ah okay
uh sebenarnya stoic juga ah mm
tu lah change yang nak tengok
ya lah dia beyond kita punya control kan tapi still okay lah kalau betul ada change yang boleh nak tengok nak tengok
a'ah maknanya takde campur tangan
tak tak kesah lah politician ke sesiapa pun banyak yang kalau nak
some sort of gain dia akan main dengan
a'ah dengan sentiment agama kan mm
just kalau nak tengok ni boleh lah tengok kat Facebook comments jer dah cukup dah
so banyak yang memang tak
biasa ah benda ni biasa yang dia nampak tajuk jer lepas tu dia terus comment mm mm
itu pun uh itu
a'ah a'ah a'ah betul
kita kena blame juga journalism bad journalism dia memang
tak boleh ah dia dia kena fikir lah uh siapa
dia kena fikir juga untuk orang yang malas membaca ni dia kena bagi title tu memang terus
mm click bait okay tapi kalau kalau buat video YouTube okay kot
tapi kalau buat err news header jangan lah
sebab tu lah yang orang baca pasal vaksin ni juga ada side effect eh bukan side effect dia dah ambil ah
mm mm padahal baru ambil yang first shot tu kan
tapi orang terus rasa macam cakap oh K maknanya vaksin tak berkesan atau apa lah
ya lah memang itu yang dia jadi sepanjang adanya
it is err sejak kelahiran journalism
yang penting jalan yang penting dapat duit advertisement mm
tapi itu lah benda ni yang kita memang dah selalu sangat sembang teliti macam tu lah lagi authentic
mm kita dah bual benda ni dah dah berapa kali dah sebelum ni sorry
ini call of duty
contoh pergi makan ah
kita pergi makan ini lah seoul garden
pun boleh juga wakuwaku pun boleh juga
bawa duit ah wakuwaku mahal daripada seoul garden kan
can ah jalan masjid pun okay juga

ah tapi dalam gambar tu ada empat
drumstick dengan chicken wing attach together

cause the cause dia orang ada that promotion tau apa twelve piece at nine ninety

iya lah nanti you watch your more than family
I want to watch my drama tomorrow so sakit hati
is it yang is it yang reflect journal is it the journal yang
a'ah I can hear you snoring from the hall itu lah it reminds me macam aku punya poly days whenever aku tengok muka kau penat kan like macam it reminds me of my poly
that's why kau akan nampak aku selalu satu malam jer dekat rumah tak buat apa-apa actually aku duduk dalam bilik fikir fikir-fikir benda but then
kau pun nampak ah at end of the day bila aku macam submission aku macam oh chill and happy and everything sebab tak fikir banyak then when is the start the semester start balik lah all the stress and all the macam eh don't disturb me now don't talk to me don't don't whatever don't
eh but kalau aku boleh pull through aku lagi design background I don't have any design background kita madrasah we don't have any art school tak ada D&T art and craft I cannot draw a straight line ke apa-apa but then
okay I cannot draw a circle straight line boleh with a ruler but then still aku manage to pull through ah so macam aku selalu tengok
kau stress kan aku fikir macam ah lah you are left with err one and a half more years you are already in two point two ah so are you excited for three point one chey
huh but you are in a school what kau kat polytechnic semua benda kau task to do you complete what
eh that actually happen to me bila poly uh apa ni bila during internship whereby aku punya internship kan aku design web design dengan digital pin
abeh time tu aku punya task untuk buat it was already aku punya internship was just three months long sebab kita punya panjang abeh
during aku eh three to four months internship so during macam like the first one third of the internship I had to design something for an overseas museum
so aku nak kena design macam dorang punya apa ni interactive punya benda and it's not even a topic that is being touched on dekat poly tak ada pun imagine kau kena buat punya benda
kira macam code tapi untuk punya system orang letak I pad dorang boleh scan abeh kita orang nak kena design that code
and actually at the start of the project it was only me and I had to design for four building pasal museum dia ada four buildings then I had to design all four outer thing so that when visitor datang dorang boleh scan benda tu initially aku kena buat sorang-sorang
then kau internship sama-sama dengan kawan lah ask your friend to internship like sama-sama company like apply together
mana tahu like macam kalau tak kan my company tiga orang apply three people apply me and apa ni kawan aku yang lelaki yang end up dengan sama-sama internship and another aku punya close friend but in the end dorang reject my close friend sebab ada dua intern kat company tu and dorang can only like
hire two interns at that point of time and is a good thing dia ada sebab dia more vocal than aku so macam because
I think it's because it's an environment whereby I'm not comfortable with it's an environment aku tak comfortable jadi macam
aku take a very long time to berbual even dengan aku punya supervisor but luckily but the thing is during aku punya internship kan is not the supervisor my supervisor dia macam assign assign benda jer dia cuma assign aku for one task which is to
it's a mural wall for a company yang dia dah buat cuma bila dia send dekat client client nak kena revise so aku yang revise that file which in the end bila aku submit balik sebelum aku habis internship aku punya supervisor kata aku buat salah abeh by then client dah accept aku punya design so macam hmm pandai-pandai lah kau kau betulkan aku punya file tapi client dah macam eh okay macam gitu tapi during aku punya internship was
aku punya kira macam senior one of kita orang punya senior dia macam higher sikit dari supervisor punya position dia yang apa ni uh overlook aku dengan ni pasal aku ada tiga project afterwards kan so this tiga project was overlook macam dia oversee kita punya design work bukan aku punya supervisor
cuma dia pasal aku punya mural wall
tapi client dah accept so macam aku nak pergi balik tempat tu abeh tengok mural wall tu pasal it's for pasal dorang sewa tempat this company punya one of the room so mural wall dia ada dekat company itu so macam kalau aku tebalkan muka maybe boleh datang tengok tapi jangan pergi atas lah
huh macam mana
dia punya company dia buat apa as in what is the
research pasal
ah but then dia punya nature of the work tak perlukan dia to be in office lain macam like certain
courses ataupun kerja yang macam there was one guy the same area as aku punya internship pasal aku punya office based kan dia punya another group of friend from different course tapi kita orang punya course related to mass communication eh dorang bukan mass comm dorang communication design aku punya interactive media design so dorang punya is like dekat
macam printing factory tau so aku tak tahu whether kalau during that time lah if is like during period
abeh kalau kau macam magazine ke newspaper ke cetak buku sekolah ke
abeh siapa nak jaga machine kat sana
wah rabak seh can't imagine myself if during imagine you
kau ada kawan year one kan
ah lagi especially kita madrasah student kan jadi kita tak pernah exposed to like apa ni people from different races
different ya ke like macam all this while korang berbual kat sekolah berbual melayu jer pe
ah okay lah like during my time is like total culture shock aku kena joget semua
wah like looking back right macam haram sia aku buat semua
ah kau tak regret
ya I remember ya you had a apa ni project during secondary school I scolded you for like macam huh benda macam gini simple pun tak boleh buat ya that is so
pathetic pun ada
actually honestly kan like since aku first kan among kita punya siblings kan so macam aku tak ada kakak or abang to ask things from mummy and is like totally apa ni dorang tak tahu apa-apa and they depend on me kalau tak pun dorang tanya cik shahrul macam mana nak anuh ni semua kan dulu bila aku start pun kau nak tahu apa aku tanya kawan-kawan aku can imagine last time before kita ada internet at home
like I will go to the library my friend yang pandai internet
they will actually accompany me to the library and last time library we can rent hours pakai dia punya internet computer remember so aku pergi sana dorang tolong buatkan aku punya email dorang tolong buatkan aku punya friendster and things like that
yes it was really that bad tak akan aku nak tunjuk and you like what kindergarten lagi pe time tu like time tu I was
okay kau baru primary kan
no it was like primary four primary six ya lah ya so primary four primary six yang kita jalan gi apa ni bedok library no you know when I start reading book secondary one
or ask everytime nak pergi mana then I say or else mummy tanya aku macam kak nak gi mana nak pergi library so last time kalau nak buat research ke apa pergi library ah abeh tu then bila abi beli computer letak dekat bilik that's when slowly but then kita pakai internet untuk buat apa tengok youtube video game
ya so dulu pun macam struggle pun struggle sendiri juga like macam ah yes and that's the ni apa ni
aku by the time kan boleh nampak beza tau so time tu aku ingat masa aku tuition ah aku tuition dengan kak mon kak mon sama umur kan cuma aku first child dia third
so bila kita kat tuition I never felt the difference between me and mon so aku rasa macam kita orang sama merepek sama-sama ketawa sama-sama like we learn together we grew up together like we had silat and everything like that and like on these last few days of the kita orang punya tuition ni the kakak cakap
ah mar anak nombor berapa then I say first then mun berapa oh patut lah nampak beza then I was like huh there is a difference macam dia kata in how I do my work in how responsibility in how I act even though I feel like I act as childish as her macam aku merepek-merepek pun there is still a difference between
tu lah so last time aku struggle ah kau nampak aku macam I had it all like some uh macam senang but actually I had to learn a lot of things by myself like macam mana nak pakai computer macam mana nak buat ni nak buat report macam mana nak buat homework okay of course I had tuitions lah back then but
dapat laptop
itu lah susah kan dulu hidup
and tak macam dulu
macam kau sekarang by then even though when you ask me how to do certain things I would macam huh benda macam gini pun kau tak tahu
but then kau imagine kau and last time it was not as apa ni is not an in thing
it is still new to the whole generation tau so macam memang kena belajar and last time I honestly I was one of the macam lembab
macam everyone have already have email friendster imagine the year aku buat friendster
dah tak popular by then I am not sure if it was facebook oh I think it was facebook facebook atau messenger it was the messenger yang popular
kau tak tahu messenger apa kan
dia macam chatting punya benda
itu pun I only
ya I only ya it's either hotmail ke microsoft so tapi by then aku dah ada messenger terus facebook dah popular so macam bila orang berbual pasal friendster aku macam hmm oh I also had friendster oh nama apa then I was like
if you okay kalau aisha ada time okay lah I know aisha baru masuk poly life kan like primary secondary poly two point two out of these stages of your life which one macam pada kau paling memorable sekali
rabak in what sense
tak ada satu pun jadi monitor ni atas dasar terpaksa pun jadi lah
since but bila first time kau jadi monitress kan was it chosen by the form teacher or also was yes aku tahu aku favourite child favourite student
so sorry imagine if you were in school when we were still in school both me and abang
bila ni which year oh my god okay the cat is out of the bag secondary four it was during secondary four
for what subject for what subject cakap jer lah dah lepas pun
ah class ni tak payah dengar lah
kat ear punya height oh
tak tinggi mana shoulder oh
it's about the thing is we've known each other since primary school because unlike you you are the system whereby after primary six you pilih which madrasah you want to go whether you want to focus academic girl probably but during kak punya time
kita orang tak ada pilihan unless you choose to change school then kita change school kalau tak all the way kita in the same school lah
so time tu bila dah masuk secondary kan bila primary kan kita orang macam
whereby madam rosanna was our form teacher and she taught us everything dia ajar
dia ajar ah english maths and science
so she taught all this three subjects okay so during lessons where everyday kita orang akan mix so someday we just do all english
whereby all of us work together you know one whole class ah like thirty five of us work together madam rosanna being herself a creative teacher she like do art project untuk kita orang semua and that's how we became closer especially during ah like even though there was six main members but behind the scenes like we came back to school during the june holidays
ah during the june holidays lepas itu kita orang apa ni buat artworks for example ah old vases kita orang paint balik to sell during our end kita orang punya tempat yang kita for the competition was at tampines mall you know where dorang have the bazaar sebelah tampines mall
every ramadan they have the bazaar hari raya
no even now yang kalau ada bazaar dekat tampines
yes so that was where we held the competition and everyone came imagine one of aku punya classmate dia kau tahu yang vanguard sheet it's not vanguard is it yang colour colour purple colour blue macam vanguard sheet oh my god it's been so long since I used that word vanguard sheet ah
so dia pakai macam vanguard sheet depan belakang and then dia jual envelope macam untuk envelope macam salam kahwin salam hari raya kita orang fold from wrapping paper and at the end of competition kita orang punya class dapat eh kita orang punya sekolah we first time arabia masuk and kita orang menang dapat fourth position
all thanks to madam rosanna so but she put the most effort lah because we were like only primary four kita berapa years old then ten years old we don't tak tahu banyak benda kan so then after that when kita orang dah bersatu hati bersatu padu primary four bila primary five kita split class
they just tak ada
so last time during my dorang tak ada my time right dorang tak ada macam ah yang pandai
yang paling pandai yang pandai yang perlu bantuan untuk jadi lebih pandai tu tiga kan dorang tak ada split so all of us are in one class so it must have been a struggle for those yang susah juga lah
korang seven levels seh A B C D E F six okay
oh because they want you guys to focus on studies or ah but did you look forward to that camp so tak ada lah kesah sangat
antisocial lah tu so okay back tu aku punya cerita so bila primary five kita split class tau abeh kita orang punya class ground level ground level kan so satu class satu class it all happen when mummy kan dah start jual kan kat situ so aku selalu stay back
so I think there was a kita orang punya senior ke apa tak puas hati dengan some girl from of course lah boy so dorang macam unhappy with the between class five A and five B ah so boyfriend kat five B suka girl kat five A girl kat five A suka lelaki kat five B but lucky for five B they actually stayed back during primary six so girls primary six tak puas hati
so what happen was like one of kita orang punya time find that I always stay back pasal mummy jualan kan kat sekolah kan so aku tunggu lah mummy habis baru balik sama-sama what happen was them knowing that I always stay back you know what they do dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
ada a few clique until today aku masih ingat pasal that is the same clique
who koyakkan aku punya duty roster bila secondary one
kalau dengar okay so dorang dah koyakkan the duty roster and the next day bila five B datang dorang cakap lah aku yang koyakkan
sebab aku yang stay back
yes and ya ya pasal aku tak hold grudge sangat aku hold grudge yang secondary one punya tapi semua dah besar
so lepas tu then after that after that whole incident
mengamuk ah
tak ah because it was just not me I was with another friend kita orang sama-sama
ah macam tak mungkin aku koyakkan by the time akak balik dia pun balik so all this while kita orang sama-sama but the other class knowing that aku yang selalu stay back tunggu mummy
then dorang ni ah
or maybe bila aku tak ada dekat class I didn't stay at the classroom what I will just stay at the musollah ataupun dekat luar
ah so what happen afterwards was kita orang start to have extra classes after school hours so that's where the whole saga started dorang sembunyikan kasut hilangkan pencil box it's like to the extent one day after school semua orang kena stay back semua dari five A semua dari five B kena stay back aku daripada five A kan dengar
dorang tak tahu tu primary six aku tahu pasal siapa lagi yang stay back tapi pasal dia senior aku tak ada senior lagi nak tolong aku so it happen to the extent that madam rosanna form teacher kita orang bila primary four gather kita orang balik untuk berbual dengan kita orang
then I say you were together last year macam sama-sama apasal bila masuk primary five semua macam gini things like that so in the end kita salam and dah habis ah
tak ada orang nak mengaku sebab tak ada proof
we didn't have any proof that it was primary six but I knew because I know this kakak-kakak stay back
and I knew the history of all this aku kan orang tengah semua benda aku tahu ah yes
ya tapi time rapat dengan dia so ya
tu lah kakak tak suka tu primary five bila but then bila dah masuk secondary kita masih split class sampai secondary one time tu pun sec one a lawan dengan sec one B
pasal kita just annoyed dengan dorang like there was this one trend semua orang akan pakai this jacket do you know my jacket bukan varsity jacket it was before varsity jacket it was like a hoodie jacket yang kau tahu yang grey and another pink
pink dengan blue star aku selalu pakai bila bila it was that trend that kind of jacket and ya backpack kat belakang do you know what aku punya backpack yang colour brown yang boleh clip ya okay it was a trend and there's this one group of girls dorang pakai tu
and I was so annoyed pasal dorang macam flaunt dorang punya because it was in trend and dorang macam flaunt and the whole group nanti ambil gambar and things like that abeh aku annoyed gila seh so aku pun tak suka dorang then comes the teacher day punya time tau so bila tengah teacher day punya time one of aku punya classmate instead of tolong decorate aku punya class
dia pergi kelas sebelah tolong decorate kan kelas sebelah kita orang dah macam oh my god abeh kita orang memang tak puas hati dengan dorang until dorang secondary one
then bila kita orang masuk secondary two kita sama kelas balik
kita orang different class after that bila masuk balik secondary everyone was in the same class secondary two pasal by then pun kita dah pindah dekat toa payoh kan so classroom dah lagi besar so bila yang secondary two tu
kita orang macam ada certain orang kita tak click sebab dia gatal
but other certain students we are okay with them ah by then kita dah quite click then after that bila masuk secondary three end of secondary three kita ada secondary three camp
ah whereby dalam secondary three camp because we have never been in situation whereby kita orang semua sama-sama except kita orang punya macam apa ni tidur kat sekolah bulan ramadan punya time
so other than kita orang semua tak sama-sama actually bila camp itu lah semua orang start rapat
um level one ni kat sekolah mana
I think the only time whereby kita orang tak tidur sekolah so last time kita ada was one week and
apa ni kita orang ada arabic paper and among all the paper of course arabic language paling susah kan so what was ustazah mashallah beterima kasih dia sanggup tidur a day before the paper I think that was thursday kira arabic paper was on friday so dia tidur kat sekolah dengan kita orang so the reason why kita semua tidur kat sekolah was to revise our arabic
and in the end we didn't really revised instead kita of course girls being girls when we are together kita orang ketawa-ketawa and the thing is only girls yang tidur
kat sekolah and there was only one ustaz and another male student to accompany the ustaz lah is the only guy in school ustaz was there to look after us lah tak akan kalau all girls kalau apa-apa jadi kat sekolah apa jadi kan
then after that during kita orang punya ni ada something happen again so kita orang tidur dekat creepy honestly even bila camp bila ada kat situ itu jangan cakap aku buat bodoh and last time tak ada cermin last time there was no mirrors then we bila dah new sikit that is scary lah so last time bila masih tengah kat kita orang semua tengah duduk it was already at eleven plus
mah then kita orang pun dah habis revise because we going to wake up earlier before subuh the next day to like refresh before we keep school because school kat sekolah kan exam dia esok pagi semua student datang balik ah dekat arabiah dekat hall
then lepas tu
no I don't think it was in hall it was in one of the classroom yang tingkat dua hujung sini yang facing parade square I think it was there
lepas tu what happen was we were just talking amongst ourselves and you know the sound whereby kereta jalan then bunyi imagine ustaz muhammad kereta was parked
no he was parked there he was parked way before so tak gerakkan kereta pun semua orang
yang kereta jalan ya
park kereta dekat depan
oh yang sebelah security punya ya
and it couldn't be from the road pasal road dah jauh
so kakak punya the more okay I
tak pernah experience benda-benda seram
sampai orang point out
so meaning ataupun staycation ingat staycation dekat dengan old changi hospital
I know the place is eerie but I don't sense or feel pasal aku tak nak takutkan diri aku sendiri macam kau tahu aku takut tengok cerita hantu kan so macam
aku macam tahu tempat dia very eerie very seram
our chalet time kita ambil yang paling hujung sekali kan tapi aku tak cakap apa-apa cuma bila dah habis the whole thing baru orang cakap kau rasa bila oh it wasn't only me
ah tapi okay tapi itu bukan the most scariest experience aku ada the one imagine ada satu kali tu kita orang ada staycation eh bukan staycation yang chalet dekat pasir ris
pasir ris holiday flat time itu pasir ris holiday flat baru renovate lagi sekali tau they just renewed renovated that's why kita the year before is at changi yang kita ambil
then the following year baru kita buat kat pasir ris pasal dorang dah renovate tempat dia so ah so that time aku pasal aku tak boleh overnight that day kita orang buat barbecue aku tolong the day before
pasal after that day barbecue kan kita balik siang cik shahrul fetch kita orang
so I decided to help a day earlier because kita ambil four days three night so thursday just ambil kunci friday datang petang decorate prepare benda-benda barbecue then saturday the event barbecue some more then saturday is the event sunday is the punya macam retreat pasal tengah ada submission
poly submission so yang tolong cuma lima orang jer akak
kak sumayah dengan lagi tiga kakak ni ah kak jah kak nana kak nisa so kita orang semua tengah bersih-bersih sekali dorang kena beli benda tau
dorang nak kena dorang nak kena beli benda then okay ah tinggal kakak dengan kak maya tengah prepare pasal kak maya in charge of the creation
so aku tolong ah kak maya potong-potong benda tampal-tampal semua untuk batik remember the batik thing yang korang dapat EZ-link
sticker batik ah ah yes yes ah backdrop dia punya backdrop
so nak kena kemas-kemas then after that terus dorang balik so dorang balik dorang letak benda and still nak kena keluar beli benda tau
so then it was three of us sekejap lagi tengah buat kerja thirty minutes ke apa later
terus google punya ni google no it was google ah google ah atau SIRI SIRI ada pakai iphone
don't say anything don't say anything tengah buat kerja
astaghfirullah astaghfirullah then after that terus balik ah imagine balik kul dua belas lebih daripada pasir ris
kau tahu kan the chalet we slept is tengah-tengah laut eh is at hujung depan dia laut pokok-pokok pasir ris park
so like terus kita orang macam hmm that was the
scary experience pasal aku sendiri dengar I myself heard
that thing that beyond that macam aku kadang is it my just my imagination is it something that because from all those ghost story yang aku tengok or was it just me but this one everyone heard and everyone was like macam
okay let's not talk about this anymore so then cepat-cepat ah habiskan dorang yang tidur sana selamat macam gitu
but you don't seem like one aku nak tengok cerita hantu
for telegram ke
classroom yang mana which classroom
keep pointing fingers but no knowing who is the dia punya ni
mengundang kan mengundang
but those one of the stupid things korang buat lepas aku it was polytechnic punya time like it was during it was between kita orang punya from one class to another oh from one consultation to another consultation the session kalau tak salah eh
so macam daripada april to like before the september october september holiday I take a few module then after september october november is so september october november was my internship december came back to school for
then kita orang tengah tengok so from one class to another class is like three hours break pasal kita orang punya class straight so during that three hours we have our own lepak place and only we can enter only my course mates can enter the class ah tap to masuk
pasal lain semua tak boleh masuk so it became our macam hangout room for our course ah
so what happened was the dia punya laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
tak tahu macam mana dia buat terus boleh pakai projector semua so kita have access to main cerita dia macam cupboard dia buka
dia yang buka the whole thing ah so kita buat
tak ada lah dia just pakai macam ruler I don't know how he open I think it was just a macam he needs to put his hand into something to take out the wire that connects from the laptop to the projector so he managed to do that so even when the lecturer pass by dorang pun tak cakap apa-apa so
tak ada apa-apa lah so should be okay so kita tengok movie so like majority of us were in the class tengah tengok movie and
since dia is a glass door dia glass door kita kena orang luar boleh nampak kita but then the glass door dia tutup dengan projector kau faham ah so kita facing projector belakang projector glass door kira orang lalu boleh nampak tengah tengok so like macam some of my classmate dorang tak nak duduk tengok movie dorang nak keluar or lepak with others the mix ah from different courses or just nak pergi lunch so one of aku punya kawan masuk dia cakap eh what you guys are watching you know what we are watching shaun the sheep
seven eh bukan eighteen nineteen eighteen to like the oldest one twenty six umur yang twenty six yang buka cerita shaun the sheep kau faham tak so we were watching shaun the sheep abeh kelakar-kelakar dah ketawa ketawa ketawa after that kita tengok cerita apa tau final destination five
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend yang shaun the sheep keluar dia masuk balik kan kita tengok final destination five dia macam wow you guys ah asal tengok one cerita to the other tapi kita tengok pun ketawa-ketawa but that was one of the best ni lah
and another best thing I yang kita orang pernah buat was
main hide and seek dekat airport
akak punya clique my clique dengan a few guys so time tu kita orang dah habis
I think sebab kita orang habis sekolah siang ke apa ke pasal that day I think that day was
kita orang main terminal two kita orang main terminal two ah kita orang main hide and seek the thing is kita orang tak boleh hide dekat toilet ah pasal boys tak boleh masuk girls toilet girls tak boleh masuk but it was so fun
should play like if you have like a large group of friends to play main hide and seek paling best
ah teman
kau dah dengar cerita aku punya bukan cerita seram kelakar seram ah so during kita orang punya
secondary four secondary five kita pergi malaysia
tak lah no is different tak ada during our time tak ada such thing
so was when the graduating batch went a year before they graduate kita pergi overseas kita pergi malaysia and visit universities to macam kononnya future nak kenal-kenal ah universities luar singapore
so kita orang semua dapat bilik hotel okay lah actually ni cerita seram ah
so kita orang dapat bilik hotel so there are kita orang dibagi like our classes are being divided into three levels so example dia level seven eight nine so level seven semua guys
level nine semua girls
so macam guys punya room this thing is the guys room is sebelah depan girls room sebelah belakang
jauh daripada lift so you have to walk in like macam and my room is one of the last few room for that floor kita orang punya that level kita punya room last few
and kak mun was also on the same floor so kita dua bukan the type yang akan takut because we usually travel go hotel kan so macam benda ni tak akan occur unless before this kita ada dengar orang-orang berbual which
unfortunately they did talk about or all these things that happen in their room lah so time tu kita ada ada macam seminar sekejap atau kat atas kat macam dia punya hall ah so aku dengan kak mun pun terlupa something so kita orang kena rush pergi bilik so kak mun dengan bilik aku sama level ah
so kita masuk terus time tu ada hall and it's a long way tau like macam ah the corridor macam panjang have to pass by around ten rooms
the room dia macam zig zag
so kak mun punya room is around seven aku punya room eleven tak salah
sama floor tak ada dalam bilik tu ada empat orang dua sec five dua sec four dua sec five dua sec four dorang split macam gitu ah
terus aku tengok kak mun tengok each other lari masuk bilik letak benda lari
patah balik all the way
itu the worst experience
tak they dim the whole the very old school punya macam yellow light corridor and the carpet was red
ah tadi kerja macam mana
oo jadi
habis participants pun sikit ah
jadi dia orang bawa banyak duit ah kalau berapa banyak hari macam gitu
um jadi ah apa habis tapi tiga orang jer kan tadi
tadi dari um apa sektor
tak ada lah
tak tadi nenek tak pekik ah apa pagi dia terbangun then dia pekik sekejap lah sebab ini tapi biasa lah dia tak ada dia punya maki-maki hamun lah
then I think dia lapar biasa dia minta pergi toilet tapi dia tak minta solat solat lagi ah dia tak I think because dia nampak mak keluar pergi kerja kan jadi dia tahu dia seorang seorang dengan bibik jadi dia diam aje
um so entah um tak ada anxiety tak ada ah
tapi selalu panggil doktor lepas tu dia orang cakap apa pasal anxiety pill tu
I think err tapi is susah to say ah that this is still moderate like I mean moderate I think is kalau nak cakap apa um penyakit yang bila atau paling terhangat kan like you know heat at the peak right moderate lah is should say I think anything more than this um
I think anything more than this kena redha lah
compared to the past tiga hari lalu lah yang
tapi dia ni memang dari dulu selalu apa bila dia bila orang dekat dengan kita orang apa go nak pergi dia kan selalu at her top
um tak tak senang lah reckless lah lepas tu ah apa terkebil-kebil mata dia kan
tapi nenek timid timid kemarahan dia tahap singa
eh hari tu ambil test yang dapat test dementia tak
ah tapi macam mana sebab test dia kelakar kelakar tanya soalan kan
the dementia I pernah nampak ah like the test to do
um bila kita cakap pasal dementia kita pernah nampak test dia apa um dulu dekat tempat kerja sekarang kena buat dia tapi nama test abbreviated mental test or something
A&T kan then apa macam ada dia orang cakap kat situ I tell you the number one nine seven two
huh what is it ah actually you are supposed to go and get her like tested that like for five years ago like when it was at the peak of the light where she keep asking is it already azan is it time to pray is you already azan then you can get their diagnoses which is at the mild stage because right now already at the moderate right
it is there's some like the guidelines to ah diagnose mental conditions susah like it is continuous assessment because ah apa
doctor cakap macam okay dah dia ni he show like five out ah like out of ten he show eight sign then ya diagnosed with dementia or depression but then apa
doesn't mean just depression kadang-kadang kalau dia datang enam bulan later sekali I am very depressed but I can hear voices in my head telling me to jump down
ah tu dah schizophrenia tu but then you see is like mental condition is terlalu susah cause
it's continuous assessment that's why dementia you'd all these mental condition you get diagnosed early you are follow up by doctor psychiatrist early like continuously so they know they see a progression dia ni oh dia ni dah tukar dah lain
just depression kadang-kadang datang enam bulan later sekali
tapi memang dah ada dah lama pun dia orang abandon yang dekat malaysia pun dia orang hantar apa mak dia orang sebab nursing home dekat situ lagi murah then but you cannot blame lah dia orang kerja apa mana ada orang ada time nak jaga mak bapa kat rumah it's like
tapi kalau kita tengok dalam islam kan macam mana
I think kalau you nak ikut yang orang europe punya is that kita first of all kita singapore tak ada space tapi kalau ada space kita boleh buat tapi dia orang buat dia orang tak buat nursing home dia orang buat macam nursing bilik you know
a nursing home right is very strict like you have to be inside there are because they don't have the manpower to bring you out and even if you can go out err is very risky because later nanti anak dia orang datang complain eh why you let my mother my father go out ah ah you know
mak bapa dia orang yang like oh people who stay at their already they also frustrated they also want to go out okay imagine it's like you've been living your life up the whole life in a certain way out of sudden your place in this new environment lepas tu dia orang macam you want to
quote and be be scold or something also like that right pun tak boleh because apa
family members isn't that in singapore if we don't use it have enough resource kita tak ada banyak kebolehan untuk like build something from scratch start from ground zero we have no space and then it's like
our only resource kita punya apa kita ada is ah hasil kita is orang you know we only have people that I would like crops like that that we can export and import so that's why like
you know those uh I think last time your late aunty ah arwah tu dia duduk situ
you mean senior activities macam tu
but if you have to understand sebab kalau dia orang keluarkan I think banyak sangat orang nak literally like rental flats are never enough in singapore
but um apa
macam that time yang for hundred dollar COVID fund tu orang ambil advantage
tu lah
for like the elderly right is you in okay maybe not in singapore because I'm mean in singapore but why doubt popular another reason is orang dah tua orang nak pergi masjid nak pergi temple nak pergi church
you ada that club house especially as senior activity centre it doesn't appeal do you know that that clubhouse one session can facilitate up to thirty maximum sixty lah if the centre is really big
ya so it's like there are people who have to go every everyday because they are alone and very at risk tapi for those yang habis bad manpower is in low you know like if there's not enough space so macam
and not in the activities to appeal to everyone tak tak semua orang nak karaoke tak semua orang nak colour tak semua orang nak main mahjong ada orang nak pergi church nak pergi solat you know nak pergi prayer nak pergi temple so it's like
they should be away like for it to integrate um the spiritual part plus the active aging but it's just that dekat singapore is black kita neutral kan kita apa
um kita apa macam mana nak cakap apa tu yang
ah kita tak nak emphasize right that kind of thing you know and then
so because of that it is not about how I should say are very highly encouraging play a country to practice your religion first that if tapi kita kena buat moderately kita tak boleh over of course lah kita tak nak extremist kan kita nak be good to our neighbours
it every individual tahap um how religious they are tahap dia punya iman it's more like eat in the bowl
so bila you nak bawa orang orang ni cakap okay ah siapa nak pergi mall nak buat you know macam kalau let's say dia orang taruk rental flat like one of the benefit atau studio apartment eh what are the benefit is boleh buat pergi church temple and
um mosque mosque this mosque lepas tu ah church let's say is a catholic church then ah
but I didn't tinggalkan dia seorang seorang
so I I wanted that I'm not so keen but I'm not so sure about how it will pan out like because I'm not raised in the environment you know I'm raised in like nenek dekat rumah
um how to say ah macam nenek kat rumah so I am not the one that go out to seek my to accompany my elders my elders is the one that um my elders is the one that come ah
anything with me if with my family right so it's like you know that that the dynamic is already different dia punya um relationship is different so
macam mana nak cakap eh I I think it's not that I'm not keen maybe it's the fear of the unknown because I'm not used to it mah so it's like I'm I don't know how will it
um I feel sad also macam budak-budak kecil budak-budak secondary school yang macam dia orang nak duduk dekat rumah dalam bilik dia orang because they are because they are the oldest one
then dia orang nak kena sacrifice nak kena pergi rumah nenek
apa ah for those elder grandkids who have been tasked to take care of the grandparents to accompany I think um the parents should the parents themselves should naturally let it flow you know
oh semalam ada cakap kan the discussion dari kecil is what is important how you didik and show right um
kalau you tunjuk dia orang that oh you have to go you monday is usually is me feel like alamak this is a task this is a task
ah because once it becomes a task it becomes a chore nanti macam tak happy then ya but you know you can never know even though they are your kids they are still human beings you made me me like what they are actually very happy with the idea because for me it be like
why didn't you do lah bila kita nak kena pergi
ke apa kita tak nak pergi sebab apa oh cannot cannot I need to take care of my grandma if my friend ajak me go out nak keluar oh sorry sorry tak boleh tak boleh need to take care of my grandma you know like is it for me nenek dah kat rumah it convenient
ya it is a team effort macam mana dekat nursing home ada satu orang satu orang jer ada tiga orang
ya but so jadi ke masa cakap apalah kebaikan apalah sebaliknya jaga penjagaan like you all this tanya right dah tak cabaran lagi lah so it's just a learning experience
tadi mak cakap yang apa jaga nenek baru dapat tahu macam mana nak lain kali in the future macam mana mak nak dijaga don't you think that is the reward don't you think that is the syurga
is that you have to always selalu
be prepared to tukar mindset
tukar mindset
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh if metaphorically is if you put it in a
you can ah whatever makin turun makin turun kalau you tukar your you will say okay I'm trying to swim now okay swimming doesn't work okay let me take a path I let me do some breathing exercises that me just tried to float for a while you know
swimming you are trying to get to where you want to go you get a cramp in your leg and then there is like you know you patah balik patah balik right kadang-kadang like it can be like
it three weeks of peaceful snipping all of a sudden one day it is ah again ya and apa that sucks lah because
apa kita selalu um try our best too you oo kita nak beritahu mak kita jumpa kawan kita hari tu imagine eh kalau
and dia cakap lecturer dia is ah mak dia pun ada dementia she's the main caregiver lah okay you when even a lady who is teaching nursing who you would know is a pakar a professional in these right in having patience and kesabaran cause they take care kan
she also experiences ya she was experience caregiver stress that really affect her work so what my kawan bilang me was that
uh okay lah dia because dia ada background the towel the thick and jake's dump the limit jacket you should you hire professional you know they know what to do so her her tips and tricks is that the disrupt
the incident was um dia try her very very best untuk mak dia tak akan berak dan kencing anywhere
bila nak berak kan dan kencing I rasa dia ada strategi lah macam every one hour you bring every minute you bring you know that kind of thing she has already picked up the mothers are non-verbal cue err bila dia nak pergi berak nak pergi kencing dia cakap I try my very best I try so hard and it happen
siapa dia nak marah tu dia nak marah mak dia ke mak dia cannot help it kan dia nak marah diri dia ke dia ada choice all along ya so she like even like a I'm not sure whether nursing professionals or what lah but a professional who is teaching
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh ya like okay now I realise that even you doctor you nurse as you ni cuma you you also don't treat the patient twenty four seven
family yang dah ada history with that person and then like you they have a lot of emotional
attachment for nurses and practitioners they can always be like okay this is not working you try as so much with your client you try and like ask them work with then work with the family tapi kalau family do decide that one day
there is a professional boundary where you stop at like you will never go beyond it so like family there is no like is unconditional you selalu kena not not selalu kena actually you have to always be there what not what not
yet studied in that I guess especially in the asian society dementia is the terikut perangai lama jer perangai lamanya mana doktor tahu you know even like as much as you share with the doctor or my mother is like this like this like this
but doktor macam as much they are only able to do so much with the information you give tapi like I
think I had one someone I know right um dia punya mak dia tak nak makan kat rumah cakap makanan tu berpasir lah apalah a'ah macam tak suka kalau anak balik lagi so it's like instead of
sitting and eating that meal half an hour she takes four hours to finish that meal ah but did you know what actually what is the history is because she ya she stay in a different child's house now anak dia yang dulu duduk dengan dia ada dia ada bermampu lah
untuk bawa dia keluar makan tapi dementia makes you lose your ability to communicate right so dia tak tahu macam mana dia nak cakap yang dia nak makan kat luar
jadi cerita dia macam ni mm
dia cerita dia macam ni lah like
dementia is you can um jaga because you have heard stories fifteen years taking care but um it's your ability can you go through it or not and communicate they lose a lot of things they lose communication they lose their memory they lose their ability so
yup so it's very important to communicate with your family members because walaupun jaga dementia ke tak bila dah nak tua like mak cakap the blessing in all of this is that you know next time how you want to be taken care of macam mana mak nak dijaga jadi mak tahu mak nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak so bila nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak sekarang
because I started a business selling tahu begedil selling tahu begedil yes
basically because I like to eat tahu begedil
um quite recently eh ah like last month ah late last month when tahu begedil was was like a trend
um tahu begedil and they both
apa tu macam ada lah dia punya kesedapan tu kan ya
for a while because ibu force me to
but um making this tahu begedil of course I only started recently
um eh I mean there were no macam kedai taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
so I think ah this tahu begedil I will only sell bila ada time lah macam holidays
so maybe like maybe the next week is not tahu begedil it's like
oh I didn't call I didn't name it but ibu and abang named it as
bawal yes tudung bawal you know there's square scarf
um one is the our cotton bawal and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk bawal and our cotton bawal it sells
kita suka try benda like try to do things new things and we try to ya lah
we hustle a lot macam tak kesah ah kalau hari-hari kerja
asalkan like kita boleh rasa duit tu ah
ah inshallah wah untuk ah benda yang halal
oh like mati macam melayu
apa tu open casting for new models
like tak suka ambil gambar and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a hijabi model
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't simpan because the quality is like shit
and then I come back with just a piece of tudung for me it's like merepek so
ibu um
apa ni um shops coming to you uh for shooting she said then okay lah I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
people also come to me um to do to create apa to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
I don't know whatever barang that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried uh an influencer before to boost start my um Kamash um the tudung brand
apa tu our
to the company first let them approve apa-apa macam if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people ah macam tambah-tambah lah ah themselves and then they
then they send back to us then baru kita copy paste and then put
selling clothes selling muslimah clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
macam ah you need to do your research err do survey do prototype everything
um sellers terdahulu biasa about apa yang dorang suka instead of what
you get what I mean macam they
assume that orh aku suka ni so confirm orang lain akan suka
pasal um a lot of people say eh ni lawa confirm ada orang suka confirm ada orang suka but we cannot hear what our family members really um say we need to reach out to people
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum ah she said like orh ni colour cantik everything whatever shit
but then actually salah ah it's not selling our first
simple macam not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful tapi a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like eh eh ni mana ada orang pakai cotton lagi kan panas kan panas but it sell out like a lot um we bought I'm ten colours
bila dah membesar right sambil membesar
ya sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar tau apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then ibu tak suka so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
um she said oh you know um macam she tell told me all the negative things lah all the
it's like jaga mayat jaga mayat and then like
but of course ibu also tak kasi because she say I will mati cepat the I'm like kalau ajal tu ada mati lah I mean like we cannot
macam mana nak cakap eh like
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what ibu wants me to do lah
is the hantu remember
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little masih kecil kan that time
uh apa tu um aku rugi lah mm mm
obviously tahu begedil I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like oh I need to to control myself because
dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil kan
tak okay aku tak boleh tak makan but if I can
apa seh
even if people bila
silat ya but then we stop because like um
the penjuru is it the guru the head of the silat or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he campur with
benda tak elok lah um with
jin yes
no sister his sister yang ini kat luar I it was at sengkang it was at sengkang you know those macam got court badminton court ya we silat there
one point of time macam tengah buat benda sendiri ah and then like
tapi like I saw this guru and this student like a teenage student
um tengah terbaring tau
the guru is like macam gitu macam baca-baca then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like um like what macam dia sakit ke I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person rasuk lah katakan
one of our uncle also was in the same silat with us siapa tu ah ariff ah he quitted first and then we quit
I feel like is a traditional err okay um one thing I learned about silat while doing my research for my last time was
the their silat is actually
a'ah tekan
like how to say um okay selalunya sekarang orang kat luar kan dorang gaduh kan dia rembat jer tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu when they are in a battle
um they tunjuk respect to one another first and they you know buka bunga is where you show like oh are you ready
to silat then ya
ya macam gitu lah

okay um I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya shopping ke I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya work ke nak dengar pasal kak alin punya wedding
tapi one of the macam
tapi no lah I mean I'll get a shelf for it or something lah for my bags or something
because I remember reading before dia orang kata can just keep
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips dekat dia orang punya zips covered kan in in like its original packaging kita tak buka so it's all just there abeh kita takut ah okay so I thought was safe
abeh I followed his wife macam a luxury person lah okay on instagram abeh dia ada macam Q&A session gitu sometimes abeh dia punya one of dia punya itu is um don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime abeh if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then um the humidity and also whatever whatever
ya so so I'm worried about it tapi kalau if I ask him to keluarkan
then tak oh my god tapi that time itu saya tengah because saya beli banyak benda kan then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because kakak dia belum keluarkan her clothes
so in that so ada a small section where I can put the stuff lah abeh
you know bila macam nak unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag ah macam all nice gitu kan so woohoo open it up
then tak enough space tau so long as it can I can you gerakkan your tempat baju sikit so that I can more space lepas itu dia how why you just taruh dekat atas lah then no nanti crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is kalau kak suruh dia like can you keluarkan this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
nanti dia just macam campak or whatever nanti semua like I don't know nanti macam crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why macam oh if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now kak punya kerja like
just nak duduk rumah ya
um because now dia apple boy he got a macbook
then when your contract ends kita sama tak mine is on february
tapi yours is the same kita sama plan kan ada abah
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think dia punya pun end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone ah
ya then macam all the other laptops macam will
ah then macam not bad ah then like ya macam
macam all the food that abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai seh
then dia okay lah then dia ya
no I just thought macam
I tak tahu I tahu macam when I hear macam the oh the android versus apple whatever macam android punya argument macam their specs is better
and like sea creams like sea cream pastels and dia macam you know that marshmallow and macam round gitu swirly gitu it literally looks at that considering the pathway is not
ah macam film theory
kan film theory on youtube kau dah tengok I feel like ada
I tak tahu fashion so back to the basic
ya cause I tak adventurous so saya tak adventurous
saya takut stick out
okay saya tak tahu ring so
the vibes eh the vibes get a little vaccine also hello it's just it's just tampal there anyway
aku tak tahu period aesthetic tau aesthetic kita tak ada the third eye aesthetic close
kita tak ada vibes kak ada I would say um FOMO
ah ah macam oh she looks nice let me copy that look
I have macam oh okay I like this I don't like that outfit ada lah but macam
it's not like oh I the whole genre of that outfit I suka
ya lah academia lah macam sweater um with like pleats and like straight cut pants
you know kak benda semua dekat my table black and pink
oh so kak limah macam on that scale kak limah macam on a six
I'm fine with that tapi dia end up with um macam best so been tested
um he's kinda like dia just not a nice guy
I don't remember if dia ada err actually I do I don't remember if dia ada err apa macam character change plot whatever what is it called ya character development I don't remember
ya macam huh asal dia ini ya actually all the guys in gossip girl boo humphrey boo they just macam oh oh it's me okay I don't fit in macam okay relax
zero number first affordable need archie bol something like that okay I get it macam kau kaya okay archipelago I teller I david archuleta
weird but no archuleta is doesn't he doesn't even sound macam atas
archie bol dia how to spell archie B O L oh
he's like in the upper class you know cause ya tak humphrey macam humpty dumpty you know he's in the dumps period serena serena van der would said okay she has she has european blood line okay
I mean I'm sure macam small characters lah but the main cast their white
dia macam oh my god brooklyn dekat a part of new york
so macam school high school ya dekat ya the show started dia orang high school that means it's high school season so by the time case dia orang dah kerja dia orang dah kerja some of them kahwin so
dah kahwin dah ah si chuck bass kahwin si blair waldorf si selena kahwin si dan ah I tahu dan lah he main the netflix you know the you the stalker that's dan and then selena is siapa nama selena eh
blake lively selena william selena wiliam sejak bila nak sama tak oh tersay then blair waldorf selena booked dia the waldorf brown hair ah siapa
there's two the main character I would say two girls and three guys two girls three guys ther's one more girl tapi dia macam I think
I was like tak salah lah at the end dia macam
um I at the actress some something and then dia macam tak so so present either like ending last season something like that the actress herself macam problematic something like like that lah dia macam dia macam indecisive punk life then dia macam I think so lah there were some like drama whatever contract tak ingat ah something something but
kalau if I remember correctly she wasn't macam so
I tak tahu I tak tahu dia nak pursue music something like that she had a rock band and that no she's blonde she's like super like platinum blonde and tapi dia ada pakai like eyeliner macam wow macam black the character also not nice
towards the end agaknya lah ya
anyway dia dan punya adik in the show
so there's three guys and then ya I think the two guys if I say the name you don't know who ya because dia orang after gossip girl dia orang tak so popular
no itu
skaters pretty liars ah no pretty liars tak ada boys actually ada boys but dia orang macam not
maybe I don't even know what the guys look like ada ada boys but dia orang macam not so
aria aria the rambut macam besar gila kan

nina hate wall E actually kau dah tengok the first thirty minutes I watch the
E wall oh I tak tahu lah mana aku tahu E wall iya
and lastly err the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world sebab bila you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good ah when you can do things yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat
mm pasal ilmu ni but dia ada banyak err rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi hmm kalau dapat ni best ah pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat mm and bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni mm
so ini adalah yang tiga wishes yang saya nak mm so kita err what about you fathul
pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh spend on whatever and what not and bila awak dapat spend whatever and what not then means err with every spending awak akan rasa this happiness
kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang teleport ke tempat lain so dia jadi the source of this err kuman lah so dia yang spread to others
dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus mm so I stay over this view whereby teleportation could actually increase
okay mungkin awak dah cakap ini okay maybe saya agree sikit
maybe awak ada point over there
tapi yang contact tracing tu mungkin tak tak senangkan lah
pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia teleport kalau dia sendiri dah suka teleport
mm tapi ini interesting point of view mm so kalau awak tanya saya apa superpower yang saya nak saya nak power of regeneration
so contohnya err jari saya terpotong ah nanti dia akan heal sendiri
saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki dislocate ah dia regenerate sendiri
dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak kan nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang high risk
itu meminta kematian lah
think of living in isolation uh maybe one maybe satu hari bila dah dah experienced everything yang kita nak ah
okay mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya and betul lah yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena
sebab tanpa kita bergaul dengan orang we will never know what they face
so for example bila kita tahu orang ini menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong so kita akan mencari solution untuk menolong seseorang itu
so mungkin apa awak cakap err betul juga ah and tapi bila awak err saya
hmm hairan lah kenapa awak err question bila seseorang itu nak isolate maybe for months
his child behind then anak-anak dia akan merana ah and
kalau months okay months maybe saya rasa maksimum err maybe not more than nine months ah
lesser than that mungkin okay
kenapa nine months sebab within this nine months um budak tu dia akan grow and after this nine months
okay soalan tu interesting sepuluh tahun means sebelas tahun yang lalu
sebelas tahun yang lalu okay saya definitely akan suruh diri saya err ini ah invest ah invest in bitcoin
sebab at umur ten years old memang awak cakap betul uh nak nak faham tentang certain barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat convince ah
satu orang ni at ten years old dia akan ingat
and maybe along the way mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas and then dia akan start
err thinking back err apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak
ah adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya ten years bila saya ten-year-old akan betul
so mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan err um akan interest awak ah pasal maybe one day juga awak akan jadi famous because of this ah
err some luck you managed to stay alive ah so for you err apa yang experience awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian
I need to add on apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati
it happens whereby we have to train where err train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so kita orang kena capsize habis tu bila capsize ini kita kena grab kawan kita punya kayak
and get back up ah so bila saya tengah practice capsize ini
instructor jauh so kita jauh daripada semua orang
habis tu kita bila saya tengah capsize kawan saya dia lose control of dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah capsize terus saya tap saya punya kayak
bila saya tengok terbalik ini so kawan saya punya bot tak ada
saya dekat situ saya stuck ah saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada skirt skirt ini akan prevent water from entering our kayak
nak keluarkan skirt tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh so saya tap kuat-kuat
tap kuat-kuat uh in hope that kawan saya dengar saya ah pasal saya tengah dekat
dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia so saya tap tap tap dia tak dengar alright bila dia dengar ini dia kata ah lepas incident dia cuba paddle tapi I tolak dia so dia nak paddle susah sikit
so saya dekat bawah air maybe for one minute ah
but I was skateboarding and dalam mimpi tu saya rasa best nak bila skateboard ni rasa seronok jer and
bila skateboard tu dah mimpi itu bila saya bangun oh eh rasa macam apa ni macam nak nak skateboard ah ah dari situlah saya start
start skateboard tapi nak belajar skateboard ni dia susah sangat err it's actually very difficult to learn skateboard because there's a lot of
and bila dapat tahan breath saya lama begitu saya nak start nak belajar uh free dive and that time bila kat swimming pool uh saya ada swimming dekat nine metre pool ah ah itu saya cuba
and dapat lah dapat sampai ke bottom tapi I was having difficulty breathing ah and to control my breath is actually difficult so those are the ambitions that I have
oh sekejap jer kan rasa dah dua ribu dua puluh satu dah
kan dia macam january february march december terus
tu ah
target berapa target
wow eh tapi kan khairul aming buat kan fifteen dua bulan tau ah tak dia memang dia memang makan sihat eat clean and he did skipping like for every day
ah but memang kak long vegetarian kot of course you can do it
mm menarik menarik
of course I have a lot tapi kita kena prioritise lah kan mana yang for this year and nanti next next year kita buat lagi yang lain kan
okay before this rasa boleh survive lima ratus sebulan sekarang gaji pun tak cukup untuk survive bulan-bulan so plan resolution untuk dua ribu dua puluh satu adalah untuk
mm make my own business uh untuk for side income lah part time lah part time for fun
mm ada two things actually which is dah started dah pun ah macam tu tapi kita
kita slow slow lah menapak kita punya business kan first uh untuk buat surprise delivery
sebenarnya kan nak buat surprise delivery ni I tak rasa pun nak buat
dia bukannya more to untuk duit tau it is just that I feel happy to see people happy
faham ke ha macam pergi delivery pergi pergi buat delivery kat orang nanti orang tu surprise eh dapat happy dapat surprise gitu kan macam seronoknya macam tu lah lagi satu the
the other part yang best sebab selepas delivery ini adalah bila kita
pack surprise tu kan so kalau orang tu order nak ni ni ni kita pack dia punya surprise box tu kan bila pack tu rasa macam
uh we pour love in that box faham ke
boleh customise lah sebab kita tak nak macam idea macam mana eh kita nak every gift tu comes with thought
orang tu sendiri fikir dia nak bagi hadiah apa bukannya dia dia bagi bulat-bulat kat kita oh okay uh I nak set A dah let's say macam tu kan which is set A dia memang kita dah provide
then it dia macam tak comes from heart truly tau ha
ha kita macam gift creator lah macam tu
everything is possible apa jer orang tu nak kita akan make it happen kan
end of november tahun lepas kot start
ah ada dua customer and more to come
hmm betul
then satu bila macam selalunya kita surprise delivery orang yang order surprise delivery ni orang yang tak boleh nak pergi hantar sendiri
so dia part oh part yang orang tu pergi hantar part tu dah tak ada tau untuk orang tu bagi dekat but macam nice ah kita nak bagi kat orang kan
so part yang kita pergi hantar barang tu dah tak ada which is dalam surprise tu satu part tu dah tak ada kita tolong buatkan that's why customisation tu penting maksudnya orang yang nak bagi hadiah tu
dia memang gift put in thoughts dalam apa yang dia nak bagi orang tu walaupun dia tak boleh hantar sendiri tapi thoughts tu ada ah
a'ah dia bukan the for the sake of just giving but giving with means lah macam tu
nama dia kotak riang okay boleh search kat Instagram pada kotak riang okay
yes that's right tu satu second is
err ni macam baru jer start like semalam first of january err a'ah but err this one
tak tak tak buat sendiri lah just drop ship barang orang lah kan err nak jual healthy food
uh dia uh makanan-makanan yang orang yang nak diet orang yang nak sihat cari faham ke
dia sugar free punya products ah
ah betul macam apa konjac mee tu kan
yes yes ada ada err antara barang yang angah drop ship
yang no sugar
but it taste like the real peanut butter ada peanut butter ada almond butter chocolate yang macam Nutella pun ada
but semua yup sugar free
okay so next next ada resolution ada
I think that's good and actually cakap pasal nak
betul and it's not something wrong pun
betul and it give benefits to other people as well
betul kita pun Google dulu
mmhmm kan selain daripada save money maybe you can gain some money as well mm mm
yes dah it's two thousand and twenty one healthy and rich
ya as in dia kan dia macam ni tau err plot twist dia maksudnya ya I have everything in plan but I want all my plan to be plot twisted in a good way maybe I have I have expectation at eighty percent maybe
ah ada ada
entah lah resolution ni
main sukan lah berdebat lah apa semua kan so it was very interesting life
interesting as well because I have my own money kan very interesting tapi
come back at home like for six and then at ten dah kelat sebab penat and that is very non healthy lifestyle for me lah so in twenty twenty one my resolution is to have
no no that's not the I want some me time yang can benefit myself as well bukan macam me time just leisure time lepak-lepak tak ada tak ada
a'ah betul dulu ingatkan abah kan main guitar kan then semua anak-anak abah ni kan angah sorang jer yang
ada keinginan nak main guitar kecil-kecil dulu kan
so I yes darjah darjah enam kat kedah dulu
mm menarik a'ah betul
mmhmm ye betul
ya uh huh tu clarinet clarinet tu ni lah ah betul lah squidward
something yang dah ada base eh
ada satu yang angah teringin nak err enroll in mandarin class a'ah I don't know ah I think I really I really have strong interest in language
betul lah I I really learn to love new language I think mandarin err is my choice right now because
apa dia a'ah
ah tengok
mm betul tiba-tiba dah berjaya
and one more thing I think macam macam kak long kata lah belum kaya lagi kan but in the process in the journey sepanjang-panjang nak jadi kaya tu
you actually contribute a lot to the society mm from the the fundraising that you made or daripada the job that you created for other people
you know those small small things actually walaupun tak kaya but it means a lot kan
mm betul
mmhmm betul
what is your advice for a startup macam angah
tapi cakap pasal start up tadi kan sampai sekarang tak puas hati lagi tau
han ji pyeong patut jadi hero
mmhmm betul
pasal dia dah bring the character tu
a'ah betul
betul lah tu tapi nam do san tu hais geram jer lah tengok
um ni macam very small small small thing tapi important lah
tak nak procrastinate ah
kan sebab itu lah punca kepada segala-galanya dua puluh dua puluh tak jadi faham ke kita bertangguh tangguh tangguh tangguh ha hapo pun takde
betul err and I agree that sometimes when we procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better faham ke macam like very last minute tapi it push us to to make a better thing faham ke ya that's true but
when it comes to working the the the that is quite hard lah actually faham ke sebab ya maybe maybe
so tahu lah kita ada deadline kan deadline is twentieth october lah konon kan but the boss want to see the progress bukannya on twenty nine tu I can do everything faham ke
yes betul
hmm tapi susah lah
the the algorithm dia mmhmm
a'ah eh tapi kadang-kadang kan bukan kita sebut tau benda kita fikir pun macam keluar juga
pelik kan angah rasa dia tanam chip lah
mm sometimes benda yang kak nor cakap dengan umi pun macam nak beli apa-apa benda tu keluar dekat angah ha
ya entah entah camera ni so scary
tapi kita pun sedar jer kan like the like kita punya that time ada yang kelat
memang terus scroll bawah sekali tick
internet internet ni they works in a very interesting way
live okay lagi ni some people err even make like house tour kot
I think I think that is very something that unacceptable to me lah maybe others think that it's for fun but for me it's like you are showing to people how to enter your house faham ke
dah lah mostly yang buat tu semua wealthy people
ah faham
but I think kan angah pernah dengar satu video ni
err actually kita boleh set for err ni for iPhone users lah kita boleh set set for one day how many hours that we spend ah bila kita dah exceed kan dia akan keluar notification that you have exceed the the total hours of err social media or something like that lah for today
hmm boleh boleh set dekat phone I think we can also keep track lah on that day how many how many time on the day how many time how many hours
ya we we are adults takkan nak ada parental control lagi
a'ah oh ye ah
eh seronok lah
eh orang nak tengok nak try ah
menarik ah
kan I think that this is how we would faham ke
kita akan more determined
if we can see what is the result faham ke kalau kita macam okay four hours nak concentrate kita tak dapat sebab kita tak nampak apa-apa kita tak boleh nak materialise benda tu tau
ha oh walaupun apps yang acknowledge pun it's enough
betul betul betul betul kan kita manusia memang mcam tu ah
ah apa dia
oi menarik
kadang-kadang kita nak tengok waktu pukul berapa sekali a'ah lepas a'ah betul
betul yes
that's correct anyway cakap pasal kucing tadi dah entah lah kucing ni kan diorang ni macam addictive eh
ya ikut suka hati dia
ya betul tak tak tahu lah kita bela kucing untuk apa sebenarnya
tak ada hati kan kadang-kadang kan kan kalau kita adopt kucing kan macam kita pergi adopt kucing kan tapi kan macam orang kata
it is not you who choose the cat the cat choose you faham ke
dah lah diorang selalu buat dumb things tapi kita still bela bagi makan
but they pee everywhere kenapa elegant
huh dia kan tidur terkangkang tengok kucing-kucing kita
that is very interesting kadang-kadang kan teringat kucing ni pun boleh gelak sendiri tau
angah terfikir satu benda but it's very random lah tapi something that angah memang selalu terfikir lah bayangkan lah kan kalau tiba-tiba
ada zombie apocalypse apa kita akan buat
tak sebenarnya kan zombie ni boleh jadi ke
ya betul
ah kat rumah a'ah
eh I think angah pernah sembang dengan kak long ke siapa dulu ke it is only my imagination but I think we have plan before that we want to sell zombie survival kit pernah tak kita ke itu imaginasi angah ada
uh huh macam cukup makan cukup first aid ah kan
oh it's not specifically for zombie lah tak beli ke a'ah
war ke mm mm
tapi kan cakap pasal bunker tadi angah terfikir lah kalau kalau kita buat rumah kan kita hire contractor
then the contractor will know everything about our house isn't that dangerous ke sometimes I would think that way lah macam okay kalau kita buat secret room then the contractor tu akan tahu secret room kita kat mana what if the contractor have bad intention
ah lepas tu ah faham aduhai
oh back to cat conversation cakap pasal cat ni kan diorang addictive
eh kalau kita pindah rumah baru kan I really want to build a catio for our cats
mm betul
ah that's what I was thinking about catio tu dekat hujung sekali depan tu swimming pool
so when we were swimming kita boleh hi kucing macam tu
and and sometimes I feel like I want them to swim with us as well boleh ke kucing boleh berenang ke
oh comelnya kalau kucing berenang
oh ye ke
steady boleh berenang ah
macam glasshouse lah kan cantiknya
and itu lah kita punya permulaan kepada segala-galanya tak ada harapan tak ada
perancangan so tak ada apa-apa kan takkan tiba-tiba terjadi selain ada pelan kan
siapa ramai tak percaya time tu
mm mm betul
cakap pasal cross country kan
kesian kan tengok ramai stewardess steward pilot yang laid off sekarang
mmhmm memang tak boleh langsung boleh lah but a few flights jer yang boleh pun sekarang
tapi tapi tapi pasal steward and stewardess ni kan ada cadangan untuk bawa
err steward and stewardess jadi macam helper lah ataupun additional staff dekat poly lah sebab diorang ada basic first aid punya basic ha
a'ah betul
kan a'ah sebab dia memang ada basic
betul mmhmm
pastu kebanyakan yang kena sack yang kena laid off
pun akan start business akan start buat business
because that's the fastest way untuk kita do something instead of waiting for jobs to come to you
employer pun tak semestinya nak ambil kerja dalam waktu sekarang
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul
social yup betul betul
actually kan kalau tengok macam junior junior pun kan ada pun ramai yang
ya betul satu err satu sebab
jarang lah kita buat assignment sorang-sorang waktu dulu pun mesti discuss dengan kawan-kawan share jawapan like very very normal things to do kan tu satu second
our youth feeling faham ke
mm betul
ya lepas tu dah habis online learning
tiba-tiba graduate online then terus masuk kerja
then you will you ya we have to face a very hard life waktu kerja without your friends anymore
mmhmm experience pula
I think dekat china err they even built a academy for influencer kat china korea takyah cakap lah korea memang
itu memang like being famous is like
most of their punya ambitions lah ya being famous become actors actress dengan idol idol
tu lah tapi
budak-budak muda sekarang memang look up to
because artist ni orang akan minat dia sebab character yang dia bawa dalam drama character dia bawa dalam movie but influencer ni orang minat dia apa atas apa hidup dia faham ke so that's why people lagi look up to influencer daripada
mmhmm betul
eh apa kak long punya macam
for our family lah kan apa kak long punya resolution
mm dan angah rasa sejak kan sejak kita punya ni movement order ni angah rasa kita pun memang banya spend time
mm together sebagai satu family
I think same quite the same things juga lah
I want all of us to be involved together in everything that we do faham ke yes macam
main dengan kucing memasak ke
a'ah betul cantik-cantik
they can remind us satu lagi satu we want mm make them
we want we want to prove that we can do it to them faham ke macam angah cakap dengan kak long gini kan mesti angah rasa macam kena tunjuk ni boleh buat ah ah takkan cakap kosong jer
