or less than two hours <malay>dah habis</malay> [ah] edit
(uh) <malay>tadi</malay> I <malay>berbual dengan</malay> my
my russian teacher <malay>tu</malay> the skype over skype [eh]
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was (err) he was a having a conversation with his friends our (uh) what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me <malay>yang</malay>
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
I and the song was from #tokyo# square then she's like #tokyo# square so he thought that <malay>dia dari jepun ke</malay> group <malay>ni</malay> then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean [lah] it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was (uh)
(err) who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like [eh] that's not the famous song from #tokyo# square
but the song actually nice <malay>tapi dia pakai lagu</malay> #sukiyaki# <malay>punya lagu</malay> [tau] do you know #sukiyaki# right there's this
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the #tokyo# square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it [ah]
(uh) it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow <malay>kak tina</malay> to this concert by #tokyo# square
so #tokyo# square actually that
it's not a a got a #tokyo# square concert but they perform a few songs [ah]
(uh) because there are many other things that (err) at that show so #tokyo# square was one of them so I I I remember #tokyo# square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word #tokyo# slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
(uh) that is the originally is from #tokyo# square but there's some (uh) famous <malay>mat salleh</malay> singers sing that song [lah] western singers that (err) sing (err) #tokyo# square <malay>punya lagu</malay> but that is I say <malay>macam</malay> singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
to america right they don't have
a lot of talent [lah] they don't <malay>macam</malay> you know
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is #sukiyaki# [ah] from what I know
(uh) but <malay>dia punya</malay> melody has been reused and reused by other bands [lah] but that is not the most famous #tokyo# square
(uh) because like I mean <malay>nama</malay> #tokyo# square <malay>tapi dari</malay> singapore you know <malay>macam</malay>
that's the that's the unique thing [lah] that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin> I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin> I need you
because my I think <malay>kak tina</malay> did some events [ah] for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
put us somewhere then she brought me with her [lah] so I think one of that that's why she know #tokyo# square
(uh)
and that they were performing <malay>dekat mana</malay> [tau] <malay>kat depan</malay> if I am not wrong [eh] at this <malay>padang</malay> area near parkway parade
they had this show they had this
no <malay>macam</malay> this area <malay>dekat depan</malay> parkway <malay>ke sebelah kat</malay> parkway <malay>ke</malay> one of those area [lah] because parkway was you it was like a famous [lah] you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center <malay>dekat</malay> eighties nineties <malay>mana ada banyak</malay>
[ah] so you remember [lah]
(mm)
(uh) the open space then they put up (err) the stage right [eh] (um) but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like [what]
(uh)
sam willows
I think <malay>kalau mungkin mungkin yang</malay> singapore <malay>yang</malay> rock band [lah] <malay>yang dulu-dulu</malay> [ah]
[ah] the malay rock band #ramli sarip# all that there is known <malay>tapi</malay> for the english
medium [eh] english medium <malay>tak banyak</malay> that's why #tokyo# squares is one of <malay>tapi yang</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> sam willows <malay>sekarang</malay> famous there were a few [ah]
(uh)
is there a song baby jane [eh]
(uh)
four

ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese (err) medium right like the malay medium
(err) have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
(uh) on the side line [lah] it's like the a full time job for them

he was able to
like they say <malay>kembangkan dia punya</malay> talent [ah]
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous [what]
ya
[ah] ya the malay medium [lah] but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like #kit chan#
you know <malay>macam yang ada</malay> english the (err) english medium <malay>ada</malay> but they are not
they are not world famous [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the their world famous because they perform

astro [eh]
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this (err)
[ah] not really talent train [lah] it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market <malay>macam kira</malay> malaysia <malay>ada</malay> market you know
<malay>macam nak cakap pasal</malay> comedian <malay>ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar</malay> comedian <malay>pun</malay> comedian <malay>macam</malay> (err) #suhaimi# [eh] #suhaimi# part time you know at least <malay>dia dia</malay> part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
<malay>jadi macam</malay>

singapore the the [ah] they're not very good with improvisation <malay>tak bagus</malay>
[ah] I I I understand <malay>macam boboi boboi punya</malay> jokes [eh] #boboi# the group the maharaja lawak</malay> [eh] [kan] they have #boboi# they have the different
[ah] what is that either let like either when they talk about <malay>loghat</malay> [eh] there's always a <malay>tema tema</malay> like like <malay>loghat</malay> like is always going to be malaysia <malay>menang</malay> because singapore <malay>tak pandai buat loghat</malay> you know
it's only people like [ah] #zizan# #zizan# [eh]
they can really do <malay>loghat</malay> know and they really are very good at imitating <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya macam</malay> they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know <malay>macam</malay> malaysia really <malay>bercakap loghat loghat</malay> is accent right <malay>kira loghat orang</malay> #kedah# <malay>orang</malay> #kelantan# and then
they are more exposure ya
<malay>kita punya loghat</malay> is <malay>loghat bahasa baku</malay>
no no but they are very professional I remember I <malay>pergi</malay> (err) the not <malay>kedung kodek</malay> what's that
the theater [lah] that the malaysia that we went to to watch the #nadrah# right
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching <malay>pi mai pi mai tang tu</malay> at that time was #imuda# #imuda# that there were some people <malay>sayang</malay> they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform !ee! <malay>apa tu</malay> they can really perform <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat masa yang berpanjangan</malay> [tau] <malay>macam ada</malay> stamina is really that <malay>atau buat orang macam orang pergi</malay> #kelantan# #kelantan# they they the people doing <malay>dikir barat</malay>
they can really do <malay>dikir barat</malay> the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs [lah]
I remember when M #nasir# was talking to a
(err) #hady# [eh] #hady mirza#
for the
(err) what's the talent show [eh]
the <malay>yang yang lama-lama</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia kata orang</malay> glamour <malay>ada</malay> what is that [ah]
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia <malay>dia</malay> perform astro <malay>punya</malay> [lah]
I think astro <malay>punya</malay> organise so ya guest judge was
(err) M #nasir# so (err) #hady mirza# because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube [lah] I I I I watched through
[ah] <malay>tapi dia ada</malay> all the the veteran singer so #hady# was face off with this other
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose [lah]
[ah] so they have this person in the end <malay>dia menang dua-dua</malay> two of them <malay>memang</malay> [kan]
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think (err) (err) M #nasir# asked him (err) #hady# where have you been
why now you know <malay>macam</malay> like in a way <malay>kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat</malay> malaysia you know
because he was (err) wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work (err)
ya <malay>pasal dia dah</malay> then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really <malay>menyanyi</malay> is really his talent you know
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem [eh]
no but <malay>macam</malay> I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series [eh]
like zoe #tay# and that time zoe #tay# was the were the in she was really the talent like #pan ling ling#
junior [eh] #yuan ching# you <malay>tahu</malay> you <malay>kenal dia</malay> was she some
ya zoe #tay# was from your <malay>ni</malay>
#yuan ching# #yuan ching# <malay>yang dekat</malay> #jurong# [eh]
[oh]
her association
no but but you had that #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni is it #yuan ching#
#yuan ching# <malay>macam hancing</malay> the the #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni dinner right you [eh]
no I said if you want to go you can go with
<malay>siapa tu</malay>
(err) your friends <malay>apa ashik</malay> [eh] <malay>siapa</malay>
#amin# [kan] <malay>dia orang tak pergi</malay> [eh]
I told you the three of you form a table [what] with your other friends and <malay>sama kelas</malay>
no at that time [lah]
now <malay>memang susah</malay>
[ah]
pass away already [eh]
pass away [eh]
retired [lah]
<malay>cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar</malay> [jer]
how does it look like
is it <malay>badan besar rambut putih</malay> [eh]
[oh]
pointed out [ah]
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
ya <malay>macam macam macam seroja</malay> was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
you know to be ya I mean be (err) get get new more books you know but <malay>macam</malay> the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just <malay>macam seroja</malay>
she's just tired you know
and (um)
I think that's the main reason why they retire
[eh] even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine [oh] for you you are millennial I'm not [sia]
you you are I'm not I'm older than you <malay>sayang</malay>
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
(uh) I am a generation X [leh]
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>si si siapa</malay> was telling me these millennials [ah] because it's
it's really the you [lah] but you are not the the the the people that #seroja# and #borshak# was saying [lah]
the they were saying that this millennials [ah] lazy you know lazy [ah]
ya
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right <malay>mana tengok seroja</malay> I <malay>tengok kesian</malay> [ah]
[ah]
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
<malay>dia beli rumah tu</malay> about <malay>satu</malay> point <malay>satu satu</malay> point <malay>dua juta</malay> [tau]
no she said people the
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to (uh) buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house <malay>pun</malay> (err)
(uh) it's slow down <malay>macam orang pun tak nak beli</malay>
so
<malay>rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu</malay> I think
I think ten years [eh] twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even (err) make any profit
(err) around the same price as #seroja#
(uh) (uh)
(uh) <malay>dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual</malay>
<malay>dia tak nak jual</malay>
(uh)
<malay>macam tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak jual harga tinggi</malay> [lah] she just want to sell (uh)
slightly more [lah] or around the same price [lah]
because she already bought a she already got (err) her flat
(err) her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
<malay>dia punya rumah yang ini tingkat dua yang rumah ke sana tu tingkat lapan</malay>
she want to because she love (err) cycling
[ah] and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle <malay>dekat</malay>
her condo <malay>tu</malay> [kan] not near the beach right so <malay>macam</malay>
to her is an effort [lah] to go back and forth <malay>naik basikal di situ</malay> and I think a bit #ulu# [lah] because <malay>situ</malay> [kan] <malay>jauh</malay> [kan]
she like cycling but <malay>macam</malay>
I think she wants to cycle near the beach [lah] she doesn't have to
(uh)
ya [lah] but she has wonderful legs [ah]
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but <malay>macam</malay>
for me when I see her I <malay>tengok</malay> I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
<malay>macam</malay> is typical of (err) they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
<malay>macam</malay> still <malay>tinggal</malay> that <malay>rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual</malay> and still have (err) her she's start to pay ready for her house
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around (uh) ten years or so [ah]
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road [eh]
the amber road I'm not sure maybe [ah]
I think I I don't think is a new condo [ah]
(uh) (uh)
no no hers was second hers was a new <malay>lepas tu dia kata</malay> <malay>ada</malay>
(uh) it's new it's new
[ah] <malay>tapi besar</malay> because <malay>rumah dia belum habis</malay> renovate [eh] because they had to for stall the
(uh)
(uh) the no the the <malay>macam kira</malay> development <malay>dah habis semua tapi orang semua</malay> I think they <malay>nak</malay> renovate [ah] <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi pasal</malay> renovation <malay>kena</malay> put on hold because of the COVID
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
so I was thinking to myself [oh] not bad [eh] <malay>dia tak payah jual rumah</malay> in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to <malay>jual rumah</malay> so <malay>maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta</malay> I mean she's already <malay>nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu</malay> and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
and not having to borrow money from the bank
maybe she has the money <malay>ada duit juga</malay> [ah]
that one <malay>betul-betul ada</malay> (err) pool or view of the pool ya
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
<malay>tiga tiga</malay> bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice <malay>sayang</malay> it was like
[oh] my god sex heaven
(uh) I think I think for <malay>dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal</malay> condo she shared with a flatmates <malay>dulu dia tinggal dekat</malay> <malay>sekarang dia tinggal kat</malay> condo I think she found a new flatmate [eh] and then <malay>macam kat kat</malay> russia [kan] they don't have this quality of
condo [kan]
(uh) so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware [lah] about the development about about buying condo (uh) that #dasha# is aware so <malay>macam macam</malay> it's very sexy [lah]
it's very very nice
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because <malay>dekat itu dekat dengan</malay> russian <malay>nya</malay> embassy
and and then <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit timah# <malay>dia nak dekat dengan</malay> nature <malay>agaknya orang putih gitu</malay> [kan]
[ah] shared <malay>dengan ramai ramai ramai</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I never ask
(uh)
because I thought I I thought she stayed at #serangoon# garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
(uh) (uh)
(uh) but I think she like the location <malay>agaknya</malay>
<malay>dekat dengan rumah dekat dengan dekat kerja agaknya</malay>
(uh) because this <malay>mat salleh</malay> they like their nature they like
(uh) <malay>dia naik</malay> bus <malay>dia dia orang naik</malay> bus
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
because maybe the flatmate <malay>yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya</malay>
!huh!
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask [lah]
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
they're not really <malay>macam kita</malay> a bit rude about money we talk about money like <malay>macam</malay> I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think #dasha# will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about <malay>macam</malay>
especially french so I think it's something that they
<malay>macam</malay> it's not really the thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> us <malay>cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual</malay>
(uh)
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very (err) thrifty [lah] [sia]
you <malay>tahu</malay> this this year I don't see her spending anything <malay>dia tak beli baju baru</malay>
rent [eh]
(uh)
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
(mm)
<malay>mungkin dengan</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia ke apa kita tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>mungkin ada</malay> boyfriend [lah]
that's why she move (uh)
<malay>kalau</malay> like that okay [eh]
make sense right
(uh) but #sami# <malay>suka</malay>
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam dia dia kata dia ada</malay> swimming pool <malay>kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna</malay> [kan] (uh) that's fixed to me condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam</malay> some of the <malay>aminah punya</malay> friends right they <malay>tinggal</malay> condo [ah]
(uh)
so they are a bit different [lah] their their the way they
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (err) I guess that's <malay>macam</malay> we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence <malay>pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat</malay> they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
their upbringing is different right
(uh) distinction [lah] (uh)
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
<malay>yang pak ali</malay> [eh] you know <malay>pak ali</malay> always get the best grades <malay>macam</malay> dean's lists [lah] #borhan# also the one the radio <malay>warna</malay> right but they were from it doesn't
<malay>macam</malay> ya people used to think that (err)
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so [lah]
(uh)
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best [lah] the best usually not them [lah]
(uh) I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace [eh]
she he ya
ya
he was educated <malay>sayang</malay> he was educated when he was young he was educated in #eton# [tau]
he went to #eton# know that was his socialization [tau]
did I ask him what did you do he's <malay>baba budak orang baba</malay>
[oh] I (uh) my father owns a travel agent company
(uh)
<malay>tak tahu betul ke tidak</malay>
(uh) and then

<malay>dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi</malay> tuition
<malay>dia pergi</malay> tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition

(uh) teaching <malay>macam</malay> he has he has his full time job
even after <malay>tu dia</malay> continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so <malay>macam</malay> you know you have this
but he's very nice [lah] I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time <malay>kita</malay> because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you <malay>berbual</malay> and then <malay>dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang</malay> so most of the time we speak <malay>melayu</malay> and <malay>baba</malay> so
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him [oh] can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me [lah] of course [lah] he won't pay for it [lah] but because it's my <malay>mahal</malay> right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there <malay>dia beli dia ingat</malay> I don't know how it is now terrence
I I found out that he was educated at #eton# so I was like #eton# then #dasha# was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to (err) the people in #eton# but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the #eton# boys (err) russian [lah]
#eton# is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
no no no <malay>dia nak pergi</malay> actually <malay>tak nak pergi</malay> singapore
<malay>tapi dia kata dia</malay> not good enough [lah] #dasha# <malay>kata sebab tu</malay> #eton# they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually #eton# then after that the #eton# got
a professor but <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah]
or american [eh] but very fluent in russian and then because (err) project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but <malay>macam macam</malay> russian only a few know
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
[ah] ya
(uh)
(uh huh)
by russia [ah] no (uh) but (uh)
ya and and and the thing is is not just (uh) it's not just vietnam but also (uh) indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
(err) study in russia because russia (uh) (uh) study medicine in russia
I told you about this malay girl who studied russian I don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year [ah] to brush up on her russia before she
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> be you know why they go to russia because <malay>dia punya</malay> tuition fee
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to or america (uh) it's recognise [lah]
singapore I <malay>tak tahu</malay> but (uh)
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when (err) #kacha# was telling me #kacha# the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to #sarawak# or #sabah#
so there were (err) she was speaking russian to her husband and <malay>dia</malay> she have two children two or three children they all go to #sabah# or #sarawak# then after that <malay>yang orang kat belakang dia</malay> there's this man [ah] (err) medical doctor
<malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns (err) medicine in russia
(uh)
!huh!

but she cannot come and work here
<malay>tak</malay> recognise #kelantan# <malay>punya</malay> medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes <malay>dia</malay> come back
(err) to be <malay>dia kerja kat</malay> #mendaki# [kan] <malay>arwah dia</malay> until he very sick already he went over there

to send her daughter to australia
<malay>mahal</malay>
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why <malay>dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka</malay> australia
[ah] because <malay>dia tak</malay> stress [lah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore
the pace of life is different [lah]

ya
strength
their strength is languages (uh)
ya
ya
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology <malay>siapa si</malay>
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test [leh]
ya but we we found out from my
<malay>ustazah yang</malay> teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example <malay>yang daripada</malay>
(err) university of
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
jordan and the university of
not cairo [lah] (err) #al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
(uh) it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
it's not considered a degree level <malay>macam</malay> for example you want to be a teacher right
they don't consider a degree for #al-azhar# a degree
yes that's what my <malay>ustaz</malay> told me
so <malay>macam</malay> it has to be like they recognize degree
(uh)
don't know #allahu aalam#
jordan I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
could be [ah] because <malay>mak dia mak dia tak nak</malay> but but but (uh) the <malay>ustaz kata</malay> that's the reason <malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>kita dapat</malay> second upper the second upper (uh) or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya
ya that's why like people say why they go to <malay>madrasah</malay> for that's the big question everybody ask
<malay>siapa</malay>
(uh) #wani# [eh]
<malay>agaknya</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
I don't know now (err) COVID I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
unless they do online [lah] unless they do online [lah] but I don't know #al-azhar# now not that good [lah]
so that's why a lot of people recommend <malay>pergi</malay> jordan
there's <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
the system of learning [ah]
(err) I think ever since the the egyptian spring [ah] uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time [lah] we know that the story [lah]
[oh] now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
[kan] <malay>itu hari si</malay> king of jordan <malay>datang</malay>
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like <malay>tiga empat daripada</malay> eygpt and then she knows other dialect [lah] so <malay>dia kata ada kesian</malay> because she was telling me because <malay>dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz</malay>
<malay>ustaz hasan</malay> so <malay>dia bilang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia bilang dengan</malay> I [lah] some of them come from <malay>negeri yang</malay> you know they come from <malay>kampung</malay> so only know dialect [tau] <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend [ah]
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
and this lady have a condition [ah] <malay>dia kata</malay> then I ask (err) your cousin [eh] how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into [eh] [a'ah] <malay>kak tini bukan senang</malay> you know like <malay>nak kena ni nak kena</malay> surgery <malay>nak kena ni</malay> can you imagine <malay>nak kena</malay> like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime <malay>tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata</malay> and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people <malay>agaknya derma</malay> I think embassy <malay>derma agaknya</malay> and then spend money on them you know (err) spend the money on translations (err) these translators
[oh] ya because the the king would (err) #hussein# not #hussein# I I I <malay>kenal bini dia</malay> (uh) he was very impressed the singapore side very <malay>cepat</malay> very efficient
but when I was telling doctor <malay>ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia</malay> showing off
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
(uh) that is the rumour [lah] that she <malay>tunjuk</malay> the <malay>jam</malay>
(uh) but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
(err) at the
(uh)
(err) visa at the jordianian embassy [ah]
ya but it's also something that has strength [lah] because her #fusha# is very good like the <malay>orang arab dengar</malay> #fusha# [lah] <malay>yang</malay> I try to <malay>berbual dengan ustazah hadijah</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> #fusha# but okay so <malay>macam</malay> the the difficult dialect is not egyptian [lah] according to them [lah] but I don't know I <malay>tengok</malay> egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt <malay>punya</malay> dialect very near #fusha# the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran [lah] you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the #fusha#
<malay>banyak orang arab banyak</malay> [kan] very diverse
that's the that's the thing [lah] so they get whatever they can
<malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> egypt <malay>itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama</malay> she even take she even take #talaqqi# courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take #talaqqi# she taught she taught me how to <malay>tajwid</malay>
she told me <malay>yang</malay> the and then when I ask #abi# #abi# say <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>ada yang ustaz yang</malay> famous <malay>sampai boleh kalau</malay> you <malay>buat salah</malay> your <malay>bacaan sampai boleh ambil</malay> you know your you know the what is that thing [ah]
when they collect the smoke the cigarette <malay>punya</malay> ashes [leh]
(uh) they can throw that at your face
like <malay>garang</malay> [ah]
you know but that is the the the nature [lah] but then you want to get the #sadat# [eh] they call it #sadat# you you want to get #sadat# so you do that [lah]
let her just stay here [lah] let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
let her <malay>bukan</malay> poly <malay>tak boleh pakai tudung pakai</malay> [jer] <malay>tudung kat</malay> poly
(uh)
or you want her to go okay [lah] go <malay>pakai</malay> then there's the other thing [lah]
I think (err) <malay>tengok</malay> appetite <malay>dia macam</malay> math and science
language is a bit hard [lah]
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
(uh)
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength [ah]
in singapore you cannot do well <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I don't think so [lah]
(uh) I mean I have friends who who like for example #murni# and I have a mutual friend
(err) <malay>namanya</malay>
(err) okay [lah] one of our girlfriends [lah]
so I'm not that close to her [lah] because
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] I just <malay>tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat</malay> [lah] but she's very close to #murni# so now she's the
<malay>punya</malay> translation unit she she's the head you know
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
<malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>selalu berbual dengan dia</malay>
then I made her watch asian <malay>alida bahasa melayu</malay> I even I even (err)

why what
good men
<malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] like let's same [ah] like my my brothers can do whatever they want <malay>perempuan aje</malay> like the rules only ya because they're they're guys ya the rules only apply to girls guys ya [lah] <malay>dorang lelaki nanti dorang selalu cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>biar</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang lelaki</malay>
everyone [ah]
it's it's the it's the same concept as the westerners [ah] like when the girl have sex a lot she's considered a slut but when the guy have sex a lot they're considered <malay>macam</malay> !wow! a man ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
so it's the same concept [ah] I think I think I think everywhere is facing it everywhere is facing it
or is it it comes from the western [ah] so <malay>orang tengok macam gitu</malay> [kan]
ya
the children the the children will <malay>tengok</malay> at how their parents are [ah] <malay>nanti kalau dorang nampak dorang macam dorang nampak macam</malay> if let's say <malay>dorang nampak</malay> the father <malay>kurang ajar dengan mak dia nanti</malay> they also know they will do that to the girls also
(mm)
(mm)
ya
it's no [lah] sometimes it's not about the father also sometimes because <malay>sekarang perempuan semua</malay> they want to be feminists ya that's also the problem ya <malay>perempuan perempuan</malay> wants the same status and rank as the guy so <malay>macam</malay> ya <malay>sekarang</malay> wives <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> women now don't want to show that women need men
ya <malay>sekarang susah</malay>
<malay>nanti dia cari orang lain yang perlukan dia</malay>

okay [lah] anyway it's already one hour
ya do we have to clap I don't know I don't know ya ya I think press pause and then tick okay okay
pause and then tick [ah]

okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
I definitely eat <malay>rendang</malay>
yes
cause
<malay>rendang</malay> actually that's a good question why <malay>tau</malay> because
I <malay>selalu makan rendang</malay>
when
<malay>hari raya</malay> but then <malay>mak mak</malay>
<malay>mak</malay> always <malay>masak</malay> like anytime she wants
so when she everytime <malay>masak</malay> I everytime <malay>makan</malay> and I love the taste of <malay>rendang</malay>
so I <malay>makan</malay> everyday [ah]
and like you know I have I've ever gone
<malay>dua bulan makan rendang</malay> straight
not really [ah]
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if I were to eat
rendang with rice today
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe <malay>petang makan</malay> with <malay>roti</malay> then <malay>malam makan dengan</malay> noodle
<malay>faham</malay>
yea
ya [lah] <malay>ketupat</malay> is the best [lah] definitely
you put <malay>serunding</malay> !oof!
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
!huh!
what
why
[oh] okay
actually <malay>kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan</malay> noodles and like
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
you had <malay>lemak cili api</malay> pasta
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle [what]
besides
you know the
#lanzhou# beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes !oof!
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah [oh] my god
you know just now
tender
<malay>sendu sendu apa</malay>
<malay>sedap je</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>pekat</malay>
<malay>sendu lain</malay> [lah]
<malay>sendu lain seru pun lain</malay>
but
the what reason
pettiest
(mm)
I
I can't think of one yet you go on first
[oh] my god is that your
<malay>macam</malay> step know it all [ah]
<malay>kan</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> the big shot [ah]
actually I I cannot I cannot stand
people <malay>yang</malay> ego
they are like
how I say [eh]
they
well I had the answer in my mind but I don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no [lah] I mean like I'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
so <malay>macam</malay>
I just can't stand <malay>kalau orang nak macam nak</malay> step <malay>besar</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> step <malay>orang yang nak</malay> step I really just cannot
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion [ah] <malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion
ya so like
(uh) actually
more better <malay>lebih baik</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay>
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
[ah] this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
then <malay>hidup tak ada</malay> objective
<malay>tak ada makna</malay> ya because for example if someone
right now in the world when there are doctors especially this kind of (uh) jobs doctors so if no they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah (uh) that should be my answer but if
work in terms of because <malay>orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu</malay>
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
ya so <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] so <malay>macam buang masa</malay> [ah] <malay>hidup</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
that's what I feel [lah] because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on on the fence [ah] on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
(mmhmm)
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed <malay>banyak banyak</malay> industry he <malay>dah masuk</malay> he fail <malay>banyak</malay>
but then
at forty two [eh] forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
and then after the <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>buat</malay> the apprenticeship <malay>dengan</malay> tattoo artist <malay>dia buka kedai dia sendiri</malay>
at forty five and <malay>kedai dia</malay> successful
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but (uh)
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at [ah]
(mmhmm)
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
(mmhmm) but the moral is don't give up [ah]
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
you <malay>rasa</malay> you
<malay>dah puas</malay> with the thing you <malay>buat</malay> [kan]
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
if not <malay>sampai bila bila pun kan</malay> you <malay>tak akan</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> that this is the life that I want
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said [ah] everything you explore
on after the next day
all that thing <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> explore remain inside your body
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at [lah]
(mmhmm)
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
!wow! okay
okay
that's the first wish [eh]
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this [one] it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
(um)
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff <malay>kan</malay> you know I did all traditional stuff
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
and <malay>susah untuk kita nak</malay>
<malay>ubah pikiran orang</malay>
yes
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
that society <malay>punya ape tu</malay> what do you call it requirement
the society's
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
[oh] yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions I take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like [oh] my god I shouldn't have done this I should have done this instead I should have
I don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
(mmhmm)
I mean
that's good for you [lah] because I hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me [ah] I just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
<malay>apa</malay>
yeah you go first [ah] I <malay>tak tahu apa nak</malay>
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook [oh]
why didn't you take culinary [eh]
I think you will like breeze through that course easily
[oh] okay
because <malay>melayu</malay> always <malay>masak with agak agak</malay>
so it's nice when it's <malay>agak agak</malay>
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
(hmm)
yeah
precisely what I what I I said [lah] it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
I want the <malay>rendang</malay> italian
italian
<malay>rendang</malay>
<malay>rendang</malay>
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
I wish for the arts industry to
in this country
no it's a fun thing like because
no no like because that's what I really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well
and make it as a career with all the talent they have
yeah I want that that'll be great
ya but they don't pay as good I don't want to get into details but
yeah you know I know
yup
yeah yeah
ya so
just just just
you know
okay [ah] what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it

I will <malay>makan</malay> it with Milo or like or like <malay>minum teh gitu</malay> then I will eat the <malay>biskut</malay> together
ya so
that <malay>biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah]</malay> with my <malay>datuk</malay> so I used the <malay>biskut</malay> as the background of the painting then (uh) for the forefront of the painting like I put (uh) my sofa all like from the living room
and also (err)
there was a portrait of me and my family like sitting on the sofa and like (uh) our expressions were like sad [lah] to show
like tribute <malay>gitu</malay>

(uh)
apples was also like something that reminded me of my grandfather because he he always knows that (uh) I like I like to eat apples so he or he would always like buy buy for me then leave it in the fridge then ask me to eat
so ya I made the pillows like (uh) apple like texture so ya it was kinda cool it's cool and for like the second
the second time I took (uh) O level art (um) it was
it was
I don't know it was like a quiff
artwork [ah] it was it was like mostly about my hair [lah] about my pink hair I don't like I didn't like it
at that time
it was just like a form of like expression
like (uh) previously there were like some people who say like I I wouldn't look nice with pink hair ya will look like
I don't know gross or something but then I'm like
no I'm gonna do it I'm gonna prove you wrong so I did it so I dyed my hair pink so like that became like my whole theme for my second artwork
so it was like
flowing hair
(uh) for like most of it was like a long canvas then then in the middle was like a self portrait and there was like ya a few other portraits around it
and I incorporated my sister in the artwork
so ya that was kind of cool
I miss painting and drawing
also like lately I've been trying to draw a lot

so ya a lot of shit also is like content heavy [lah]
I think ever since like this intern right it really made me reflect on
like
what I want to do for the future and also like
what kind of work I want to be in too I think for now like my plan is like (err)
hopefully my grades is like good enough to go university [lah]
then (uh) let's see if I don't go to university
I think I might go for
earn and learn programme
ya like
like you study
but you also work at the same time
it's like
ya like
like you study for a few months then you go like attachment
so it's like a specialised diploma which I which I think is quite cool [lah]
like it's
some it's like a choice
that I can try
if if legit like I can't go to university or can't go to like earn and learn then I might just go to work [orh]
then if I go work I will I will like
work for two years then hopefully I can like try to
convince my future managers to send me to further studies
ya that's the plan
(mm)
<malay>tapi sekarang susah</malay> [lah] because (uh) COVID ya then <malay>banyak orang</malay>
that <malay>masuk</malay> that programme <malay>jadi</malay> to have something to fall back on
because the pay for it is
still
legit [lah] compared to like having <malay>tak ada kerja langsung</malay> [kan]
true true
ya
it's quite sad
and I heard like there there will be like a second wave [kan]
ya
like
true
imagine those <malay>lagi</malay> like
two K jobs like only earn like two K plus or like one K plus if you cut it even more it's like can barely survive [seh]
true
ya
but that's so bad [lah] obviously you have to change your lifestyle and if that happens

confirm when I grow up I want to be a farmer
I don't know
I don't know <malay>macam</malay> cool
okay [lah] that
that kinda satisfies the my dream a bit
but I want to be like a full on farmer I don't know I think I've had this dream like since secondary school

<malay>macam rendam kat dalam air ke apa</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
(um) <malay>dia punya buah dia</malay> like

(mm)
[oh] [ah]
I need that
I need that in my life but it's it's probably a lot of like
maintenance like you probably need to really take care of the plants and you really have to take care of the fish
I think you'll get dirty quite fast though
true
I think the the poop is gonna be more
than what the plant take in
damn that's
change the world
(ugh) (uh) is this a question
[oh] okay okay [ah] change the world I don't know [oh] my god I want to be more environment friendly [oh] my god talking about environment friendly
so I join like (uh)
like I join [ah] then I went to this
this (uh)
what's it called
I don't know what is it call it's like a outing I don't know it's like [oh] it it's a volunteer it's a volunteering
like (uh)
stands for bring your own bag like (uh)
they held this thing like (uh) we had to go to like various supermarkets then after that (err) we took the like bags that were donated from the public
then (um) we will take out those (uh) which are dirty then we will we will take the clean ones then (uh) we will go to the various supermarkets then we will offer
people who didn't bring their own bags so we will offer like the tote bags that were donated to for them to use as
like the grocery bags [ah] so it was quite so it's a
(uh) then
I think that is like actually a small thing that can like change the world like in a way like we should really like
cut down on our like plastic consumption [lah]
I think like plastic is really bad for us
like is so ingrained in our society that it's like super hard for like the society to change
but I like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like <malay>macam</malay>
singapore <malay>cuba</malay> try
to
<malay>jadi macam</malay> more environment friendly
like
I don't know <malay>dia orang buat</malay> like <malay>macam ada</malay> certain
like they implement like certain things [ah] to make it better
like I think the like #pulau semakau# like the like the island they put the trash all like
is getting filled out like quite fast [ah] then they go through
ya we will be fourty
ya but I feel like that tension is right not really pushing people like I feel like singaporeans are just like
just rich like <malay>dia orang rasa</malay> like that <malay>sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu</malay> so <malay>dia orang macam</malay> [oh] just <malay>bayar</malay> it <malay>gitu</malay>
so like they will still <malay>bayar</malay> it like that ten cent like I think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something I know fifty cents [kan] confirm <malay>orang macam lagi terasa macam</malay> like [oh] my god that is like <malay>duit</malay> like I should really <malay>bawa</malay> my own plastic bag or like bag in general

(mm) I think I cannot [lah] I remember when I was in primary school
the moment they stress me about studies I cannot function any more
ya
(mm) ya kind of mine wasn't give up I just cannot function
no okay I I have a reasoning
you know why it's because [kan]
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day [what]
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous (uh) homework [lah]
the later you do the more you'll remember
that was my rationale
no [meh]
it's like
okay for example [eh] you
I don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember [what]
until now I still do that
[ah] [lah] primary school not that hard
I didn't say it wasn't that hard
to not remember a lot of things
because the teacher make us struggle
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)

ya (um) ya so (um) I I got into an internship <malay>dia ajar bukan ajar</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> it's speech and drama so I (um) my course actually applied drama and psychology (uh) so <malay>macam</malay> my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they <malay>macam</malay> post me to (uh) this early childhood not early childhood [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like somewhat <malay>macam budak-budak dia macam</malay> actually interested (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I got confuse I think I more interested in the (uh) in the drama side instead of teaching <malay>budak-budak</malay>
ya
when I was in internship [oh] (uh) so <malay>pagi kita</malay> okay (uh) so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so <malay>pagi</malay> (uh) <malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> it's just admin job then the admin job <malay>pun macam</malay> like <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] I mean like it was difficult because halfway <malay>kita punya</malay> supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in (uh) the company because of some things happen (uh) then (uh) so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then <malay>baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang</malay> for class [kan] then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just (uh) <malay>tolong</malay> the teacher to just hype the class <malay>nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap</malay> something funny then we're just like (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> [oh] my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stupid <malay>gitu tapi macam</malay>
ya it's like to encourage them to <malay>macam</malay> speak up <malay>macam</malay> do do the drama with them <malay>macam</malay> we will have like (um) dramas (uh) drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
okay okay
ya so like now I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I <malay>nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak</malay> or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
(um) actually it's not like allow allow not like <malay>dia orang suka-suka nak</malay> allow but it's like (um) it's a bit unethical for me to work there also [lah] because like (err) I've been having <malay>macam</malay> low moods and stuff so <malay>macam kesian the budak-budak</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) I honestly <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so <malay>macam</malay> I I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if it's because of my (um) my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm (um) but I I came clean to my boss like I <malay>bilang dia</malay> (uh) whatever that's been happening in my life then she say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I don't think you're you're capable of working now so <malay>macam</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> set my head straight [lah] (uh) maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel <malay>macam</malay> hundred percent here [lah] because like right now you're a like everywhere
ya
to to work he he he said you can go back right
ya existed that this he welcomes welcomed back then that's good
(mm) but like (um) ya
(mm)
[oh]
ya
ya
and that's a big decision to make [seh] because like (um) it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then <malay>macam</malay> in the future like <malay>kalau lambat</malay> then you it's hard for you to change but now <malay>macam</malay> is the time (um) for us to <malay>macam</malay> explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>susah</malay>
ya unless <malay>kalau kita kerja</malay> part time <malay>yang macam</malay> (um) temperature taking <malay>gitu semua</malay> I mean it's it's okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> good ya it's better than nothing <malay>tapi macam</malay> the thing is [ah] I'm just worried <malay>macam</malay> this is just <malay>macam</malay> just graduate [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I think too much about stuff then (um) if I take that kind of job now then <malay>macam</malay> I don't have like much experience in like (uh) what I want to do in the future <malay>dia macam</malay> I scared <malay>macam</malay> I'm not prepared [lah] but this is just me overthinking [lah] but (um) if <malay>dapat dapat kerja</malay> the temperature taking <malay>pun macam bersyukur</malay> [seh] as of now
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
<malay>berapa lama</malay> the the webinar
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] but like !huh!
ya
(hmm)
that sounds great then I think (err) my sister also took that job [ah] last month but like so like webinar you don't have to go to any venue [kan]
(hmm)
!wow! that's really good because like actually (um) when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to <malay>macam</malay> a diploma conversion ya so but then (um) for now obviously cannot (uh) go to the school [lah] the <malay>tapi nanti</malay> if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I I don't know I feel like <malay>macam</malay> its a bit more demanding in a way <malay>macam</malay> and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit <malay>macam</malay> focused on like just real school
[oh] no (uh) it's not (uh) teaching the kids at home but (err) <malay>apa itu</malay> it's just like normal school <malay>macam</malay> we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning <malay>baru kita</malay> teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two (um) one we teach the kids at school real kids then <malay>balik</malay> then (err) the teacher that lecturer will teach us <malay>pula</malay> on like about kid
(um) honestly I feel like a bit <malay>macam</malay> I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class <malay>tapi</malay> (um) from what I think [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it depends on the company you work with <malay>kalau</malay> the company <malay>macam</malay> give you a lot of (uh) things to do like homework <malay>macam</malay> preparing worksheets for the kids <malay>tu semua</malay> they don't have like a proper system like <malay>tak ada macam mana</malay> [eh] they <malay>tak ada</malay> their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so <malay>macam</malay> it's that already a a lot of workload then <malay>kita pergi sekolah</malay> we have also we also have our assignment and like test <malay>tu semua</malay> ya so it's like it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> scary [kan]
[ah]
ya I feel I felt that way [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> that's why I felt really <malay>macam</malay> (um) I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown <malay>semua</malay>
(um) I think they because there's only one that just (uh) finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said <malay>macam</malay> is going to be difficult [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> (um) the <malay>tempat kerja</malay> even weekend sometimes the boss I think <malay>macam</malay> she didn't like intentionally do this <malay>tapi macam</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay> she will like text us during the weekends <malay>macam</malay> to tell us need to do this this this so <malay>macam</malay> (um) my colleague <malay>yang</malay> just finish the diploma <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then <malay>macam</malay> we we also have the our stuff to do so <malay>macam</malay> she she felt like it's a bit difficult [lah] to go through
that so <malay>macam</malay> she she was concerned about me [lah] because like she she knew that (uh) it's going to be tough for me and especially now [kan] (um) that's not enough teacher the card the company so so <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of <malay>macam</malay> pressure on on the new teachers <malay>macam kita</malay> not teachers [lah] <malay>macam</malay> supposedly I'm not supposed to teach [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> they try their best not to <malay>macam</malay> expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper <malay>tapi macam</malay> sometimes <malay>nak tak nak macam takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>nak biarkan</malay> the company to drown [kan] like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya <malay>macam</malay> that's why <malay>macam</malay> she say it will be early will be more tough on me [lah] because everything is new then <malay>nak kena belajar nak kena</malay> adapt to the changes then like (uh) <malay>nak kena apa belajar lagi</malay>
(hmm) ya ya
so now you doing (um) a part time and working it's continue working at your industry or like on break too
(hmm)
[oh]
(hmm)
true
ya true
(hmm) (hmm)
[oh] so how is it so far
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm) ya
#amin# sure #inshaallah#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya that's why (hmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's good
[ah] [ah]
[oh]
stress free
[oh] man ya that feels like me
!wah!
but then like okay so why why <malay>macam</malay> I'm stressing myself [kan] like I agree with you <malay>macam</malay> since since secondary school I already told myself <malay>macam kalau tak</malay> happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then (um) but then now [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>takut</malay> because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre <malay>tapi kat</malay> singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this <malay>nak buat</malay> theatre <malay>macam mana</malay> [kan] like there's no audience but I know there's some like <malay>macam</malay> virtual and stuff but then <malay>macam</malay> virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously (err) you it's easier for you to (um)
(uh) to stay there [lah] <malay>macam</malay> to continue from where you are <malay>tapi macam kalau</malay> you are not in the theatre company then <malay>macam susah nak dapat nak ada</malay> audition <malay>pun tak ada</malay>
ya
early childhood (um) the thing is like for early childhood [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak ada</malay> (um) much experience other than my internship internship ya so (err) I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like (um) there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is (err) is (err) the company itself <malay>yang</malay> I am in right now is actually <malay>macam</malay> they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that (um) she <malay>tak ini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> expect us to stay very long she just (uh) provide a platform for a like a stepping stone <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> she she encourages people to ya she <malay>macam</malay> looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing <malay>macam</malay> I know deep down that I am interested in theatre [lah] to I want to <malay>macam</malay> act again and stuff <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know in singapore <malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so much that's the pressure [lah] ya I want to do theatre <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
(uh) for like <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay> early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then <malay>macam</malay> and early childhood is not bad the the pay [kan] especially in singapore because they need people but then like (um) and like if I don't continue for early childhood I <malay>macam</malay> I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit [lah] honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like <malay>macam</malay> average [lah] <malay>tapi jap</malay> [eh] my mum my mum is like texting me
ya ya okay later I come back to that
I'm twenty
ya
[oh] okay
that's good
(mm) ya
that's that's sweet because like my mom <malay>dia macam</malay> passive aggressive <malay>tak tahu nak cakap macam mana</malay> it's like ya she <malay>macam</malay> I (um) because <malay>dari kecil</malay> we don't really <malay>macam</malay> (um) not very affectionate we are <malay>macam</malay> okay ya so <malay>macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia</malay> a bit awkward <malay>macam nak</malay> open up <malay>pun</malay> a bit awkward
then <malay>macam</malay> every time <malay>macam dari kecil</malay> I <malay>nangis</malay> about like [oh] my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so <malay>macam</malay> like she taught me to be tough [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like (err) emotions she put away emotions <malay>tu</malay> so <malay>macam sekarang</malay> I <malay>sedih</malay> I <malay>marah</malay> or like anything [lah] then I cannot like go to her to talk about things [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> I try my best <malay>walaupun dia macam</malay> push or try to avoid the emotion [kan] I will just like
try my best to explain to her [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what I'm feeling this way because this this this <malay>tapi</malay> then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I <malay>cakap</malay> face to face she will <malay>macam</malay> like (um) suddenly become very cold then <malay>macam</malay> don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things <malay>macam</malay> (err) (err) if you cannot do it then I cannot force you <malay>macam</malay> that kind of stuff you know so <malay>macam</malay> I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not <malay>macam</malay> put any pressure on me but <malay>macam</malay> that itself already made me (err) pressurize ya
(mm)
ya
so so it's like (um) so if I (uh) like I what I wanted to say just now was (um) because if I don't want to continue with this early childhood right my other choice is only the theatre come a theatre industry but then like I know theatre industry won't make much money [lah] as compared to early childhood
!huh! (err) (err) I I have seniors but then <malay>macam</malay> I don't really talk to them <malay>macam</malay> I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there <malay>macam</malay> I don't want to stop ya
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I go for the safest (uh) option first which is the early childhood [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it <malay>tapi macam kalau</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then <malay>macam</malay>
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off [lah] I would I would say so <malay>macam</malay> if like I don't have any this is just me [lah] (err) if I don't have any <malay>macam</malay> (um) any education or like any specific job in mind I scared <malay>macam</malay> like not good enough you know this is [kan]
(mm)
[ah]
(hmm) (hmm)
ya so (um) ya [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) as of now he keep on saying <malay>macam</malay> don't worry don't worry <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like (um) that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
like like (err) have you have you talk to your your boyfriend if you don't mind sharing
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
so he's okay [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
[oh] that's good
(mm) (mm) ya so like <malay>sekarang</malay> I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing [lah] because (um) it was a hard decision for me to make to like (uh) stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company (um) not preparing any anything for them <malay>macam macam</malay> very abruptly [lah] the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague <malay>yang</malay> [ah] the one that just went through the conversion she <malay>macam</malay> very quite helpful [lah] she <malay>macam</malay> keep on saying [oh] it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat (err) ya we teaching the we we you <malay>macam</malay> assisting the same class
(mm)
(hmm) (hmm) but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting (um) the the same level [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I was (err) more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare <malay>tu semua</malay> [kan]
then like (um) the the thing is they they have this thing in the company <malay>macam kalau</malay> craft teacher <malay>dengan</malay> language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that (err) idea so <malay>macam</malay> most of the time I was doing the craft then <malay>macam balik pun</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> craft weekends <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> craft so <malay>macam</malay> like it was really a lot of stress for me [lah] ya then (err) <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> I that point of time <malay>geram dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia</malay> keep on saying <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I'll do it I'll do it <malay>tapi</malay> end up <malay>tak buat</malay> so I <malay>macam</malay> pressured [lah] because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson [kan] <malay>macam</malay> the one
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it was really really irritating then <malay>sampai</malay> like (um) the colleagues (uh) [ah] my other colleagues we very small company [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> they they saw me struggling <malay>gitu macam</malay> everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then (err) I my contract <malay>pula</malay> my timing ends at one thirty [ah] but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty <malay>gitu tapi</malay> my my timing [kan] I'm always there until four until three so <malay>macam</malay>
no no that's that's the thing so the company <malay>macam</malay> we already say in the contract so <malay>macam</malay> it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so <malay>macam</malay> ya that sucks [lah] that's <malay>macam</malay> that's why I feel like <malay>macam kalau</malay> I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm <malay>rabak</malay>
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so (um) if you have a diploma already but then you want to to <malay>macam</malay> decided to go for early childhood industry [kan] so you can apply at an at and then (err) and will consider [ah] <malay>macam</malay> but most of the time they will they will accept you [ah] because <malay>macam tak banyak</malay> in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya <malay>tak</malay> I don't think is [lah] because like (um) it this is there's a stereotype of like (err) early childhood teachers gets a lot of because (um) there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that <malay>tak banyak</malay> in singapore <malay>nak buat</malay>
ya I don't know what to say about that so (err) so the the the diploma conversion (um) after we apply but then (err) we we find a company first [lah] we find the company we can get sponsorship if we work with the company less than six months
then (um) if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say [lah] the company wants to sponsor you then (um) they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so <malay>macam</malay> diploma <malay>tu semua macam</malay> (uh) your O level english <malay>tu semua</malay> and then (err) they will contact you [lah] [eh] but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and (um) october
ya
(uh) I right now I don't know if I want to continue [lah] because like after talking to you then <malay>macam</malay> like really make me realize <malay>macam</malay> ya I should just <malay>macam</malay> do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
(hmm)
(hmm)
(um) that's that's good but then like (um) that's I used to have savings (um) before before joining the company [kan] and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop <malay>rosak</malay> so I decided to buy a new laptop [lah] so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then <malay>macam</malay> the laptop won't be so much [lah] and I also look for a cheap laptop not like <malay>macam</malay> one thousand plus <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then (um) after I got the laptop so <malay>macam</malay> my savings to <malay>terjejas</malay> like affected already then then like (err) when I join the company then I got the pay already right then <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] my first pay so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>belanja</malay> my my family to eat <malay>tu semua</malay> then like my boyfriend leaving so <malay>macam</malay> I help him with (um) (err) not help him <malay>macam</malay> like I give him as a gift to <malay>semua macam barang-barang</malay> for but not everything [lah] within just a few then <malay>macam</malay> I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like (um) broke <malay>macam</malay> mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like (um) I I didn't expect things to happen then <malay>macam</malay> my savings <malay>pun</malay> now like <malay>terjejas</malay> my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then <malay>macam</malay> I really feel <malay>macam</malay> everything is just
it's just <malay>cubaan</malay> now [lah]
(uh) haven't yet because like I it's just everything just started I just really like (err) I just quit my job last week
ya but it's very pressurizing [lah] because like
(hmm)
ya but like I like mention [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my (err) my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
(uh) no I actually still have contract before until next year december ya
(err) she if I terminate the contract supposingly I have to pay like six thousand dollars
(um) so but a bit too <malay>macam</malay> you know so that people don't just terminate contracts <malay>suka hati</malay> ya so but I I brought it up to her [lah] about my situation <malay>tu semua</malay> but she quite understanding she say <malay>macam</malay> the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality [lah] it's not really <malay>macam</malay> to force to force you to pay or what
so <malay>macam</malay> she just <malay>macam</malay> let (err) let me (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> not pay it [eh] not pay her and just <malay>macam</malay> take a break first but like (err) she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her [lah] because really make
(err) I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> I feel the guilt [lah] because I told her that I want to continue working but like (um) I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that [lah] honestly because like at that point of time I really you <malay>macam</malay> have a lot in mind so <malay>macam</malay> I tell her stuff that I <malay>macam</malay> regret now
(hmm)
I I don't know why I as of now I really <malay>macam</malay> feel like everything is (err) falling apart [lah] because (um) ya [lah] because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then (um) my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just <malay>tapi macam</malay> I had a past of like my (err) my father's death so <malay>macam</malay> it kind of like triggered me [lah] just <malay>macam</malay> ya that's what I'm thinking so like (um) he him leaving my changes trigger everything [lah] so (err) I'm feeling like really really <malay>macam</malay> at my lowest right now [lah] ya so <malay>macam</malay> I feel <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why <malay>macam</malay> I'm supposed to take a break during <malay>tapi macam</malay> my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working <malay>macam</malay> why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then <malay>macam</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> ya so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know I'm really lost right now [lah] so I'm trying my best to <malay>macam</malay> look for freelance work from home kind of thing

ya I hope too ya I think it's my house wifi [lah] ya I think our recording should be okay
then ya [lah] I I I understand why what you mean by <malay>macam</malay> (um) you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really I'm shy because I mean I'm in I'm from drama so I'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is (um) I overthink a lot [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> when people <malay>macam</malay> just hesitant to say something then I will straightaway think [oh] I'm asking too much and like I'm troubling her or him <malay>macam</malay> I will start to to question myself [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like am I am I like <malay>menyusahkan</malay> or not that kind of things that's why like I don't really wanna talk not because like (um) I ya [lah] <malay>sombong</malay> or what but ya I I think it's it will be great talking to someone (err) especially like someone that I don't know so <malay>macam</malay> I don't really have <malay>macam</malay> anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then <malay>macam</malay> ya
[oh]
[oh] that's so nice
it's like meant to be
ya I I think it will help definitely <malay>sikit ke banyak</malay> still help thank you so much but I just want I just want to say that I I'm really like amazed at how <malay>macam</malay> you're doing it for your own good it's like you you <malay>boleh</malay> make that decision you know of like (um) taking a break and like exploring new things like I I don't know if I were ever have the courage to do that
ya
ya
ya [lah]
ya
[ah] [ah]
ya that's true
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I <malay>masih macam</malay> like in the past as they have this <malay>macam</malay> (um) want to like put (uh) put some into my savings so like now <malay>macam</malay> even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so <malay>macam</malay> [oh] but [oh] my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just <malay>macam nak lepaskan</malay> anger <malay>gitu</malay> because like I'm so annoyed because (err) so this month <malay>punya</malay> pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so <malay>macam</malay> every time this month it's just very unlucky for me [lah] I got food poisoning [lah] I got like <malay>macam selesema</malay> [lah] because there has been like cold (uh) cold bug around the school so (err) then I got it also then I also <malay>macam ada</malay> panic attack in one of the night because I <malay>ingat</malay> I injured my neck so <malay>macam</malay> this month I took a lot of thinking that <malay>macam</malay> you can like I can claim from their [lah] then <malay>rupanya</malay> they cut cut it off from my from my <malay>gaji</malay> then because like (err) I still <malay>macam baru kerja situ</malay> it's still not three months yet something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard <malay>macam</malay> from my I'm not I don't know [lah] I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so <malay>macam</malay> and that's why I thought <malay>macam</malay> (um) we I already <malay>macam</malay> can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day <malay>baru</malay> like I she mentioned [ah] about <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so <malay>macam</malay> (uh)
the contract says I have (uh) I have seven days and like they never say any probation
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu</malay> [kan]
ya that's true
no they didn't
(err) ya [lah] doesn't <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> I just feel a lot of guilt (err) towards the company so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I want to bring it up or not [ah] because (err) then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then <malay>macam</malay> they cutting from my <malay>gaji</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I already had in mind okay my <malay>gaji</malay> month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they <malay>rupanya</malay> they will like <malay>macam</malay> will not get a refund if I <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> my <malay>gaji dah kurang</malay> then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay [kan] obviously the company won't ask won't <malay>macam</malay> want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then <malay>macam</malay> !aduh! <malay>sedih gila</malay> [seh]
ya
so it's like
like like I said [lah] that's why <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life (um) because like money wise then <malay>macam</malay> like (um) my boyfriend left for <malay>rasa macam</malay> got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really [lah] what's the everything is just falling apart
I have <malay>kakak</malay> but then like she she move out already because she <malay>nikah</malay>
(hmm) two actually but (um) my I'm not close to my eldest one because (uh) she we <malay>lain mak</malay>
<malay>sama bapak lain mak</malay>
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya
so
(um)
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like (um) that won't bring that I won't bring it back home <malay>macam buat kerja kat situ</malay> then <malay>balik tak buat apa-apa</malay>
<malay>macam kalau penat penat kat kerja</malay> [jer]
I mean other than like there's (um) part time like <malay>macam</malay> F&B <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] guess can can do that <malay>tapi macam</malay> I don't know I kind of I'm not (um) I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think <malay>macam</malay> I can (uh) I can stay in can do that kind of part time but <malay>macam</malay> if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm)
ya
ya maybe I could think of that too
(um) that's true [oh] my god I need to keep you on reminding myself that
(err) actually I just when yesterday (um) ya but then like (um) I I did not go poly though I I went to check organization do you know
organization so they are actually under <malay>macam</malay> they are more they work more with community instead of (err) [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> like you are the patient [kan] ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like you just <malay>macam</malay> go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then (um) <malay>macam</malay> they will tell you [lah] or you you might need <malay>macam</malay> counselling or what then <malay>macam</malay> they will refer you to them [lah] me (err) I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy [ah] I'm not so sure about that but then <malay>macam</malay> (um) because yesterday when they told me about the the (err) what I can do next then <malay>macam</malay> rate of like (err) what the next thing then we just counselling [lah] <malay>macam</malay> is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
(err) I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] don't really [ah] take you no cannot ya

there are animals coming from the ocean and the biggest like animals that you've never seen
right right right exactly it's deep down in the ocean still more living under there
and and the fact that whatever they found out now
is already scary and it's already big enough to actually conquer like to scare humans
you know and how humans now are brave enough to actually go
above beyond the ocean that they they can you know they like diving deeper and deep just to find out cause of their curiosity and then I think
at the same time with the virus like you said
you never know what's the next virus
like five years ago or like two years ago we never imagine we have to go out with a mask
SARS

so like let's say you know that the world is not doing well
okay what do you think in your power or your might your energy
what would you have done what would you do what would you be doing for that
for the country even though like you don't have much we're just normal people
we don't have much either but what would you do to actually you know
at least just humanity in whatever is happening
what would you do
right
like
true <malay>kita ikut apa yang kita nampak</malay>
influential that's that's it

(um)
one meal
or one dish they would eat for the rest of your life

named karma
a restaurant named karma
so by restaurant named karma right
karma is retribution is it retribution
<malay>kifarah</malay> like you get what you get

and what do you think you'll be served there's no food just to tell you karma you'll be served on what you have done so what do you think you'll be served
(mmhmm)
ya

<malay>walaupun kita rasa kita buat banyak baik</malay> but <malay>mesti ada satu kejadian</malay>
<malay>yang awak tak akan lupa mungkin awak rasa macam</malay> [oh] <malay>saya tak saya nampak</malay> auntie <malay>ni</malay>

you know like for example that's
you know it could be something like that could be something petty like that but at the same time we could be like
(um)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
what if people judge me
I'm always thinking like that
(mmhmm)
when you had the time
ya ya
right
I think
I think for me
myself would be (um) maybe (um) answering back to my parents
you know
cause I was at the I'm a very stubborn person if I think
I need to answer back like no matter who I would answer back you know and then if (um) I think there was a time where things wasn't going so well
so there was a time where I feel like I need to answer you back
cause you're not getting you're understanding me ya
so I think
the the dish that will be served for me would be (um)
ya it would be maybe like a mouth or something a tongue
probably cause I wasn't understanding of their situation either you know I wasn't trying to be
the kid who try to understand I was trying to be like you got to understand me cause I'm growing up
you're adult you know what I mean
ya so it it could be like if related to entering that probably a tongue or a mouth lip
you know
probably I mean
it's gonna be served to you
it's gonna be served to you so I don't know
it's a good one ya
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)

yet I have to stay from morning before he wakes up and up to the time he's asleep
you know I have to stay throughout the day I can't be like I'm tired and he's not well taken care of
you know I <malay>tak boleh masak</malay> and then when I <malay>balik kerja</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> (um)
ignore <malay>dia</malay> you know
<malay>biarkan dia buat kerja dia sendiri</malay> and I don't think having good looks would help with doing all those chores you know
you mean
ya people would be like [oh] my god pretty mum you know
ya but
but that's it you know what if you're not there for your child's carnival or like you can't run errands
yup

(mmhmm) <malay>bila awak rasa nak makan awak makan</malay>
who cares
ya
ya
right

but I know
I know you you have a high metabolism
right so I don't think I don't know whether it's true for you to actually like lose weight you won't really gain a lot of weight
no
<malay>salah</malay>
(mm)
are you blaming on me
ya
right but you should be happy when you are losing your weight
was it was there actually (uh) a way for you to distress is that the way for you to actually
(mmhmm)
is it you were doing sports was that why your criteria you had to
like on a certain weight
eating certain things
true
I felt that too
(mmhmm)
it's bad
what
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
right
but I think as long as whatever weight you are I mean now
on a healthy weight even though let's say you're sixty or seventy but you're healthy you know you are you are not falling sick all the time you're not visiting the doctor all the time
you're not always like
(um) eating panadols to to to keep yourself alive I think that's fine
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
just health ya (mm) ya true cause
partner
(oo) !wow!
I feel I feel I think it comes back to this saying cause (um) you cannot have
no serious okay no if let's say ya I used to go for looks cause I don't do much to them you know what I mean and what I meant is like
(uh) they could be they they they just have to look good cause I want to look good
with them ya
like do I have a good
good appearance
ya example like but now more of like you're gonna do errands with me you know you got
no I'm not looking for a maid maid is like care for my job for my chores at home but what I mean is like
as long as they are healthy as long as (um) healthy being (um) happily not depressed not forced
you know they are happy and
they feel like whatever they are they know that they are loved
by their partner
you know they don't have to be like [oh] I have breakouts and you know like you gonna leave me you know I don't I
why
just use moisturiser or something I try to tell you that a lot of times you know
okay so for last question would be
if (um)
if you had a wish now
in this age and day
what would you wish for
what would you wish for that would
(um) like something that would help you with your life right now
you don't want to be materialistic
(mmhmm)

or house
is that what you're working towards to now
(mmhmm)
of course it does everything needs money
(mmhmm)
like it makes you feel satisfied too you feel like you have done your part at least you make other people life easier to you know like you could help with chores
like buying for them
things for their needs
(mmhmm)
you wish for that
okay for me I feel like I would want a house
a good house or I could really build
a home where you know (um)
it's comfortable it's big enough
it doesn't have to follow like the house you know the singapore standard house it I want to have like a a good
maybe
ya like it could be
beyond my imagination you know I just want a house with this big and then the final product would be however it be like you know I don't want the room to be this small but I want to be this big but it could be
end up a more than how many square feet
square foot it is you know
right
ya
for sure
(mmhmm)
right
(mmhmm)
<malay>kenapa kadang-kadang kita rasa macam</malay>
<malay>kita tak</malay>
complete with whatever we have <malay>kita tak rasa macam</malay>
at this age (um) <malay>aku rasa</malay> I'm doing just nice I'm doing fine or (um) at this age I'm doing okay you know I'm not that bad cause I'm still working or I'm still earning you know
(mm)

to yourself now

ago your thirteen years old self what would you have said to the two of you
patience at thirteen years old
or to your twenty three years old
to both

okay can you hear me
ya I can hear you clearly
we're talking about the cake <malay>jadi asal dengan</malay> cake <malay>tadi</malay>
ya
ya I saw the picture then after that you <malay>terus tukar daripada gambar jadi</malay> message from <malay>gambar</malay> then it become a message that is where <malay>saya macam</malay>
(mmhmm)
so that that was the part when I actually [eh] [ah] you ask you ask me cake because you didn't mention macaron <malay>lagi</malay> so it was just cake
but I I didn't know the the macaron was choose [a'ah] <malay>sebab tu saya tanya</malay>
(mmhmm)
but she didn't say what [oh] it's a mix [eh] macaron <malay>dia</malay> mix colour [jer] [ah]
is it [oh] you can choose different like I I I I don't eat macarons always so <malay>saya</malay> a bit lost
is it
<malay>tapi</malay> flavour no no no <malay>awak macam banyak-banyak</malay> flavour does it incur cost <malay>ataupun sama</malay> [jer] <malay>harga</malay>
[oh] okay I thought <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] it's not like <malay>semua satu satu satu macam</malay> (err) what you call it alternate <malay>macam selang-seli</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [eh] okay okay
<malay>mana dapat</malay> contact
[orh] <malay>abeh dia punya</malay> review is good

okay [ah] I I could be right <malay>betul saya rasa ada</malay> chance <malay>betul</malay>
but because usually cake <malay>tak akan datang terus dah diri gitu</malay> they need to <malay>susun letak</malay> and then they <malay>macam [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] [a'ah] [ah] (mmhmm)

[ah] no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had (um) indonesian <malay>punya</malay> maid so sometimes ya
ya
(uh) ya ya ya so actually (um) like last time my maid <malay>selalu</malay> (um) talk to me in in <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia <malay>macam</malay> I know how ya how to speak ya (hmm)
sorry
(um) actually it just <malay>baru baru</malay> start so <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>macam</malay> just had like briefing then (uh) so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
(hmm)
[oh] you you also quit your job ya
I see I see ya
(hmm)
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> health actually quite important [lah] (um) ya I <malay>rasa macam</malay> when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy <malay>macam</malay> what's the what's the point what's the point <malay>kalau kau pergi kerja</malay> everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy [lah] for your good for your health and stuff like that
same [lah] <malay>sama sama</malay> ya is is I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite common <malay>gitu</malay> to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
(um)
<malay>dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun</malay> in
you <malay>kerja</malay> [oh] so <malay>baru</malay> graduate also
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh]
<malay>dari dari</malay>
from which from which uni
[oh] sorry sorry from poly is it
okay okay
(hmm)
I see I see
[oh] drama side drama side <malay>macam buat apa</malay> like day to day like what is it like
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>untuk dia punya budak-budak</malay> that kind of thing [lah]
I see I see
(hmm)
okay okay
(hmm) so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company <malay>macam</malay> allows you to to to to take breaks in between [lah]
(mm) <malay>dia</malay> (mm) okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> like some some of us <malay>yang baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that <malay>macam</malay> when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like <malay>macam</malay> is it a mismatch of expectations <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> you thought it would be something else
(hmm)
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm) actually good good that your boss <malay>macam</malay> I recognize that you you need to take a break then (um) then <malay>kalau</malay> when you're better than you can always <malay>balik</malay> go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me (uh) ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I work for <malay>dua tahun</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) I tried <malay>dua</malay> company <malay>tapi macam</malay> (uh) at the same time it felt different <malay>tapi macam</malay> same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> if it's the industry <malay>punya</malay> issue or <malay>kalau</malay> I need to change industry <malay>atau</malay> change company ya <malay>macam</malay> that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to <malay>macam</malay> take a break and then (um) from there I explored different different <malay>punya</malay> industry and then (um) at the same time I <malay>kerja</malay> part time then (um) <malay>macam</malay> trying to at the same time I explore [lah] whether I feel <malay>nak</malay> stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough [lah] one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right <malay>macam</malay> you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya
correct
(mm)
ya at least some more now <malay>macam</malay> it's COVID <malay>punya</malay> period then then <malay>nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah</malay> then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
(mm)
it's something better than <malay>macam</malay> nothing right
(mm)
ya ya ya I think to be honest <malay>macam</malay> singaporean man a bit cautious or like became <malay>fikir banyak sangat</malay> of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then <malay>kalau</malay> doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so <malay>macam</malay> just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so <malay>macam</malay> at every ya every <malay>setiap pagi</malay> I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for <malay>macam tiga jam</malay> [jer] then (um) <malay>ada</malay> assignment then (um) some project ya just learning new things I guess
[oh] the the webinar is actually (uh) era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's <malay>enam enam bulan</malay> then ya at the same time they are <malay>macam</malay> giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya <malay>tapi</malay> those (hmm) <malay>tu</malay> actually <malay>untuk</malay> mid career adults [lah] <malay>macam</malay> those that <malay>ada</malay> work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new [lah] I guess ya
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tak payah</malay> because everyday <malay>macam</malay> is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
(hmm)
ya
but how <malay>macam mana nak</malay> teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
[oh] okay okay
(hmm) okay I see I see I see <malay>sebab dia</malay> what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
(hmm)
okay
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh] that's (hmm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> overload of things to to do right do you feel
<malay>tapi</malay> what about the your your other work <malay>punya</malay> colleagues like do they feel the same way
(hmm)
(hmm)
ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
I see I see
I see
that's true
(hmm) sounds very challenging [lah] <malay>macam susah</malay> so
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment [lah] so I started taking (um) (um) I started joining this financial advisory <malay>punya</malay> company then <malay>dia orang</malay> give like trainings (um) to to prepare us [lah] <malay>macam</malay> how to how to like you know prospect for clients <malay>macam</malay> how to (um) basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I <malay>rasa</malay> sales <malay>punya</malay> skill is quite important <malay>macam</malay> in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or <malay>kalau</malay> be it ideas or products to anybody [lah] so so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn <malay>macam susah</malay> to <malay>macam</malay> convince people (um) to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process [lah] I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
(hmm) I <malay>macam baru</malay> start meeting clients that (um) (uh) there are some (um) potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that [ah] ya
so (um) other than that <malay>macam</malay> I think you what you said about (um) an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive (um) like make you <malay>macam</malay> want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess <malay>tapi macam</malay> I haven't actually (um) had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then (um) for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to <malay>macam</malay> earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense <malay>macam</malay> or even though <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy <malay>macam</malay> ya like I don't <malay>bangun tak rasa macam</malay> stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work <malay>macam</malay> you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this <malay>macam</malay> how I felt [lah] everyday after after work last time like you <malay>balik rumah macam tak ada</malay> mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
[oh] man ya that feels like me
ya I think it's common like <malay>macam</malay> I spoke to my <malay>kawan</malay> my friends <malay>dia orang pun macam rasa</malay> the same the same thing [lah] ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
(hmm) yes yes yes
(mm)
(mm)
then you got try <malay>macam</malay> try company company <malay>lain tak</malay> like because <malay>ini</malay> your first job [kan]
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether <malay>macam</malay> is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
(hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
but you said you did the conversion
(mmhmm)
I see I see so this is like the conversion thing you're talking about [lah] [oh] okay
(mm)
ya
(hmm)
is it you are supporting financially <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>dia boleh</malay> pay for <malay>dia punya</malay> own things like [oh] is it difficult
(mm)
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay (um) so (um) ya it's really <malay>macam</malay> it's I think <malay>sekarang</malay> we're in a very difficult <malay>punya</malay> position <malay>pasal</malay> there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
[oh] you are twenty only [oh] sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my <malay>mak</malay> and my my dad don't pressure me [lah] like because ya even though I'm already twenty five <malay>tapi dia orang macam</malay> they know it's not easy [lah] our time to like they said last last time by twenty five <malay>dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak</malay> you know that kind of thing but they but they don't <malay>macam</malay> push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think [ah] <malay>macam syukur</malay> [lah] like I feel quite
not stressed at home which is great [lah] because some people feel stressed at work and at home you know that another thing ya so I'm thankful for that ya I'm thankful for that at least ya
[oh] I know what that means ya
[eh] same same ya
same same
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh]
(mm) I see ya I think <malay>macam</malay> same my family <malay>macam</malay> not very affectionate also when growing up what <malay>macam</malay> don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
ya I think it's common more common that you think but like at the same time it's not that great not something to be proud of ya ya
(mm)
you <malay>ada</malay> connections with like theatre <malay>punya</malay> (um) like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
no time is it like no (hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I know what you mean actually I'm also seeing someone then I also feel a bit down like but even though even though like I don't really talk about it like ya I do worry about like what what I'm whether I'm doing enough at the moment kind of thing ya so I think is understandable what you feel I've totally get it ya
ya I get it
(mm)
(um) actually <malay>macam</malay> I just told him I am exploring something new [lah] while because like at the same time also (um) learning like <malay>macam tengah belajar</malay> new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so <malay>macam</malay> I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
(um)
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything [lah] like I can pay for my own things like I <malay>ada</malay> savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that [lah] like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like <malay>ada ada</malay> like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
(mm) ya
[oh]
ya
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace [lah] it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> it you make you look forward to <malay>nak pergi kerja</malay> you look forward to seeing them
[oh] [oh]
okay
[oh] okay
[oh]
ya #irritatingnya#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
then <malay>dia orang dia orang tak bayar</malay> (hmm)
[oh] that sucks

okay actually I <malay>ada kawan yang</malay> just started the early childhood she also was from engineering <malay>punya</malay> field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so <malay>kalau</malay> you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about <malay>dia punya</malay> program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
ya
can later I will give you her number ya then (um)
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so <malay>dia</malay> totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not <malay>macam</malay> out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya <malay>macam</malay> some ya ya ya that feeling what's <malay>segan</malay> to us just sometimes that feel that way <malay>tapi</malay> actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience <malay>macam</malay> whatever you have experience [lah] then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
then can maybe made you look forward to something better and maybe she can even recommend you to her company you know you never know
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least <malay>macam</malay> [lah] like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry [lah] then at least you roll one out

yup I'll text her later I'll text her later than I'll give you her number she's a very nice person ya
can you hear me can you hear me
[oh] I hope our recording is not affected recording is not wifi [kan]
(hmm) ya
[oh] I
okay okay
(hmm) ya
(hmm)
[oh]
okay okay
ya
ya ya she's very nice she's very nice ya
so actually I met her from (um) like a random <malay>punya</malay> part time job also then <malay>macam</malay> we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and <malay>macam</malay> after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya <malay>macam</malay> random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
ya okay so maybe hopefully after that it will help you [lah] I just wanted to like try help you a little bit but don't know whether it will help ya
ya
no worries okay
I don't know I think <malay>macam</malay> I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of <malay>macam</malay> thought into it it's not <malay>macam</malay> a fleeting decision like I was really <malay>macam</malay> very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my <malay>punya</malay> bosses all like understand [lah] like my work was difficult [lah] like I was facing a difficult <malay>punya</malay> client <malay>macam</malay> everyday <malay>hentam</malay> on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
so
at the same time <malay>macam</malay> as in like I said [lah] because I had <malay>macam</malay> savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important [lah] like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
ya so like
(hmm) important to save [ah]
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing [lah] ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing [lah] like take a break and not work kind of thing
(hmm) so
(hmm)
(hmm)
good for you [lah]
sure
(hmm)
[oh] no
(hmm)
why
[oh] probation [ah] <malay>macam sekarang sekarang</malay> is probation period is it
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> contract what the contract say
then you actually you can demand for that you know
(uh)
no but your contract said you have so actually <malay>macam</malay> you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then <malay>dia orang tak</malay> they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
(hmm)
you mean [oh]
that sucks though
(hmm) ya that ya
[oh] ya
you have do you have siblings like you <malay>ada kakak</malay> or <malay>adik</malay> like
[oh] only one <malay>kakak</malay> [lah]
!huh! sorry [oh] see I see okay ya I'm also not <malay>tak tak</malay> not close to my siblings my elder siblings too <malay>pasal dia orang dah</malay> marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common [lah]
(hmm)
so (um) I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like <malay>macam</malay> sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
ya
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that (hmm) that is so important <malay>macam</malay> not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tapi macam</malay> like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to <malay>macam</malay> cafe where <malay>dia punya</malay> server is so friendly like <malay>dia</malay> bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending <malay>dia punya</malay> food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too
but ya hopefully you find something that makes you happy that's quite as in even if it's not happy doesn't make you unhappy ya
or maybe like if you do need help to like have you consulted like polyclinic to get referral to doctors
[oh] you have already that's good because I have friends who did the same
no what's that
(hmm)

<malay>macam</malay> I more better but then actually you not that better [lah]
okay
you ask me what question you want to ask
you you
okay
<malay>kita</malay> party [lah] [sia]
I think I think right I think
I think <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita macam ape eh</malay>
<malay>kau tak payah kerja kalau</malay> we don't have to work right
and then
what do we do I <malay>rasa</malay> we enjoy
<malay>kita</malay> party
<malay>kita macam buat hal masing masing</malay> I think we will achieve our dreams [ah]
I think that is for sure <malay>macam</malay>
we don't need to worry about
bill bill <malay>yang nak bayar ni semua</malay>
you know
so if you don't have to work
<malay>kalau</malay> we don't have to work then don't basically <malay>macam</malay>
the only reason why we work is <malay>nak dapat duit kan</malay>
so if
we we don't need to get the money to pay our bills then
I think
we will just
<malay>buat hal masing masing [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
we achieved our dreams like we <malay>macam</malay> finally enjoy life why what what I would say
then maybe the whole world won't be so capitalistic
yeah
consumerism consumerism
yeah
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>tak ada makna</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam tak ada makna</malay> meaningless [lah]
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
<malay>tak ada</malay> challenges [ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kalau</malay>
like if you drop
everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
risk
that is so true though
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think for me
(um) I only risk
failures [lor]
[oh] I risk time
basically time [lah] I think <malay>yang</malay> the most issue for my
side is time because I feel like
<malay>macam tak cukup masa gitu</malay>
because I'm really so old you know like twenty four
<malay>abeh macam</malay>
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like [oh] nothing but to me I <malay>rasa macam</malay> twenty four is like [oh] my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I <malay>kena kahwin kena beli rumah</malay>
and you need to like
like
you know you have to get your dreams in order basically [lah]
so macam like
to me the only factor that I <malay>rasa</malay> that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gagal lagi</malay>
like (ugh)
it's so sad right
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> they still like if to me that those are like lucky people <malay>macam dorang macam</malay>
<malay>bertuah</malay> [lah] to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though <malay>dorang</malay> [dah] macam tua tua gitu macam</malay> forty plus <malay>tapi macam masih dapat</malay>
<malay>dapat buka</malay> apprenticeship
<malay>dapat</malay>
<malay>buat ni semua</malay> like
not everybody is that lucky I guess
(mmhmm) hard work is also another thing
(mmhmm)
but at the same time <malay>kalau asyik asyik kena</malay>
like do you think you would actually have the strength to like not give up anymore
<malay>macam</malay> like if you always like you know <malay>kalau</malay> you always work work hard <malay>je asyik asyik</malay> work hard <malay>abeh lepas itu macam</malay>
<malay>macam tak ada tak ada</malay> luck like people don't like it's just not your <malay>bidang</malay> [lah] it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try <malay>masak</malay> you try restaurant
retail <malay>abih</malay> you try [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [ah] engineering <malay>abih lepas itu</malay>
you try hairstyling also
and then you find out that like [eh] you found nothing like everything in the world you try and that like
you don't know you <malay>nak buat apa</malay>
(mmhmm)
true [lah]
at the same time also you feel like like
(err) there's also there's always new things to discover I guess
so <malay>macam</malay> you'll never run out of things to like
explore and try
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah]
what you say <malay>ada ada</malay> sense
if you had three wishes
what would you wish for
no but if you cannot do that
<malay>kalau</malay> you cannot <malay>minta</malay> for like more wish
okay so my first wish I <malay>rasa</malay> I would be eternally rich
I will I will ask for a never ending fortune
so I can <malay>beli</malay> anything that I want
you [eh]
ya ya ya
world peace !oof!
now you making me feel inadequate
inadequate
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my second wish
(um)
probably that
we may be looked as equals
<malay>macam</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> treated as human beings [lah]
at least <malay>macam</malay> in terms of salary in terms of of the will
<malay>kaum lelaki tengok kita</malay> basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
yeah basically
but the thing is <malay>memang betul</malay> [lah] <malay>darjat wanita</malay> [dah] <malay>naik</malay> [kan] <malay>memang tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>di islam tapi</malay>
<malay>entah macam kadang kadang kawan kita macam</malay>
tradition you know tradition sucks man
they suck balls
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since <malay>kita kecil sampai sekarang</malay> [dah] <malay>besar</malay> [pun]
<malay>kalau kita nak macam</malay> you know like <malay>cakap</malay> example like wedding my friend
like ask ask my friend was like saying that like [oh] [ah]
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because [ah] <malay>suami dia</malay> is <malay>apa itu anak seorang</malay>
like he's the only child so
they want to <malay>buat besar besar</malay> because they are only going to have one wedding ever
<malay>so macam</malay>
<malay>kan membazir</malay> and then like to her she feels like she don't need [lah] because most of the people she won't she won't even <malay>kenal</malay>
you know
and then at the same time <malay>macam</malay> in at the same time you so you follow [lah] if you <malay>mampu ke tak betul tak</malay>
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
yeah
just the
just how society
look at us
basically [ah]
like their requirement to like [oh] for women to be considered
(uh) ideal matches to be <malay>kahwin</malay>
to be married off
and then they don't put the same on guys
must be soft spoken must be so <malay>macam</malay>
but
like girly you know you have to like
be
motherly figure
cannot cry cannot be emotional
you have to be strong
(uh huh)
society is definitely the problem
ok then your second wish
meaning
(mmhmm)
(mm)
basically you just don't want to regret
like you just want to like be confident of your choices no matter what you take no matter what you what no matter what you did
is it
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
but I think for me [leh] (uh)
so far no matter even if I had bad choices right I feel like I am generally pretty satisfied with whatever I choose [lah]
like
I mean ok like it when it comes to
my exes then that is another different story [lah]
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there <malay>macam</malay> like
is a is a lesson to learn
yeah I like like went through whatever <malay>yang kesakitan</malay> all this <malay>nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam</malay>
is at the same time <malay>macam</malay> you do have like some of this
regret <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap</malay> yes <malay>kat dia macam</malay>
but at the same time if I didn't go through that I feel like
I wouldn't be this kind like I wouldn't be myself I wouldn't be the person that I am today
so to me I don't feel
an ounce of regret
in any of my decision so far
okay for the third wish <malay>kan</malay>
<malay>kita kena</malay> make it a fun [one]
<malay>kita kena macam</malay> as <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi macam like</malay>
like <malay>jangan</malay> serious <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
because like that okay I think my third wish I would
[ah]
wish for
the skills of
every cook in the world
so <malay>kirakan</malay> I can <malay>masak</malay> any <malay>makanan</malay> that I want
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
I also didn't know like it was one of my choices [lah] for me to to
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to <malay>ikut</malay> recipe
I for me I don't really <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't <malay>macam ikut one tablespoon
(uh) one
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I <malay>tak ikut</malay>
yeah
you know I mean <malay>agak agak</malay> is like fun [leh] it's like (oo) you know you are making a portion or you like making something like [oh] it's a hit and miss like [oh] if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more <malay>gula</malay> and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like <malay>macam</malay> like that time I <malay>masak sambal tumis telur</malay> [eh] <malay>sambal tumis</malay> like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs <malay>dengan</malay>
sotong ball
so I literally right
<malay>buat sambal tumis tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>tak ada bawang merah tau</malay> like there's no onions
so I decided to use <malay>bawang putih</malay>
and to me because mummy <malay>kata</malay>
<malay>bawang putih</malay> is like a good alternative and also like you know <malay>bawang putih</malay> is more flavorful <malay>macam kalau</malay> you <malay>masak nasi goreng</malay> if you don't have <malay>bawang putih</malay> it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important [lah] basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much [lah] because you can literally <malay>rasa</malay> the garlicky taste
and then I did <malay>macam lada kering</malay>
and all that jazz and then after that I <malay>tengah masak kan</malay>
and then I was just like I feel like <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>bawang putih punya</malay> taste <malay>macam</malay> still overpowering you know
so I <malay>letak</malay> sugar and then it was like (uh)
doesn't really hit the spot
and I try to put a sauce and I try again and it was like okay okay is kinda there
and after that I put stock because I mean makes the world go round
so I put then I put <malay>kicap</malay> and then I put (uh) it was like a it was like a frenzy [ah] it was like a
like a carnival like basically <malay>macam</malay>
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just <malay>campak kat dalam</malay>
(mmhmm)
yes imagine you ask me for <malay>rendang</malay>
I can cook any <malay>rendang</malay> you want <malay>rendang</malay> #johor# <malay>rendang</malay> #penang# <malay>rendang</malay> #sarawak#

apparently after we left after we leave the <malay>punya</malay> mall right then then I was okay already then I <malay>rasa lapar</malay> then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay [lah] let's go eat <malay>dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa</malay> like some
<malay>kedai kedai kat bawa gitu</malay>
you know that I think that was like
it's not really a good thing but it's something that I remembered

but it's more of like glimpses all here and there
<malay>macam sikit sikit/malay> [lah] like
ya we don't remember the entire thing
but if it's a good memorable one right
I think
where mummy <malay>masak</malay> me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday

I feel like

let's think of stupid questions
what
[oh] baby baby
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
yeah
(mm) <malay>fikir fikir</malay>
good looks
(uh huh)
yeah that's true
that's true that's true ya ya I think for a guy I will take good looks because
I mean
<malay>buat apa kalau badan macam sedap gila tapi muka macam haprak</malay>
but that at the same time if you have if your body is fit your <malay>muka haprak</malay> but then your personality is nice then okay [lah]
and if you manage to <malay>macam</malay> you know capture me with your humor then
it's fine it's fine by me
you know
topic topic <malay>perbincangan</malay>
<malay>satu jam</malay>
okay
(um)
what is your favourite colour

red
what the hell
[oh] blue is it [ah] ya blue
then I was joking
no
what the
it's not yellow
no it's not yellow baby
it's pink
what do you mean I hated pink that's not me sorry I love pink with all of my heart it's just that this year I feel like I want to use a lot of yellow
cause yellow is a good energy <malay>punya</malay>
color
it it has sunny it has a happy joy up to it I don't want any negativity
yeah
like you look at yellow then you just like [oh] you know <malay>sedap mata memandang gitu</malay>
but like
yeah I I like pink I'm I'm a pink person
unusual
(mm)
to be
able to
<malay>entah eh</malay>
how unusual is unusual
[oh] my god that's gross
(um)
[oh] I think for me is to
control my period cycle
control your period pain
like my cramps
and my power is to just like okay
today I need to feel pain so I'll be like okay pain meter let's go to a hundred
and the next time I'll be like okay today I feel like I want to chill chill a bit
so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>turun</malay> a bit the pain threshold
yeah
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>sedih macam sedih nak mampus gitu</malay>
my super power would be able to
manifest anything that I want from thin air
from thin air
<malay>macam</malay> like if I want a sandwich I get a sandwich if I want airpods if I want a pair of airpods I get airpod if I want a laptop I get a laptop
if I want money I get money
<malay>apa</malay>
okay what I think like what if if I want to if I want to
if I want a condo I got condo
<malay>senang sikit</malay>
the troubles that comes through
that comes through
and resale and <malay>kahwin</malay> everything
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] you don't have to worry
I just think about it and is there I want it I got it I want it I got it
you [eh]
why
without what
why
<malay>nanti</malay> what if you <malay>jadi</malay> pervert <malay>ke apa</malay>
I mean true what if you don't want to be if you don't want if you want to go to places that people I mean isn't that like
something perverts would ask for
ya like
I think right if I have the power of invisibility right I will probably like look at people
like my greatest enemies right and then see what they're doing and then <malay>macam</malay> blackmail them
(oo) that's true I'm like you die today
[oh] my god yes

today you shall live
I shall not kill you

ya <malay>dia macam tak</malay> serious come on man you are the avatar man
you have the ability to control all four like
[oh] maybe I'll choose #toph# also
#toph#
ya the earth the earth girl the blind [one] her jokes everytime
her joke she's just like [eh] see and then it be like [eh] what I don't say anything then she's like ya
exactly
like her jokes are like one of a kind [lah] [seh] like

I need to rewatch the entire series because I am reading a lot of theories [eh] I don't understand
I mean I understand [lah] but like I want to like watch it and like be obsessed with it
tomorrow what are you doing
tomorrow is sunday what are you gonna do
you got some work to do
(oo)
ya same
same with me
!huh!
I <malay>rasa tak keluar tak tau ah</malay>
I think so
yeah definitely we have to do my work I have to re-upload my
I re-uploaded my first two decks already I'm working on my third deck
for so <malay>macam tinggal</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> monday I have to like upload
(err) five more
and I'm way behind to be honest
(mm)
I mean <malay>macam</malay> I have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but I'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have I'm far behind and I have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
and I'm only at deck three
everybody else <malay>dorang tak macam</malay> explore <malay>tau dorang macam</malay> just do one that one that one that one that one that so <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know how they can just like not explore [lah] I I like exploring I like to <malay>macam</malay>
yeah I like to <malay>macam</malay>
if I see something I want to develop a bit more and more and more <malay>macam</malay> you know let it let it branch out
I see it so it's gonna be this if I see this it's gonna be this so <malay>macam</malay>
it's a bit hard for me I guess
yup
cause it's sunday <malay>kan</malay>
tomorrow's national day
happy birthday Singapore
<malay>majulah Singapura</malay>
but I feel like this year <malay>macam</malay> I don't think they they should actually have
national day [seh]
exactly
ya the idea is just
<malay>merepek ah</malay> like who comes up with this stuff
like
like who would be appreciative of
hearing jet planes flying over
ya like are you dumb or you dumb like
fathom how dumb that idea is
it's so stupid
<malay>otak letak kat juboh</malay>
ya but at the same time and then like you you then <malay>dorang kata dorang nak</malay> do salute [eh] for nurses
ya but hello raise their pay
yeah they deserve more I mean like
instead of just
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus <malay>macam</malay> at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
cause I believe our healthcare system like earns a lot of money
especially nurses
yeah
exactly
worst [eh]
[oh] my god
[ah] vegetables
you know I don't like vegetables what are you on
#taugeh#
I think my my answer would be #taugeh# the worst thing to have buy one get one free is #taugeh#
I mean
why would anybody want more #taugeh#
like
that whole idea is just
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
!huh!
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
!wah! she power [seh]
no I don't think I'll become that kind of mother
hello I eat a lot okay
I eat fried potatoes
potatoes
!hey! I eat baby carrots
I eat lettuce
ya ya then I mean they're not raw or they are already cook is just that
you know
ya <malay>macam</malay> sausage all this <malay>kena potong potong kadang kadang pun</malay> I <malay>macam makan</malay>
like you cut right than you just sneak in a few slices
and that's what I will do
that's what I will do
[oh] my god I feel like eating corn beef you know corn beef
yeah yeah yeah
<malay>sedap kan</malay>
[a'ah] [seh]
ya but I guess I mean we're here for a good time not a long time
I mean that's my motto here for a good time not a long time so I'm just gonna enjoy whatever I have
whatever I can get whatever I can eat and not worry about the what not worry about the
percussion
repercussion
isn't percussion like a a music instrument
!oops!
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya repercussions later yes like diabetes or something like that I mean like I won't eat so sweet [lah]
what do you think about bubble tea
can you do you think you can live without bubble tea
a need
ya to me also like I can like live without bubble tea
[ah] actually also it's been like
two weeks since I had my KOI ovaltine macchiato
bubble tea
[oh] damn that was long
yeah I wanna eat
now I feel like drinking
yah
you weirdo
you need at least one bubble tea a month
that's fine
okay [lah] is it bubble tea or <malay>macam</malay> Boost
<malay>kan</malay> I think so I also prefer Boost
yeah especially the gym junkie cause you got protein
I like the protein
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
ya [lah] cause of the protein
I think this is where my extra mass also come from
but you know sometimes I like to just buy the kid size
because like I feel like the original is too much
ya then sometimes you just feel like like example <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> interview that time I <malay>gi</malay> interview then after that I just
want to buy boost tapi I don't want so big because I want to go for the interview but I want something small enough to like
drink it so I bought the kids one
and it was so nice it was so cute I like cute stuff
okay baby I think I want to sleep
!yay!
okay bye [lah]
bye

!woohoo!
let's go hello
(mmhmm)
okay but one question are you gonna answer it too
no
okay let's go
(mmhmm)
(oo)
I think that's a question where did you get them from
just random ya (um) I think if I were to follow my dreams what am I risking I think I will risk family time
family time is
crucial right
okay that's the thing cause if you asking about my dreams <malay>cita-cita saya nak pergi ke</malay> australia <malay>untuk</malay> continue my studies which actually I was supposed to do but then I did not cause family time I was thinking about <malay>keluarga masa dengan keluarga sangat</malay> important
a bit of both
<malay>pasal kalau ibu</malay> (um) <malay>susah sangat kalau dia nak lepaskan saya</malay> cause <malay>saya anak yang paling</malay> last
so for <malay>ayah</malay>
<malay>ayah</malay> is quite easy you know
he's just a guy that always ask us to do what we wanna do
you know but like when I was supposed to go <malay>saya</malay> not supposed to come back for like two or three years that's why you know the risk of family time is important to me so that's the thing that's the answer for that
how do I do
(oo)
so <malay>tak boleh yang</malay> typical <malay>macam</malay> invisible
(oo) <malay>tu susah</malay>
okay <malay>awak awak jawab dulu</malay>
ya
okay <malay>awak nak jadi macam</malay> spy kids [lah]
(mmhmm) <malay>masukkan makanan dalam</malay> oven <malay>terus</malay> boom <malay>dah siap</malay> is it
<malay>awak tak sangka</malay> [kan] <malay>tu jawapan saya saya tahu saya tahu</malay>
that's a good superpower
(oo)
saves time
ya
<malay>makanan yang ringkas</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah]
!wow!
I've never thought of that
as you got !wow! now after we think ya <malay>masa tengah fikir ni</malay>
<malay>apa jawapan saya</malay>
unusual
#allah# <malay>ada</malay> timing [eh] okay
(oo)
ten years ago <malay>saya dapat jumpa sekarang</malay>
[kan] <malay>yang benda tu dapat jumpa sekarang</malay> okay
<malay>saya akan dapat jumpa</malay>
<malay>gambar-gambar lama</malay>
ya <malay>pasal saya suka</malay> collect <malay>gambar-gambar lama</malay>
ya <malay>sama macam ibu</malay> collect collect collect
then I think
(uh) first few pictures would be my grandparents and then my parents nothing much cause I don't
think there will be a lot of things in the time capsule
<malay>pasal kecil benda tu</malay>
ten years ago (oo)
<malay>dua puluh tiga sekarang jadi</malay>
(mm) <malay>tiga belas</malay> ya
<malay>saya tengah</malay> secondary one
right
!wow!
!wow! ya that's a tough
like a period of time you know everybody has a tough period during secondary school especially sec one cause like dude
we did not alter our skirts did you remember we talk about this we did not alter
skirts we we don't know
ya
<malay>kita macam budak baik dulu</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>macam</malay> [jer] cause
[ah] cause after second year third year <malay>habis</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
I think that is peer pressure
[kan]
I think if I don't have like much friends last time
yes
<malay>sama-sama</malay> [lah] <malay>kita macam</malay>
<malay>nak buat kawan susah</malay> [lah]
cause you have like certain clans I don't know whether it it it happens in your school
since we're talking about school but like my school has a lot of clans
like the pretty one one side and then the people are one side so
I don't belong in any groups so that's a hard part sometimes I don't even eat just sit down in class just just
<malay>tak buat apa-apa pun</malay> ya <malay>pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai</malay> telephone
<malay>jujur</malay>
<malay>siapa yang tak pernah tidur dalam kelas</malay>
ya <malay>tapi saya tak boleh tidur</malay> often it's cause
(uh) student leader <malay>saya</malay> student leader
ya <malay>saya</malay> student leader
<malay>dalam sekolah</malay>
(oo)
[oh] you call it monitor in your school
<malay>tapi</malay> in your secondary school
class chair
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
they have different ya
(mmhmm)
I was that girl
I was that girl
no I [oh] ya I forgot we had the I forgot we had the blazer on
ya but for my school we call it (um) have to
we don't just have prefect we have like a two (uh) different roles
so there's like a student council and student leader
student leader is student leader you just do like basic (um) just make sure all the class are good and everything but student council which I was in we do a lot with discipline master
ya so for student (um) leader
if I'm not wrong we only had they only had (um) the badge but for mine I have the badge I have the tie the blazer
so ya coming from
<malay>sekolah yang paling tinggi</malay> cause my school is more of a like a music school
and we are good with (uh) literature so we really have to do good in both
ya
so ya
(mmhmm)
of course
(mm)
<malay>siapa yang suka</malay> first of all
<malay>siapa yang suka</malay>
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
like a stable right
ya
ya <malay>saya kena</malay> (um) bully about my looks
ya and that's why secondary school was the toughest
primary school was okay I would say
<malay>macam</malay> compared to primary and secondary secondary school
I prefer primary school just cause <malay>dia macam</malay> carefree at that point
right you <malay>macam tak kisah</malay>
<malay>pergi sekolah tak pergi sekolah macam</malay> it's okay
but secondary school like the pressure is on everything have to do good or else you have to repeat (um) sec four
except for school show cause like for our
time we had to go sec five
had to
ya had to but then
<malay>saya kecewakan keluarga saya</malay>
<malay>mengecewakan</malay>
<malay>cis</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya
(mm)
in school
(oo)
<malay>dalam sekolah apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>saya rasa</malay>
<malay>saya paling suka</malay> during <malay>saja</malay>
yes
<malay>makanan</malay> is
something else
simple <malay>makanan</malay> simple
like it's cause <malay>tak mahal</malay>
<malay>nak cakap murah pun tak murah sangat</malay> but
!wow!
<malay>kau pergi</malay> east [kan]
the best
(mmhmm)
<malay>warung</malay>
ya
ya
ya
<malay>ada benda dua dolar</malay>
yes I think that's my most memorable one
that's my answer
<malay>jawapan saya</malay> is the <malay>dua</malay> dollar
chicken wrap
<malay>dekat</malay> <malay>dah tak ada dah nak cakap innalillah pun tak boleh innalillah dah takde</malay>
[dah] <malay>tutup</malay> it's cause before I graduate I heard that (uh) they were running out of money to survive in that stall so they had to close the stall cause stall <malay>tu dengan</malay> bubble tea I <malay>ingat</malay>
ya bubble tea then they had to close and then they changed to like a random mini cafe with like that was after I graduate so
ya but that's for me but for you
the two dollars
<malay>saya tak</malay> fan
ya
<malay>itu yang belakang</malay> drink stall [eh]
[kan]
I just remembered it's behind the drink stall
(oo) ya
ya
fragrant
(oo)
<malay>saya terlupa</malay>
ya
the #ramen# the japanese #ramen# that's my number one
[ah] that's good #ramen# there's the
end stall that's why
ya I remember I asked them before maggi <malay>apa dia orang pakai</malay> just cause
<malay>nak</malay> try <malay>buat kat dalam kat rumah</malay>
<malay>tapi pernah buat rasa dia lain</malay>
<malay>macam tak boleh</malay> make it <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>saya rasa saya</malay> chef bob <malay>awak rasa</malay>
<malay>awak</malay> chef #wan# <malay>saya rasa saya tak mampu</malay>
but ya
that's the best one so two top two is
two dollar chicken wrap and also #kimchi# #ramen#
the beef
#ramen#
ya
ya
anything that is not generic to you you're like no I know you
and you know me <malay>apa-apa</malay> you <malay>kasih</malay> I I <malay>makan</malay> [jer]
I <malay>tak tanya apa benda saya makan</malay> [jer]
I mean
as long as halal
<malay>kadang-kadang pun saya tak tanya kalau benda tu halal ke tak</malay>
#inshallah# <malay>benda tu</malay> halal #inshallah# <malay>tu</malay> halal
okay
so for the bad podcast
(oo)
we're sticking to that [oh] my god ya
ya
(oo) <malay>soalan yang susah</malay>
!wow! sensitive question <malay>dia</malay>
sensitive
ya
perspectives
(mmhmm)
well we're talking about bullies remember just now we're talking about
(um) bullies in secondary school
well I was labelled as a boy
ya
okay cause
(uh) <malay>waktu</malay> secondary school [kan]
was number one for me
I did all the that are good sports to I have multiple
!wow! I know I am I <malay>macam macam-macam</malay> [lah] since [ah] <malay>macam macam macam dari</malay> primary school it's if primary school I
usually do sports and music I was in band and then I moved to volleyball netball softball
that's primary school itself
it's all that's
so that's that ya
(oo) don't get me started on secondary school but was much lower but like for
secondary school I did let me run through
<malay>saya tengah fikir balik apa saya buat dulu</malay>
[ah]
secondary school I my number one yes my number one all time is
(um) which if nobody knows what it means national police cadet corps
(uh) and then I also did aside for
volleyball netball floorball same [what] like primary school and then I also did tchoukball
tchoukball it's a I don't know whether a lot of people heard or not yes
tchoukball
it's like netball <malay>sama dia punya</malay> rules is <malay>sama macam</malay> netball
exactly the same <malay>cuma dia punya</malay> (um) the hoop is not the regular basketball hoop or netball hoop it's a trampoline like a vertical trampoline you have to throw it
bounce back to you you're supposed to not catch it it's the opponent who supposed to catch it to save the points
ya very complicated <malay>tapi saya buat</malay> and then I also did
a side of rugby during did everything
ya but like labels itself ya I was labelled as a boy
my voice
ya
the the topic is about bullies
but like ya bullies (uh) I remember one time
(um) <malay>benda ni saya tak akan lupa selama-lamanya</malay>
cause it's hard
I think I was in like secondary two or sec one
like early secondary school days
I <malay>nak beli air</malay>
cause it's recess time of course <malay>saya nak beli air</malay> so I <malay>pergi</malay> canteen <malay>seorang-seorang</malay>
<malay>beli air terus ada</malay> this random girl came
and then she just looked at me and I remember her face I remember her name until now
I'm just saying
but I remember her name until now I remember her face I saw her before actually okay but we're not gonna talk about that
but like (um) she like looked at me she's younger by the way
she's like I think it was sec three or something like that ya she's a junior
she just came then she looked me she was like
(um)
just wanna ask are you a boy before this
and then I look at her cause I <malay>macam</malay> lost [kan] <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>dia ni berbual</malay>
<malay>saya tengok dia</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> !huh! and then she was like cause you sound like a man are you sure you never went to surgery before
so for me at that point you know at that age we're like !huh! what did I do wrong
and she starts yes
so I just stared at her you know anyway we're at the drinks stall so the uncle heard everything
okay
this is not the first time she did to me
okay after that <malay>selepas itu dia buat lagi</malay> and <malay>lepas tu dia buat</malay> publicly
<malay>dia depan-depan orang</malay> you know but after she did that she walked away [eh] no and then she said (uh) pretty sure you did surgery before and she walked away
<malay>saya macam tercungap tu</malay> [kan] so I <malay>tak tahu nak buat apa</malay>
so I just <malay>masuk dalam kelas balik</malay> then I <malay>macam</malay> just doze off cause
I still have hours in school and I'm trying to like
forget what she said
ya and then as the day goes by it gets worse cause like I got bullied online last time <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ingat</malay> like myspace blogspot was a thing
but ya so people start posting my pictures online
and say about like how I act
I mean
ya
ya
<malay>abeh macam tadi</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] student
council you're the thing you're popular but
<malay>tak</malay> necessarily it's a good thing cause everybody knows you and they like to put things in each other's mouth just cause like I don't say it but they would say
that I say it you know so it's pretty tough to make friends
cause my own friends
like
kill me from the back
ya
so I learn everything
from the start about how
I wouldn't say adulthood is like cause <malay>kalau</malay> adulthood we don't usually care about people right
<malay>kita pergi kita bangun mandi pergi kerja balik</malay>
ya
if <malay>dia orang nak berbual dia orang nak berbual</malay> you know what I mean
but <malay>bila</malay> secondary school it's hard cause you have to
come back to school the next day and see the same people and
like you stay in school more hours than you are at work generally
people at work don't care about you
there's nothing about ya
people are there to maybe get money
you know different reasons but for school it's just school people don't have other reasons
so that's a hard part
label with
!wow!
[orh]
<malay>soalan apa susah lagi</malay> <malay>saya tak tahu macam mana nak fikir</malay>
<malay>lepas ni ada rambut putih macam mana</malay>
!wow!
one wish
I would say
just give myself confidence <malay>pasal kalau pasal saya</malay> insecure
whatever people say about me I tend to believe it's true
like you're a boy you are you are like you act so rough
you are this you are that or you
are that friend
as people like to say you know I mean
and only if I had a bit of confidence to just kick out my insecurity <malay>saya rasa macam</malay> everything is gonna be okay
I will go through it you know
ya
no <malay>saya pun tak tahu nak cakap apa</malay>
ya
I think I never think of what you
want to think of it's cause I tried to stand up for myself but then again cause of confidence I tend to be like
(uh) <malay>suka hati apa orang nak cakap saya percaya apa awak cakap</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yes
everything is <malay>susahnya soalan awak</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>bosan</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
<malay>soalan</malay>
<malay>kalau tak perlu cari duit duit datang dari mana</malay>
ya
<malay>tapi duit ada</malay>
I've been talking
[oh]
have to work for the money it's what you're saying
(oo)
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>agak bosan</malay> cause you're not content
like you have no
eight to five job to go to right (oo)
what are humans catered to do
travel I think
but (oo)
just think about the human traffic here and there
and there's no limit like I think work is what limit you
you're like okay [ah] I only have like a week okay I want to plan everything right
cause I have to go back to work the next day I think that's what we are meant to be doing
but if we have no work
that's like a life of a retired person
I would say
they do whatever they wanna do use the money
(uh) plan their day but there's no rush which is a good thing
cause there is no time limit for it anything that you wanna do
cause we are not
(um) you don't have any commitment to something
so <malay>dia</malay>

<malay>sebulan tak makan</malay>
okay
(mmhmm)
in specific
(mmhmm)
generally
drama
<malay>itu awak</malay> everything that you have been saying the genre it's you
it's you I
(mm) you <malay>tahu</malay> I I <malay>tak suka</malay> movies <malay>sangat</malay>
I'm not a movie person I cannot commit to any episodes actually
but if I have to choose romance is me
ya romance is me
<malay>romantis</malay>
I like romance
<malay>tak tahu saya cuma saya suka</malay> falling in love the whole part of
like you get to know the person you fall in love you get a heartbreak fall in love just repeating the cycle that's me I really like it anything you <malay>tahu</malay> (um) nicholas sparks movies <malay>macam macam gitu</malay> favourite <malay>saya</malay>
<malay>saya dah tengok</malay>
movie <malay>dia banyak kali</malay>
<malay>saya tak bosan</malay>
<malay>tak bosan</malay> just
[oh] you know what a good movie that I never get bored of even like after ten years twelve years
is <malay>cerita</malay> white chicks
ya
<malay>itu</malay> favourite
I remember script <malay>dia semua</malay>
no really
no joke ya
I'm like a
hardcore fans of white chicks I heard they coming out the second one but
they say twenty twenty [kan]
twenty twenty hasn't been that great
but you know
anyway ya your turn
since you've been asking me
your genre
(mm)
but <malay>tak tak macam seram ke</malay>
that's the thing I don't like to watch
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
we're not alone
of course
ya
you know I love that ya
(mm)
what's the craziest (um) <malay>cerita paling</malay>
<malay>yang seram</malay> I wouldn't say <malay>seram</malay>
but something that really shook you up
[oh] ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
money
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
but generally in life
I like to think that
anything can exist
as long as you prove me like
the opposite then I still believe it exists
<malay>konon macam</malay> alien <malay>ke apa ke mana tahu masih ada tapi kita tak pernah nampak</malay>
you know what I mean
<malay>tak semestinya kalau kita tak nampak dia takde</malay>
that's why as long as it prove to me
that whatever my thought is it's wrong
it doesn't exist then sure
but for now I believe in anything
anything
ya
!wow! <malay>kita tengok banyak cerita</malay> zombie [tau]
apocalypse
how
[ah]
ya
infected
<malay>soalan awak</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
(um)
<malay>manusia</malay>
!wow!
everything is it's a circle of life you know how we started is how we end
so I think I don't like to think this kind of things <malay>saya tak suka saya benci fikir pasal gini</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> anxiety [tau] ya cause
overthinking ya
ya let's not talk about that part but (um) how would we end humankind
I think virus <malay>macam sekarang</malay>
<malay>sekarang kita</malay> COVID [jer] [kan]
there's COVID pandemic thing already making people killing people I would say cause it's in india the stats are getting higher and higher
although in singapore they only say like <malay>macam</malay>
numbers are going down and stuff like that but
it's not gonna go down to zero we're not like vietnam or something was it vietnam
like the the first country that went zero
all I know is like ya taiwan taiwan that's the one ya
I'm so sorry <malay>saya tak pernah saya tak boleh fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang tapi</malay> ya taiwan went to zero like really quick
but like how long could that last
and how long could this (um) virus itself
exist so I think humankind human itself
would be extinct due like a virus
cause it's gonna start killing yourself like softly !wow!
it's gonna kill us slowly
ya it is actually
gonna kill us slowly cause we are finding for
a cure
you know but I have
I have faith
cause if cancer can have its cure any virus can have its cure you know
a little stress
<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] ya ya
(oo) fun fact we only know twenty percent if I'm not wrong twenty percent of what's in the ocean can you imagine eighty percent left
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
and find ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
actually we did though remember <malay>dulu kalau</malay> (uh) <malay>ada</malay> SARS
<malay>tapi</malay> SARS <malay>tak teruk macam gitu</malay> although <malay>enam tahun</malay> [kan] if I'm not wrong is it six years we had to go through but it wasn't like the whole world
it's not mandatory
ya although even (uh) during the haze period it wasn't mandatory it wasn't right
I think also adding on to like how
human would end and stuff
climate change
cause I <malay>rasa</malay>
(um) whatever we put into the world is what is being given back so when we put like a lot of (um) like
a lot of burning and everything generally
it's gonna brings back to us cause we're like we are breathing the same air as what we burn ya so ya even the icebergs are melting
so
even the bears are
killing themselves cause they know they couldn't survive in
right so
a lot of things could lead up to that
there's a lot of what ifs
yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
or <malay>yang bagus</malay>
ya <malay>awak ni pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>buat soalan macam gini</malay>
(uh) <malay>saya rasa</malay>
<malay>apa yang saya boleh buat</malay>
is
(hmm)
if only I have like a good platform cause I feel like every
every individual has its voice
that's cause we don't have a platform I wouldn't say the platform is famous being famous cause people with fame
has a lot of power
so ya
instagram ya that's it but if I can have
influence over at least a hundred people
I would have a platform where the people my age are not even aware of this like they
everything so lightly
cause <malay>untuk kita macam tak ganggu kita asal kita nak kena fikir pasal benda gini</malay>
you know
it doesn't find us now so
so I think
it's to create a platform where (um)
one should know
whatever they do whatever they think of
matters now
cause it's what like even the
government in any country has said
like the young people are the voice of the future
so we have to do something about it now
instead of just following through
you know
(mmhmm)
for the rest of my life
<malay>makan yang sama selama-lamanya</malay>
!wow!
<malay>awak lucu</malay> [lah] (um) <malay>akhir hayat</malay>
(um)
<malay>awak jawab dulu saya kena fikir</malay> I'm a foodie
okay
shoot
meat
<malay>apa daging</malay> just <malay>daging</malay>
<malay>daging</malay> steak
steak !wow!
taste <malay>awak mahal</malay>
everything
<malay>awak pandai</malay> [lah]
ya
boil
(oo) [oh] ya
ya
I think
<malay>saya pilih ikan</malay>
<malay>awak dah cakap gitu saya tukar jawapan saya</malay>
<malay>sebenarnya saya nak cakap</malay> pasta <malay>tapi saya macam fikir pasal diri sendiri pula</malay>
[a'ah] [eh]
[ah] <malay>saya buat</malay> pasta
<malay>awak buat daging</malay>
<malay>sedih nah</malay> <malay>tapi sedih juga kalau hari-hari</malay>
<malay>makanan sama tapi saya rasa macam ikan</malay>
okay <malay>awak pilih daging saya pilih ikan</malay>
both <malay>boleh</malay> steam
<malay>boleh</malay> grill <malay>boleh macam-macam</malay>
<malay>macam cara kita</malay> [kan] chef #wan# <malay>dengan</malay> chef bob
okay
<malay>apa punya</malay> restaurant <malay>ni</malay>
karma
<malay>kifarah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal kita</malay> get
ya
what goes around comes around
(oo) <malay>kifarah apa</malay>
<malay>kifarah</malay> [kan] <malay>dalam bahasa kita kifarah</malay>
(uh) <malay>saya rasa rasa</malay>
(oo) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] cause
we always tend to think the best of yourself
<malay>betul tak</malay>
you <malay>tak akan fikir buruk pasal tentang tentang diri</malay> you <malay>sendiri</malay>
you confirm <malay>cakap macam</malay> you <malay>baik dengan orang macam gini tapi saya rasa</malay>
<malay>sebaik kita ada buruk</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak</malay>
[oh]
<malay>tapi tu ada sebab</malay>
[oh] karma
<malay>saya rasa</malay>
<malay>jawapan yang</malay>
typical straightforward that everybody does it don't lie and say you never done it before
it's when you could help someone but you did not just cause you're
too lazy or too tired
you're just like
ya so
so I think that's my answer
<malay>saya buka</malay> main door
it's it's the time I didn't invest on someone when I had the time
when I had the choice I would say
the choice to put my time invest my time in helping someone and I did not
I think I <malay>buka</malay> I think a few times !chey! <malay>nak cakap saya baik</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi tak</malay> [lah]
I think ya
yours
<malay>dia fikir pasal tu pula</malay>
ya
understanding you
what you give to your parents
I wouldn't say disobedience though
ya
ya
[oh] you're talking like a part
I wasn't thinking about I was thinking of opening the lid at the same time
ya
ya
that's a good one
cause I always think to
to like with parents there's a thin line between respecting and being like I wouldn't say rude but like somewhat disrespectful
but I think with your son you're doing good
ya you're doing good right
ya
ya
actually understanding though
people get tired
so I think my dish
is reasonable
the time is reasonable
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
!wow!
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(oo)
[oh] we're talking about
good body or body or good looks right
we're not talking about generally like physically
for boys right we're not talking about with pairs
I want to say good looks <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>awak nampak</malay>
like <malay>macam</malay> very presentable
<malay>kalau</malay> presentable <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>badan yang sihat</malay>
I'd prefer (oo) <malay>susah kalau diri sendiri</malay> I prefer <malay>badan sihat</malay>
of course
<malay>saya sekarang</malay> [jer] <malay>jalan tercungap-cungap</malay>
<malay>saya muda tapi badan macam dah orang tua gitu</malay>
so I think I would prefer
good body
ya good body
<malay>kesihatan kesihatan</malay> is everything
if like you're not healthy reflects bad on your looks
I would say cause looks
you <malay>nampak macam</malay> you <malay>muda tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>jalan sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>dah penat</malay>
what's the point
what's the point ya
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>asyik nak main</malay> [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya
it only helps during parent teacher meeting [jer]
ya <malay>mak</malay> you <malay>muda</malay> [eh]
ya
you know health is wealth
ya
!wow!
ya
I know what you gonna say <malay>saya dah tahu dah apa awak cakap</malay>
<malay>dalam</malay> partner <malay>awak cari apa</malay>
[oh] no <malay>apa</malay>
good one what did I do that I'm not doing now
what am I supposed to do
that I'm not doing is eating I've been eating <malay>macam-macam saya makan</malay> [lah] <malay>saya tak</malay>
<malay>saya tak tengok</malay> portion <malay>apa saya</malay> just <malay>makan</malay>
ya <malay>siapa kisah</malay>
<malay>saya makan</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>ada macam-macam baru makan</malay>
<malay>nanti seminit lagi saya</malay> (um)
find like
something to munch
just cause I want to keep my mouth busy
when I'm supposed to keep my body busy
to exercise <malay>tapi nawaitu saya</malay> is to exercise
<malay>saya nak bersenam saya betul saya nak bersenam</malay>
yes
really hard but ya
<malay>awak buat kelakar sekarang</malay>
<malay>saya</malay> gain weight
<malay>saya tahu awak saya kenal awak saya</malay> gain weight like crazy
like it's just cause I'm small
<malay>badan saya kecil dengan saya nak cakap saya tak tinggi tak tinggi sangat</malay> [lah] but
<malay>sedang-sedang sahaja badan tapi kalau saya</malay> step on the weighing scale
I've never ever hit like
fifty five
but after I know you
I'm like fifty five <malay>apa ni saya macam</malay>
<malay>ini</malay> weighing scale <malay>yang salah ke saya yang bersalah</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya
no I'm blaming the fact that I'm happy
like whatever is on the scale doesn't matter cause previously I was like a
exercise freak
no I wasn't
I wasn't
ya so I had to make it like a certain number every month
like I have to stay that number
I have to be fit
ya
cause I feel like being fit is what makes me happy
I feel
but after
being in like work
not that I'm not neglecting my body but it's like I feel like happier already
like eating it makes me happy not like stress eating stress eating is different but it's ya but like previously I was like an exercise freak I have to exercise every single day
fives times a day no like five times a week not five times a day that's too much
like in a day I have to exercise three hours more than three hours
in the gym for that long
so
after that I stop
and I feel like it wasn't a need anymore
cause I was just forcing myself to do it and stay like a number below fifty
below fifty is what I always go for
but that wasn't happy
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>saya rasa ada macam cara nak</malay>
prove the fact that you're healthy
there's different ways
some people will find like (um) the way you eat or
the number of hours you exercise or
just from walking
people would define it as five minute walk and you're okay building the same that means you're healthy depends
but so far
good body
it doesn't matter to me just health
just health ya
for your partner when you look like that
if the answer is opposite
my answer is obvious [lah]
<malay>gabung</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>jalan dengan dia</malay>
<malay>kawan-kawan dia macam</malay> [oh] my god #huda#
<malay>semua nak</malay> [seh]
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [eh]
so you <malay>nak</malay> maid [lah]
or is it you <malay>nak pembantu rumah</malay>
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
!wow!
!wow!
are you talking about me
cause that's how I feel
<malay>saya rasa macam gitu</malay>
cause <malay>muka saya dah kering jadi saya macam</malay> insecure <malay>sikit</malay>
ya of course
(mm)
<malay>saya tak nak jadi</malay> materialistic
ya but any I feel like I want the money
or a house
ya or house
for me it's hard to choose one
there's only one right
ya so money or house
ya
ya just
money is cause I don't want ya
if I don't want to be materialistic but like somehow
people say like money can't buy happiness
but it helps a lot
of course and you know it helps a lot
at times ya at times over like buying something for yourself doesn't make you necessary happy
but just giving it to people is
self amazing ya
ya
easier ya
(mmhmm)
ya
it makes everything easier
so that's what I would wish for
ya
a house
(mmhmm)
ya
like a space is what you need
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya
I think you just wanted space for so long
just your own privacy cause privacy matters you know like somehow
not saying that you don't want to be around family but like
privacy
is what we need at this age
cause we've been through like go to work and it's too much
you just want to be home and you want to be lazy
just to recharge
ya
<malay>saya rasa pasal dengan</malay>
<malay>awak lihat kawan-kawan sekeliling</malay>
<malay>awak rasa macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia orang ada ni</malay>
<malay>saya tak ada</malay>
or <malay>dia orang ada ni saya tak ada</malay>
although <malay>awak ada apa yang dia orang tak ada awak tak akan</malay>
think of it that way
always think what you don't have
cause if you always feel like you're content
you're not gonna progress and progress is like a big thing
so ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
patience
ya
ya
both
for the thirteen just now I would say like the confidence

hello hello [eh] hi
what's good
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah] you know got this (uh) [oh] god
got this like you know very tired stay at home
finally [dah] holiday <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] so <malay>boleh lepak</malay> at home and (uh)
just main computer <malay>lepak keluar dengan</malay> family ya
I'm quickly
how about you
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] [ah] you never you never do anything interesting you know like
go go to any (uh) theme park or like <malay>pergi</malay> beach <malay>ke pantai</malay>
theme park that [one] got the universal studios singapore
<malay>banyak benda</malay> [pe]
got #sentosa# beach [ah] the #siloso# beach all can go there to <malay>lepak lepak</malay>
the queue <malay>kat sana panjang tak</malay>
(mm)
women who who who
[oh] my god and then then <malay>sekarang sekolah macam mana masih kat (uh) <malay>masih kat rumah juga</malay>
[oh]
ya actually that [one] [sia] the
(uh) what work (uh) work from home and like all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard [lah] because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
<malay>susah sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> call call <malay>cikgu cikgu ini semua</malay> like
<malay>leceh</malay>
more like like usually you know when you go to the class then you like <malay>kenal</malay> all the <malay>muka muka</malay> of all the <malay>cikgu</malay>
then you can
<malay>macam berbual berbual sikit</malay>
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on Microsoft teams or like Skype or like [what] or they use Zoom [ah]
Zoom
it's like a bit awkward [ah] because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
ya it's like it's like you <malay>berbual</malay> with like some
<malay>orang yang tak kenal</malay> [kan] then <malay>susah nak berbual</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> like
you don't know the name don't even know their
who they are you don't know their face also sometimes like especially like first day of school that time
I <malay>tak kenal</malay> anyone
like not even the profile picture [dah] <malay>ada dia orang belum letak lagi</malay> you know
so I don't even know anyone
fishing
ya because like when you don't understand like you have to email the teacher
then like you have to wait for the teacher to respond all
then like issue in class like you just can just say [eh] teacher how to do this [one]
you know
[oh] god but then now that at home right
during class all I keep watching Tik Tok [ah] then

then <malay>selepas itu</malay> I go to
<malay>mana</malay> [ah] nak pergi</malay> all the way until like #bukit panjang#
then after that <malay>selepas itu</malay> like I cycle here cycle there [ah] everywhere <malay>mana mana selepas itu</malay> like just <malay>jalan jalan</malay> [ah] happy happy [jer] <malay>umpa kawan ke</malay>
ya
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
because like
(uh) that time during (uh) lockdown <malay>tak ada orang kat road</malay> [pe] <malay>jalan jalan</malay>
so like just cycle cycle [jer] [ah] <malay>orang orang</malay> then just
<malay>tak ada orang nak kacau</malay>
then <malay>kau buat apa</malay> since (uh)
(um)
confirm your intern also work from home then <malay>selepas itu ada banyak benda nak buat</malay>
(mm) what what what kind of activities is inside your morning routine

nowadays superpowers would be useful
ya ya then
[oh] my god Animal Crossing
it's been a while since I touch that game
then that time I go buy the Switch with you right
ya like I buy before during the circuit breaker period
ya I buy like how much [ah] six hundred plus dollar then I buy with that game the Diablo three

I never played the Diablo three I think it became like what I buy I buy for
eighty five dollars then after that I never even like
I never even play that much like I only played it like maximum like fifteen times

<malay>untuk</malay> for like
<malay>berapa</malay> like <malay>sembilan puluh</malay> dollar <malay>lebih</malay>
then actually I spent almost one hundred dollars on like Animal Crossing for no reason
ya
it was a bit sad [lah] but then
[dah] [dah] <malay>beli</malay> [kan] <malay>nak buat apa</malay>
damn you should play it
[oh] my god you just now just saw you say miss #bae# right like miss #bae# from our secondary school
then you reminded me of like secondary school [sia] I haven't been to like visit secondary school
why you don't want
[dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak berbual dengan cikgu cikgu melayu</malay> all
like it's been it's been awhile since we talk with them
ya [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak berbual</malay> then like <malay>macam</malay> you see other than <malay>cikgu dia baik juga</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan kita orang</malay>
like most of them were quite nice to us
ya he wasn't he was just close to me
he he was the [one] I was I was the [one] I was of his first student
no I was his first student
first [one]
okay [ah] I might be the worst [ah] but like I'm I'm I'm the first
I'm the first at the best
ya no [lah] he was just a very nice teacher
and then actually like be without him right I think I already fail art
O O level
ya no because like actually before he came I was with mister #irman#
that teacher
then after that like (uh) I because he got too many students then after that everytime I ask him for help he will like put me aside you know because he you know like his his (uh) attitude [ah] he's like he would prefer to like (uh) (uh) give his attention to those who are better you know
he want to keep the A students A then after that like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> he
<malay>selepas itu diam diam</malay> I was like ignore [ah]
<malay>dia macam tak suka layan</malay> my my artworks then he <malay>tak nak</malay> really <malay>tolong</malay>
me out with my artwork
ya
then haiti
<malay>tak apa</malay> [ah]
<malay>selepas itu</malay> then like mister #shafrin# came
the person that came <malay>mabuk</malay>
he like he like one <malay>malaikat</malay> like that
for O level art I think I I wanted to do like some [oh] remember me <malay>beli</malay> the right then after that like I take pictures of the <malay>dia keras</malay>
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like (uh)
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what Studio Ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
no because it showed like <malay>macam</malay> the perspective of how a small person just as a big person would be
(um)
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
(uh) what [ah] it became like
I just did a photoshop [lah] of people like climbing onto the that was very old
[oh]
ya
and then I just made it like so it's like the was a forgotten toy you know the dead
and then below the bed
below the bed
ya then like below the bed then got like tiny people
then the tiny people were climbing onto the
you a tiny people
ya
so I just took some pictures of like people and then like I edited it into the
into the scene [lah] so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya [eh] I remember you were doing also [ah] but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
[oh] my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the
it's very hard to use your focus on your and your studies at the same time
ya
then like I also like <malay>jumpa</malay> a lot of <malay>pak cik</malay>
the <malay>selalu kata</malay> to me [ah] like
(uh)
<malay>selepas sekolah selalu</malay> just <malay>pergi</malay>
trail
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> like
it's (uh) <malay>satu jam</malay> cycle from <malay>rumah</malay> all the way back to
the trail then <malay>selepas itu</malay> from the trail <malay>pergi rumah tak sampai satu jam pon</malay>
<malay>selepas sekolah</malay> but then like
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic [kan]
I <malay>tak rasa</malay> like can <malay>boleh boleh buat benda mcam gini</malay> [ah] because <malay>nanti terlalu penat</malay> [ah] <malay>selepas selepas sekolah</malay> [dah] <malay>penat</malay> then <malay>selepas itu nak pergi</malay> cycle <malay>selepas</malay> <malay>selepas kayuh kayuh kayuh</malay> [dah] <malay>lagi penat</malay>
then <malay>selepas itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>hari hari selpas itu masih kena pergi sekolah juga</malay>
<malay>semakin penat</malay> [seh]
like that <malay>salah buat</malay>
ya
just <malay>penat</malay>
tired
even in english also I can say like tired [lah]
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me [ah] in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester I will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
like still <malay>masih tak</malay> [tau] [ah] <malay>ada rasa macam nak masuk jadi orang</malay> army [kan]
<malay>tapi selepas itu</malay>
<malay>macam takut</malay> [ah] <malay>takut kena dapat kerja merepek</malay> [ah]
it's
I don't know [ah] people here people always say [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if sign on [oh] later you
you <malay>kena</malay> you will <malay>kena banyak banyak</malay> [ah]
<malay>nanti tak tak</malay> enjoy you know
ya
but
but sadly <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] like engineering
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why I would rather go to army [ah] even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because #sui sui# in engineering
(mm) got chemical engineering
[oh] my god <malay>tapi</malay> ya earn and learn <malay>itu sekarang banyak orang tengah</malay> apply
my mum also <malay>kata</malay> like <malay>macam nak ambil juga</malay> [ah] it's like <malay>boleh</malay> upgrade skills but at the same time <malay>boleh belajar</malay> [eh] no <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>kerja</malay> and then and earn <malay>duit</malay>
you know
[ah]
[a'ah] <malay>gaji dia tak seberapa tapi</malay> it's
<malay>lebih bagus daripada tak ada apa apa terus</malay>
[ah] then <malay>selepas itu</malay> nowadays also
<malay>banyak orang tengah hilang kerja</malay>
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you [oh] we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of COVID you know
L <malay>banyak orang kena pecat</malay> so quite <malay>sedih</malay> though
ya then also like
you know that time I saw like Channel NewsAsia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
ya it's like quite sad like I know singaporeans like <malay>gaji</malay>
<malay>banyak juga</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like
<malay>tak seberapa</malay> [pe] like
one person like my friend I heard before he earn like [what] five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst [one] is the people who who already have high pay [lah] because their
their lifestyle is already like (uh) I have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> like if Tiba Tiba the [oh] <malay>gaji potong</malay> then like their lifestyle is still the same you know
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard [lah]
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
[eh] why gym close [ah] cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
ya <malay>rumah dia orang terlalu kecik</malay> [ah] then also <malay>tak boleh</malay> work out <malay>kat rumah</malay> [kan]
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> even if <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> work out <malay>kat rumah nanti mak dia orang kacau</malay> or like <malay>adik beradik kacau</malay>
[oh] my god talking about working out at home
you got see Channel NewsAsia
they were like showing like <malay>macam</malay> a got these people they were doing like Zoom workouts
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like Zoom workouts
but then the coach was originally like a
(uh)
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like Zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase [ah] then they people were like following him
I feel like it's good [ah] because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay [ah] obviously there's some limitations [ah]
but
ya he went to the extent
no [ah] because his house was too small like he he he showed (uh) showed the
like programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
so like <malay>selepas itu</malay> he just <malay>buat kat tangga</malay> [ah] <malay>kat tangga lebih banyak ruang</malay> [pe]
ya
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> also got the malay dance group
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the Zoom call
so basically they just individually <malay>semua</malay> like <malay>joget kat depan</malay> camera
savage love ya I don't know but then like
but then like they just <malay>joget</malay> at the camera individually but then like they did like their own solo part then there
it's quite cool [ah] because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun [ah]
you just open up the game that [one] [ah] <malay>yang ada</malay> Minecraft that [one] then you farm farm <malay>kat dalam</malay> game
<malay>sama juga</malay> [pe] like you
<malay>berkebun</malay>
[oh] my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren #tan# that [one] or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like [eh] you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside [ah] like what if what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
I know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like I don't I don't eat vegetable [sia] but I like the concept
ya <malay>tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>makan sayur rasa macam rumput gitu</malay> like
to me to to me like <malay>sayur semua rasa sama</malay>
it's like
<malay>but rasanya macam bila gigit daun</malay> then <malay>keluar air</malay>
<malay>rasa dia semua sama tak pernah tukar</malay> even <malay>kalau ada sambal</malay> [kan] <malay>sambalnya</malay> just <malay>tutup dia punya air</malay> like when I <malay>gigit</malay> into the <malay>sayur</malay> right <malay>masih rasa</malay> [eh] <malay>ini macam sayur macam daun keluar air</malay> then <malay>ada sambal itu</malay> [jer]
<malay>tak pernah rasa lain</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi sayur bagus untuk kesihatan</malay>
<malay>tak nak tak nak</malay>
<malay>tak suka sayur</malay>
<malay>tak suka sayur tapi suka</malay> earth so <malay>mesti</malay>
so must (uh) <malay>buat</malay> hydroponic <malay>gitu [lah]</malay>
yes
ya
and eating all the <malay>kambing</malay> the <malay>kambing semua makan rumput</malay> [kan]
<malay>rumput buat</malay> oxygen
<malay>saya makan kambing semua untuk</malay> save the earth
ya <malay>lebih rumput</malay> you know
(mm) but mutton taste so good
I know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
[oh] my god you know actually why I love hydroponics so much
I got tell you before last time when I primary school I was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion I had during [eh] during primary school
(um)
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like (uh) they showed (uh) around [lah] like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube [kan]
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
then <malay>macam</malay> very cool [lah] then <malay>selepas itu</malay> [kan]
I <malay>menang</malay> something
because <malay>dia orang buat macam ada kecil punya</malay> competition [ah] <malay>untuk macam bagi budak budak</malay> chance <malay>bawa balik benda</malay>
then after that I <malay>menang</malay>
I <malay>menang</malay> like a small <malay>pokok</malay> Ribena
ya
I think same thing like grape [ah] <malay>dia</malay> like mash mash mash
then after that <malay>dia orang macam</malay> just <malay>kumpul</malay> together then <malay>buat macam</malay> syrup
[a'ah]
ya
ya I think the moment they like boil and then after that they make <malay>macam</malay> like concentrate
then <malay>selepas itu dia orang campur dengan air</malay> syrup <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk buat yang kita</malay> buy <malay>itu</malay>
more thick
like more <malay>pekat</malay> [ah] I think I think confirm got like got like sugar inside like sugar syrup
to make it more thick
but ya then after that I I won the <malay>pokok</malay>
no <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>tanya</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) they just ask about the facts on the <malay>pokok</malay> [ah] like the hydroponic or like how how like I forgot [what] [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything [ah]
ya but then I don't know what happened to the Ribena plant [ah] I think my mum throw away already
I think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya I think so I don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like (uh)
actually I saw this one whole circuit
[oh] like hydroponic
it's like very cool I think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
ya
ya
ya [lah] because obviously like the plants <malay>pon</malay> constantly be like (uh) consuming
all the fish poop you know
and the fish will obviously get bored of the plants already for for once
ya the were plants like a filter filtering the system
because you cannot over feed you cannot over feed like hydroponic systems also
plant will die
what about you what do you think you can do to change the world
you know like the greenhouse effect [ah]
ya question [ah]
[oh] my god
bicycle
excursion [ah]
their did mature more environment friendly too
unknown doesn't put like mature discipline implements
[oh] my god ya you know they they estimate the island to be like filled up by like I think twenty forty or something like not even that far away [sia]
ya we'll be fourty then like also like [eh] [oh] my god [eh] #ti# you know what's the best way to make singaporeans like not use plastic bags
where
make them pay for your plastic bags
because singaporeans don't like to pay extra for anything
you just stand [oh] the plastic bags extra twenty cents
you know like nowadays at supermarket right they always do like the
(uh) if you never bring your own bag you pay ten cent for each plastic bag that they use
ya

to be honest <malay>kan</malay> I don't know how they record
like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
like <malay>macam mana macam mana dia orang</malay> record
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
so then <malay>tiba tiba kerja</malay> continue continue continue then (err)
april [kan] lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it
is more of editing
make sense
but what if they start recording okay <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] then that means the movie wouldn't be out [what]
ya cause it's a shit show
ya
okay you think about it
girl wants to be a guy
but she wants to fight
so don't fight if you can't fight
no
it looks stupid
no
I mean <malay>pernah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel [kan]
then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] disney channel then got #mulan# then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] then like [oh] whatever
then there's this one stupid dragon and small dragon with all the
all the ancestors
the father
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad <malay>macam rasa</malay>
disappointed <malay>pasal anak dia perempuan</malay> so <malay>tak ada orang yang boleh</malay> carry on
[oh] so which #mulan# have I been watching
but my story line makes more sense
okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would #mulan# do that
what do you mean by no choice
I think I watched [lah] but I don't remember [lah] [kan]
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about #mulan#
so #mulan# [kan]
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
okay what do you mean by <malay>terpaksa</malay> because if she's <malay>terpaksa</malay> [kan] okay at first she's a guy [eh] she's a woman
woman is not required to go for this [one] [what] this [one]
ya woman cannot go
but then why is she forced to go
[oh] okay okay okay I
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
<malay>tak tak pernah tengok</malay> that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
I watched before
<malay>dia</malay>
no no no I watched already you see
#mulan# go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick
then she go see this ice
place then (err)
she she <malay>sakit</malay> then she <malay>baring</malay> I think sick or whatever I don't know
then the
[ah] sick
so after she got sick
then she lie down then the doctor check check check (err) then the tell the main emperor emperor prince
coy commander (err) leader [ah]
[meh] she's a she's a girl
ya that that's the movie [what] right
she got caught in the
okay but then the most important she got caught at the ice place
by by who
#hans#
so is #mulan# like
based on the real life
<malay>orang tengah berbual pasal</malay> #mulan#
let's finish the #mulan# first [lah]
haven't
okay okay then how about that dragon
with the
#wushu# finger
kung fu panda
okay okay okay okay #wushu#
#wushu#
okay #wushu# then the ancestor how is that
got to do with any cultural
significance
why not
why I just help me understand
no you make me make me understand #mulan# first then I'll make you understand #aladdin#
what do you mean I know that she got caught at the ice place
cause she got shot not got sick
okay why she go to the war
okay so
[oh] so even okay the dad <malay>tak boleh pasal dia sakit</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> in the in that government even though <malay>kau sakit ke apa</malay> [eh] sorry
even though if you <malay>sakit</malay>
okay even if you <malay>sakit</malay> or not <malay>tak kisah</malay> you have to go is that the rule
so the the #mulan# <malay>dia macam kasihan</malay> [kan] that's why she left that note
(oo) makes sense
nineteen sixty five [eh]
!wow! that's about eighteen twenty three man
so what do you want to know about #aladdin#
okay [ah] honestly I think it's stupid [ah] because
okay because
she don't let me drink water [ah]
cause he
cannot [meh]
then you want me talk for one hour no drink [ah]
!huh!
okay
<malay>dia pasal</malay>
this one guy
[eh] wait how's the show [ah]
how how did he find the lamp
[oh] what to <malay>curi</malay>
at the lion place
ya the lion cave
know your facts man
okay whatever okay
so in the
(err) go inside the movie [eh] go inside the cave
then he climb climb climb get the lamp then he rub the lamp [ah]
he met the genie inside he met the genie inside the cave
ya
ya
ya
you know #aladdin# is the monkey [what]
#aladdin# was just like on the cliff
tell me your wish
then they sing a song
but I don't know the song is in the original movie or not is there a song in the original movie
then they sing song
then they rub then he rub rub rub already ask for the first
that was the monkey's first wish
ya that was the genie's first wish
(oo)
okay whatever then after that
the three the three wishes no we have to end this
podcast
no <malay>tak</malay> the first wish <malay>yang dia buat</malay> is <malay>dia nak jadi</malay> prince
know your facts
the first [one] is is he wants to be a prince of

okay okay okay okay let's talk about (um)
so primary school I had no ex
don't have
don't have
there's this okay
there was this one girl <malay>yang</malay>
I was with <malay>macam sama sekolah</malay>
since nursery
so <malay>kita</malay> just grow like from nursery K one [eh]
nursery K one K two whatever whatever whatever [kan] <malay>sampai</malay> P six
we're together so our family very close from
this
then my <malay>adik dengan dia punya adik pun sama kelas</malay>
so then <malay>dia orang macam kacau kacau</malay> my <malay>adik</malay> [kan] <malay>adik dia</malay> [lah]
but then I was just minding my own business
then my mum you know [lah] my mum you know actually any mum
<malay>kalau</malay> they if you find one
guy and one girl in the same class for very long time then they will just start to assume <malay>yang kau orang ada benda</malay>
ya so <malay>begitu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it was just like <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [eh]
a topic in <malay>macam mak bapa berbual</malay>
they both talk talk talk talk talk talk talk then
<malay>bila</malay> primary six
after [eh]
[kan] then I <malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [ah]
then <malay>macam rasa macam suka suka macam nak jumpa</malay>
<malay>ya allah</malay> [eh] wait [eh] <malay>belum habis</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay>
ya so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>suka nak jumpa</malay> that kind of thing
so that time I don't know why I had the balls to do it
so just straight tell her
[ah]
<malay>macam</malay> cute [kan] P six
[eh]
[eh] [eh] [eh] [eh] <malay>dia ni</malay>
!ee! P one

<malay>tak pasal</malay> I <malay>berbual biasa tahu</malay> this is considered normal to me <malay>tahu</malay> but then it's like

(mmhmm)
I can see that
I can see that
I don't see that
no [lah] it's fine [lah]
at secondary school [eh] primary school I was like more of a yes man
yes man is like
you know there's in a group there's that [one] that takes charge <malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak keluar</malay>
there's that one guy okay [lah] <malay>kita gini</malay> [ah] then everyone <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] go [ah] no problem <malay>macam</malay> yes
so there's that one leader in that group
and there's one joker in a group
usually the joker is either small or fat
[kan] it's always like that joker is always small size or fat
yes
<malay>gemuk</malay>
actually when the robot <malay>tu dengar gemuk</malay>
then the robot <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk</malay>
okay
so ya there's leader <malay>ni</malay>
and the rest [kan]
actually just just two people <malay>tahu</malay>
then the rest [kan] is the yes man
so <malay>macam</malay> let's say okay

(hmm)
(hmm)
you know #hanis# never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me [eh]
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want [lah]
too lazy to talk to her
!hais!
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how #rina# always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from #sonya# that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know #hanisah#
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one [lah] down there right and then after that #rina# (uh) (uh) recently only (um) enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then <malay>nak kena</malay> go and study
they have leadership this leadership program [lah] basically but like
(um) #sofia# and #rina# said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked #hanisah# how long are you bonded with the school [lah] and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her [ah] because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her [lah] the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in you know seven years more in and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing [lah] but you think #hanisah# is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not [lah] but it's not worth it I think it's very <malay>bodoh</malay>
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only [ah] ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand [ah] like twenty two thousand I can understand [lah] but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already [lah] anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true [what] like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her [lah] I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with #sufian# and #rina# [what] like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare [lah] she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense [what]
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand [eh]
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know [lah]
I don't know at first she didn't tell me [lah] today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know [lah] is it
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then <malay>tak payh tak payah nak</malay> leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no [what]
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say [ah] who knows #rina# she say this you know who knows #rina# have something planned for me like dude
even if #rina# has something planned for you #rina# is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different [eh] in and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss #saba#
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know <malay>itu pun</malay> so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread <malay>macam roti</malay>
[a'ah] during that time you will see in the you know like during that time he he he he pull the the girl the girl the girl also <malay>nakal</malay> [ah] but the girl quite angel [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> devil [lah] [kan] but she he pull the girl and then he literally did all this then he she it was horrible [lah]

hey #siti#
thanks for joining me for this (err) this opportunity it's really cool
ya
it's really cool because like I feel that I feel so happy to contribute to I think it's really cool have you ever had issues with like SIRI
(uh huh)
ya ya
okay
alright I I find personally in my life if I want to search for something I will go on google I will open my phone type in the pin code go to chrome search okay why for you why is it better to go to like just SIRI
okay
(mm)
ya
[oh] so it's okay [lah] that fun is the factor that you're looking for [lah]
(mmhmm)
[oh] pretty sure [ah]
ya
ya
ya that's true
but I think not yet [lah]
ya not yet cause I heard that apple is moving towards like
you can you can use SIRI to turn off lights from your house you can turn down the aircon I think already have right
there's a apple home but it's ya but the thing is like all the you need you need if you want use apple home all the appliances you use is has to be like apple certified kind of thing
I think so but like not all no but like not all
products is here I think ya maybe they're still trying it out and then they realise that a lot of people are still buying alexa or whatever ya that's cool I guess
you know
ya
I know right
I would you would you think it'd be weird if like our <malay>makcik</malay> and <malay>pakcik</malay> were to start to use SIRI you guys like
okay
okay <malay>raya</malay>
okay
[eh] <malay>selamat hari raya</malay> okay you <malay>makcik</malay>
so
okay [lah] okay [lah] I <malay>pakcik</malay>

(mm) make it warmer ya and then it will
it will turn it you know [lah] you need to unlock your iphone first
exactly exactly
[ah] <malay>pakcik</malay> but then right I think it would help them because maybe they don't know how to do certain things of from just by using their fingers
right so maybe this could help
big time
like
I don't know what is the movie about
ya
okay
okay
[oh] so this people doesn't have a lot of friends or okay
right

ya
right but you feel that

today my treat
yup very convenient and easy
okay come next one I think I asked the second question already right superpower
so yup so that's my question so how about yours what you want to ask
no I I ask what I ask you superpower I ask (err) wish
you ask me what (err) what I do that one and
the I forgot what's the other one
I talk so much until <malay>semua dah lupa</malay>
I also I also short term memory
[ah]
what was I studying [ah] I was studying (err) radiation therapy so (err) radiation therapy <malay>tu kita</malay> treat (err) cancer patients [lah]
so ya my my batch [eh] <malay>kita cuma ada</malay> you guess how many how many people
[oh] very close very close so per year (err) radiation therapy is the smallest community in singapore ever so <malay>kita ambil dalam lima belas orang sahaja</malay>
ya it's the smallest (err) smallest more specialised (err) what you call that
(err) programme in singapore [lah] so <malay>cuma</malay>
I I don't know if I I don't know but it's very specialized all I can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it [lah] it's such a small community
(um) but the best part is ya I'm not I am not practising it [lah]
I don't want to practise it yup
I'm not practising as in you see now I'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so I mean because it's too mechanical like (um) I deal more with (uh) like all the machine machine instead of people
cause my kind of person is <malay>nak</malay> (uh) ya <malay>suka berbual dengan orang</malay> like make that connection feel like (err)
feel like I'm the I'm the cure for them
instead
in in a way <malay>boleh katakan</malay> (err) somewhat <malay>macam</malay> they they they they feel (err)
<malay>macam berharga</malay> [lah] cause (uh) I'm the one which help them instead of like this machine blah blah blah blah because if this radiation therapy just a bit you just shift shift shift the patient here there then after that
(err) <malay>terus</malay> treat <malay>kita cuma berbual sedikit</malay> [jer] <malay>setakat</malay> (uh) ya hi (err) sir ma'am how are you [oh] (err) any side effect you trying to stand are you okay [oh] ya ya how's the pain feeling okay K come sit down sit down
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
I I want ya I I want a heap if can I want to hear people's problem then <malay>macam tolong dia orang</malay> [lah]
in a in a way (err) the field [lah] I want to be is actually like (err) psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but I heard
you will have to go (err) what you call that (err) undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that [lah] and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
(uh huh) so that's what deterred me from what I wanna do [lah] unless I can print money right then I mean like
that's that's wasted on it let's just study
yup exactly money's a big freaking issue
(err) ya talking about it like very depressing already

already in university and
like just before university [lah] then <malay> dorang pun happy happy [kan] !yay! [dah] <malay> boleh semi retire
[kan]
hurrah hurrah [kan] <malay> mane kita nak pergi let's travel around the world
I think it's a long way to go when they are
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but it'll be fifteen years of fun [lah] so what's usually a birthday like
(uh) <malay> macam gitu [lah] <malay> kalau birthday <malay> ni selalu we always tell people that you know [ah] really [ah] even when the adults celebrate the birthday [kan] frankly speaking !alamak! you know is really [ah] for the kids you know
it is really for them <malay> pasal macam they really get into it you know <malay> nanti [kan] (uh) <malay> bila you tell them [eh] no need [lah] anything [lah]
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like [oh] must put this must put that [oh] must sing put the candle [ah] <malay> semua ni [kan] all them [ah]
[oh]
that's why we say [lah] you know like that's what the house [ah] will come falling down I tell you
and you know [lah] usually [eh] some adults [ah] one or two of them will make the fatal mistake you know to give sugar
or sugar reduce drinks you know
[a'ah]
<malay> ini topic [eh] I tell you [eh] I think every young adult [ah] will know this topic very well
[kan] [kan] <malay> kita selalu gaduh [kan]
I think it's more frequent than that [kan] if only it was only every weekend you know <malay> pasal every weekend [kan] is when you actually see [tau]
<malay> kalau you <malay> tak nampak in the week <malay> pun [kan] <malay> nanti dorang stealth tactic you know (uh) <malay> behind your back [ah] [eh] <malay> selit-selit kasi-kasi you know

you know they they will just say no but that's you what you know
this is for my grandchildren !wah!
the double standard [ah] very good [ah]
[ah] so for me
no kids (uh) but I was (uh) raising <malay> itu my nephews my nieces [kan] from the time they were young [lah] (um) partly because for (err) me (err) usually [lah] I'm not around in singapore <malay> pasal
I was studying away [kan] abroad then after that when I was working also (um) I was living abroad most of the time <malay> pasal kena posting
so <malay> selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my <malay> apa abang or adik already <malay> duduk kat rumah [lah] <malay> jaga
my <malay> mak [kan] pasal my <malay> apa parents my late father <malay>dengan</malay> my <malay>mak</malay> my <malay>mak masih ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> my father [dah] <malay> arwah so I moved them into my place [lah] so when I'm home in singapore [ah] I <malay>jaga all my anak sedara</malay> [lah]

(err) <malay> dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa (err) foreign service
[ah] <malay> jadi macam (err)
<malay> lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say [eh] you go [ah] [ah] then you go [lah] so to be honest [lah] I spent most of my (uh) youth away <malay> pasal belajar [kan] you know away in university
then I come back <malay> pun
as a young twenty something I'm usually out
(mm)
out of the country the thing is <malay> ye [lah] [kan] people always say [eh] but you come back what you know what's the big deal but I said ya but people usually travel I don't travel I live away

one and a half weeks right go to two countries seal up your deal

anything to do with travel anything to do with you know (err) in and out of country
gatherings

(mm)
[ah]
<malay> tapi apart from <malay> macam bonus <malay> macam grade [kan] I mean <malay> takde apa-apa macam incentive <malay> ke or
[ah]
ya
ya
ya
(uh) is just to put [ah] <malay> betul [lah]
actually [ah] your
ya actually [ah] your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend [lah] <malay> pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu [kan] one of my friend so he was
(uh) like you accountant also (err) so actually <malay> yang hantar dia so went to <malay> belajar lepas how many years [ah] three years ya three years <malay> lepas tu balik [lah] <malay> balik then of course serve the bond [lah]
serve the bond buat accounting [kan] and like you [lah] also quite good at it <malay> dia punya bond <malay> berapa [eh] <malay> enam tahun masa tu
if I'm not wrong
(uh) (uh) for accounting
not too bad <malay> pasal pun for them <malay> dorang habiskan <malay> dulu baru pergi unlike me [lah] <malay> pasal for me [kan] disrupt (uh)
then [ah] then <malay> pergi luar lepas tu [ah] <malay> balik you see so
(err) <malay> ye [lah] for
for me a bit different so <malay> lepas tu my friend <malay> balik as usual [lah] <malay> kita [kan]
keep in touch
you know especially when <malay> biasa [lah] [kan] <malay> ada baby then baby shower
<malay> lepas tu keep up <malay> lepas tu kaya-kaya then <malay> macam every <malay> dua tiga bulan you know [eh] fed up [lah] let's go have <malay> teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue [kan] suddenly he said
[eh] I'm leaving [ah] my job
his last six years [lah] [ah]
you know I thought very good what no <malay> ye [lah] but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short <malay> apa dia jadi nursing officer

(err) I think that's just tip of the iceberg [lah] <malay> pasal masa period gini [kan] <malay> kena buat banyak [lah] I think the most important yang <malay> dorang kena buat triage <malay> macam
<malay> semua bila datang tu [kan] [ah] <malay> nanti is (uh) people like my friend and his team [lah] then they check and then they ask them [eh] you look familiar [ah] because after a while [ah]
they keep coming back <malay> tahu because now they know what to do like [oh] my back pain (uh) <malay> dapat [oh] I feeling
a bit fever [kan] and a lot of them now get full medical check up
[kan] <malay> pasal when you tell them (ugh) my chest (ugh) cannot breath sir (ugh) (ugh) (ugh) [ah] then you cannot take the risk [kan]

[oh] indonesia (mm)
[ah]

africa was actually my first department
[ah] see I'm older than you [kan] so <malay> tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk [lah] so I covered all fifty-four african countries
so I always joke
and tell people [lah] I literally cover [kan]

<malay> pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know [ah] and then #djibouti# <malay> pasal starts with a D D J
I B O U T I [kan] E ethiopia right all the way to zambia zimbabwe [ah]
so I tell [eh] A to Z know you think what [ah] fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that [one] wasn't posting [lah] that [one] <malay> macam
you know <malay> dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then go to #namibia# then go ghana then go #botswana#
then come back [ah]
then after one month [eh] you go back there again then you go to you know (um) <malay> macam #namibia# then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
[kan] (um) <malay> macam gitu [ah] but back then [ah]
[ah] you cannot stay too long [lah] <malay> pasal
got a lot of things to do [kan]
within say three days you are in one country [ah] !wah! you just pack the program
from breakfast early breakfast or you may even have working breakfast [kan]
so from that time [ah] you know <malay> sampai ke malam [ah] then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work [kan]
so [ah] it's fun [ah] especially when you're twenty something [kan] <malay> penat pun penat [lah] of course but you know it's fun get to see the world [ah] by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone [ah] I'm different era
(uh) no distraction but also [kan]
you must understand [ah] so much harder I mean <malay> dulu
you know then you want to look for somebody you call their hotel number [kan] and then you must remember which room they are in [kan]
then (uh) you cannot find (uh) where you're going <malay> mana ada Google map Google Earth <malay> ni semua right so !wah! everyone <malay> cakap [eh]
now [ah] I cannot imagine [ah]
how you all last time [ah] work without all these [ah]
and I always tell people ya you all [ah] think now life so #mafan# [ah] <malay> susah [lah] <malay> ini [lah] <malay> itu [lah] <malay> leceh [lah] you know but imagine my time I told them started work [ah] no laptop is this thing called [ah] desktop
you know then when the first of the
(uh) when internet came along and then you are supposed to (uh) surf and
do some research [kan] then you must call up
your
(uh) ya what is it service provider [ah] using modem
[eh] but when you first started at Starhub !wah! already [kan]
[ah] [ah] Starhub cuppage [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
Starhub was quite good also [ah] back then
[ah]
I've always been on
in the which department
[oh] when they <malay> itu ambil [lah] [kan]
[nah] I I've been (uh) using until today <malay> cuma sekarang supplement (uh) <malay> gunakan Netflix [kan] <malay> gunakan you know Rakuten View
[ah] <malay>banyak lagi</malay> [lah] sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two [ah] <malay> macam macam [dah] <malay> tak worth it <malay> gitu [lah] [kan] <malay> pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
<malay> budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus [eh]
[eh] good [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
now they are smart they know what to to target
I went through that whole <malay> apa (uh) how shall I put this [ah] I went through that whole cycle [ah] [kan] that whole cycle [ah]
of dora the explorer thomas the train ben ten
power ranger
twinx the magical fairy <malay> ini semua [kan] that that was I went through the whole cycle
[kan] then you have to be always referee [kan] <malay> nanti (uh) <malay> yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband <malay> lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else <malay> abang [ah] then you have to be referee [kan] then when the cousin <malay> semua datang [ha] <malay> lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>kalang kabut
then you know [lah] I'm not a big fan of letting them watch anything
on (uh) handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them <malay>kalau nak tengok semua</malay> share okay
[ah] good for you [ah]
[ah] <malay> macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right <malay> macam mana pun [kan] I mean cannot [lah] you know when ipad first started [kan] I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put [kan] <malay> dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
<malay> macam kenapa [lah] you know maybe [lah] you call me jurassic [eh] <malay> pasal I'm conservative about this thing [kan] <malay> macam !huh! why is your baby looking at Youtube [lah] and this and that [kan] to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry <malay> pasal dia punya lung
get exercise <malay> tahu
<malay> cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor [lah] you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying <malay> pasal babies are
basically crying for attention you know and once they have human touch as you know you [kan]
father of four [kan] you <malay> tahu [lah] [kan] <malay> budak-budak ni semua <malay> bila nangis then you <malay> kasi attention <malay> sikit aja semua okay
but I don't understand [ah] this parents [kan]
[ah] there must be other horror stories you see [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
exactly exactly [ah] <malay> sama [lah]
no <malay> pasal you <malay> pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family <malay> keluar [kan]
it's getting to be quite disturbing to me [lah] [eh] you know is quite disturbing [lah] no you go and see especially pre COVID when families can go out [kan] then you see [eh] father mother two kids maybe [ah] maybe got maid [lah] [eh] doesn't matter
then everyone is looking at their phone
while eating you know so to me is like [eh]
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point [ah] [oh] my friends <malay> semua marah if I
say things like that you know [ah] <malay> kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so <malay> macam no [lah] you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures [what]
right so what
<malay>kenapa</malay> I don't <malay>tak faham apa-apa</malay> you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids [ah]
said [oh] basically you can't be bothered [lah] you know to to to talk to them ask them ask them also no point they don't tell you what happened they just say okay okay okay
said <malay> biasa [lah]
[eh] let's face it [lah] you know even we as teenagers [ah] last time [kan] remember when your mother <malay> tanya score <malay> macam mana [ah] okay [lah]
[kan] despite the fact that you had two fights that day
lost your homework <malay> kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
took it play a joke on you but when you come home just say okay [lah] nothing
where is up to you know as the parent for you too
[ah] tease out [kan] bit by bit and find out <malay> semua [kan] all these kinds of things [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
(mm)
fullstop correct correct
and it's not shift work you know
you you are a parent twenty-four seven
no I think until you basically die I always remind people <malay> pun [kan] you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them [ah] you are still [ah]
a six year old you know ya so that parenting continue and so that's something I always remind
people over and over again [lah] [kan] <malay> pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off <malay> macam even <malay> lepas I <malay> hantar last time [lah] [eh] my <malay> anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
afternoon I check in [what]
although <malay> ada maid ada <malay> dia punya you know grandmother <malay> kat rumah [kan]
but I will just check in okay everything okay you know came back K do homework or not are you know check check check right then when you come home is the same [lah] you know A you know tomorrow got what [ah] got not you know got this now whatever
it's twenty four seven you cannot say like you say [lah] you know you cannot okay for two hours I cannot go up because it's my
duty you know no [lah] nothing to do with that
nothing
but I don't think it's it's just you I think (uh) there are still a small but good number of people <malay>yang macam</malay> you and that's good <malay> tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about <malay> setahun gitu for one
right cause I was an adjunct I was an adjunct lecturer then I saw the kind of (err) students that we have these days
even the good [ones] honestly [ah]
when you
you know take some time talk to them [kan] <malay> tanya-tanya macam mana [kan] then you realize actually they are quite neglected
(err) by parenting
and usually it's parenting by default meaning [ah] is the maid
(mm) <malay> tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know <malay> macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them <malay> macam manja-manja dengan teacher <malay> pasal macam
that is their their parental figure
[dah] [lah] <malay> every day pergi sekolah [kan] and even during COVID and home based learning [kan] they see the teacher still online [kan] <malay> pasal
you are looking at the laptop [kan] and what not ya and although parents now K [lah] belatedly realised !hey! you know actually
quite good to spend time at home spend more time with family and all that
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two [kan] !wah! <malay> budak-budak semua balik sekolah [kan]
no more home based learning for many schools [kan] !wah! most parents hurrah hurrah <malay> pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out !wah!
I saw so many
(mm)
<malay> betul [kan]
(mm) (mm)
bit longer than that [lah]
ya (mm)
[ah]
[ah]
<malay> ni macam shift work [kan] follow the time zone so tell the kids okay [ah] <malay> tidur [eh]
maybe there are other common interests but definitely traveling is one of them [lah] [ah]
[ah] <malay> betul
[ah]
or you can travel a bit [lah] take one day off to maybe <malay> beli-beli barang boleh beli present [kan]
(mm) <malay> beli present [kan] [ah]
especially if nearer to the school holiday <malay> ke [kan]
!wah!
<malay> musim apa musim sejuk

nowadays [lah] rarely snow and it when it snow it's not that kind of mountain type snow it's more what I call slushy
[ah] dirty
you're lucky if is brown [lah] <malay> selalunye [kan] is more like like greyish black <malay> tahu
and then the other thing is I call it slushy <malay> pasal is really that <malay> macam yang that seven eleven <malay> punya slushy you know the Slurpee [ah] [kan] <malay> pasal it's
[ah] the colour of course Slurpee <malay> lebih sedap [lah] you know
it's just that too much sugar no and then
when you walk around <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay> tak biasa pakai waterproof boots and this and that
very quickly your shoes [eh] specially we like to wear sneakers when we on holiday [kan] walking around
very fast very quickly your
shoes [eh] become very wet and then cold

for me last time I would go to manchester <malay> macam a few couple of months I go up <malay> pasal I was studying [kan] that time
(uh) cause I was
(uh) in university [kan] [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] I wasn't in london so you know
for my university (uh) it's already you know out of london so I just go up to manchester [lah] if I go to london I have to go down to london
[oh] <malay> lepas tu nanti one of
not one [ah] couple of my friends <malay> semua gila bola juga
then <malay> dorang ada that time (uh) subscription [ah]
<malay> macam membership you know so but the good thing is being asian <malay> dorang semua mana macam muka kita
to them one of I mean you all look the same you know you know all this (uh) (uh) ya
English people so I'll just borrow someone's (uh) membership
card
and then watch the weekend game or something [lah] you know and my time don't forget because this is (uh) nineteen ninety [eh]
there's no man U wasn't big name
you know
ya it was like you know man city you know (um)
liverpool everton newcastle (um) all sorts of names which today are like a lot of the kids weren't even really remember unless they are really hardcore historian [ah] [kan] you know they track track [kan]
so we go and we go <malay> bukan (uh) division one <malay> aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for <malay> yang macam
secondly thirdly [kan]
and back then also people go up three to two two to one you know and go up and down the league also very fast last time
<malay> pasal takde big name <malay> takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
so that was (uh) always a lot of fun [lah] you know when I was also a student [ah]
then fast forward when you mention paris [kan] I actually (uh) live there two thousand four two thousand eight
(mm) (mm) (mm) I was posted to paris <malay> tapi from paris I also cover (uh) three other countries [lah] I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so <malay> empat
country [lah] <malay> yang kena jaga so for me [ah] when people come usual [lah] you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget [ah] I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
not the duty free but the premium outlet
[ah] <malay> pasal
[ah] because that [one] is one stop
[oh]
euro Disney you see
[ah]
so a lot of people will go there to go premium outlet [lah]
and <malay> kalau pergi london <malay> tu just outside <malay> selalu ni all this (uh)
housewives all these <malay> makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
[ah] dinner set the porcelain and all that you see
[ah] <malay> dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world [lah] so !wah! #shiok# you know so I was in paris (uh) two zero four to eight so <malay> empat tahun [ah] <malay> kat situ
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) I live (err) I lived in (err)
(err) the eight
sorry sixteen in the sixteen
(err)
quarter [lah] they call it [ah] so I'm literally halfway between #champs elysees# the arc of #triomphe# to and eiffel tower
so from my window every night [kan]
<malay> nanti nampak yang that <malay> lampu tu [lah] [kan] <malay> dia macam lighthouse [kan] every night [ah] [ah] so I'll see that light [lah]
circling circling
so I lived in the really the central part [ah]
[oh] so easy for me pasal I just walk to office only about ten minutes
ya so it's quite (uh) good
(mm) [ah] that's the #gare du nord# (mm) (mm) (mm)
the museum [ah] [ah]
[eh] <malay> penat juga budak-budak
[ah]
<malay> naik stroller [lah] two of them
[ah]
actually #gare du nord# when you <malay> keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal <malay> banyak kebab <malay> banyak yang #maghrebian# <malay> nya [kan] <malay> yang daripada morocco <malay> daripada daripada mana [eh] (uh)
ya [lah] (mm) the #maghreb# areas [lah] (mm) morocco algeria you know those kind of places
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
they they call it #bateaux mouches# the flyboat
[ah] <malay> ada dua option satu you just <malay> naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
[ah] [ah]
burn down [ah]
so you saw when it was still
[oh]
no it's actually [eh] really really
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down <malay> pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's <malay> macam symbol [lah] paris [kan] so <malay> bila
[ah]
<malay> bukan sabotage <malay> bukan ada terrorism
[ah] sebab itu [lah]
<malay> sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat <malay> ni semua dorang touring [kan] it's really really
!wow! you know it's really inspiring you see
ya and I do miss (uh) living there <malay> pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world [lah] you know without a doubt [lah] you know
ya
paris [eh] <malay> memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london <malay> macam K [lah] you can walk a bit a bit [lah] <malay> tapi after a while <malay> macam
[ah] boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and <malay> macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery [kan]
(mm)
correct correct
I agree
correct don't look down you know I always tell people when you're in paris [ah] look up you know ya
I mean once in a while
<malay> kena tengok bawah [lah] <malay> pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni [kan]
[ah] then they will just litter the place you know it's like ridiculous you know
but it's a really really a nice place [lah] you know so it's quite good to go
they got [lah] <malay> nanti after COVID
[ah]
after COVID even for me <malay> pun frankly [lah] [eh] <malay> lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore [lah] <malay> pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly <malay> dekat singapore [lah]
<malay> tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice [lah] <malay> pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my <malay> mak [kan] seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend [ah] <malay> masuk #johor# [lah]
(mm)
(mm) and also <malay> pun !aiya! you know <malay> boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids [kan] like I've got even (uh) grand nephews grand nieces [kan] <malay> yang dekat malaysia then its easy to (uh) go to
Legoland [kan] <malay> pergi makan-makan
relax relax you know so quite fun [lah]
you know (uh)
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen [ah] I suspect will probably
only be able to travel [kan] pergi #johor# and whatever <malay> sebelum kita boleh really go out there again [lah]
know <malay> dekat-dekat [lah] you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know (um) <malay> pasal every day before COVID [kan] between two hundred to three hundred thousand [eh] <malay> dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu [kan] <malay> bukannye satu dua ribu [kan]
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so
at the end of the day you know we know [lah]
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right <malay> pasal apa dia punya
<malay> penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
[ah]
paradigm paradigm (mm)
(uh) paradigm about two years about two years [ah]
(mm)
ya ya [ah]
obviously [lah] but also don't forget catered also for the #johorians# who work here <malay> pasal
the ones who are here most of them will open up a account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in you know this [lah] pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks [kan] so
[ah] even for your maid you know today anyway [lah] [eh] these days
as soon as you hire one [kan] then <malay> dorang buka [kan] payroll payroll <malay> nye tu [ah] so <malay> dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
[ah] <malay> dia by two [kan] when you go there <malay> sekarang some shops [lah] they definitely accept Nets which is good [lah] you know
<malay> pasal even for their workers [kan] <malay> lepas tu balik malaysia [lah] <malay> nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up</malay> [kan] <malay>nak tukar duit
[kan] when their salary is already in sing dollars so <malay> dorang !alah! pakai Nets aje [lah] <malay> lebih senang
<malay> tak susah
but you can tell [ah] <malay> macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites [kan] <malay> yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town <malay> betul [lah]
is really bad <malay> macam city square <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
(um) <malay> orang semua tengok !wah! really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully [lah] it'll be a slow and painful process [lah] but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not <malay> macam kita aje [kan] you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so <malay> macam gitu aje [lah]
[ah]
[ah] that's always good question <malay> tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me <malay> macam each one is so different [kan] so
but generally [lah] my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
you know ya <malay> pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know [lah] budget pun <malay> bukannye banyak [kan] even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type <malay> macam
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
you know you just <malay> ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know <malay> macam you <malay> tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you <malay> tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of <malay> teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did [lah] you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd <malay> lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends [kan] [ah] so for me that's where it's quite you know
that that's more it [lah] you know
but I must say (um) not so much now [lah] but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me <malay> pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest <malay> yang dorang <malay> baru [jer] <malay> buka [kan] (err)
(err) not not easy [lah] to go in [kan] that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
<malay> orang asing you know so was a lot of fun [lah] you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
see the developments but the changes [kan] since my time there and it's been what you know (uh) more than twenty years [kan] almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore
[ah] [ah] okay good we are one hour already
[ah] we can stop recording

of (err) leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave [lah] then
(err) I've been trying to clear so
slowly slowly [ah] slowly <malay>gila</malay>
then like (um)
today we had some random meeting
about (err) strength training like (err) for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water (um)
like the whole company [lah] from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to #shanghai# and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams [lah] but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test [lah] before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
(mm) it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths (uh) they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit <malay>macam</malay>
a bit
<malay>apa tu senget</malay>
ya
ya a bit skewed (err) ya a bit skewed [ah] the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
(err)
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the #shanghai# branch and then ya we just shared [lah] then
I went first in that group and when I went first
the <malay>apa tu</malay> the
I took like I think around three minutes [lah] let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy [lah] the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like [oh] (err) there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown [lah] to tell them to tell us that the break room is (err) going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of (um) shut down on the zoom [orh]
[eh] not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay [lah] not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [seh] <malay>kurang ajar gila</malay>
it's not it's <malay>tak</malay> compulsory <malay>tapi macam</malay>
good to know [lah] when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
[oh] that sucks
(mm) do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure #bo#
sure #bo#
[ah]
[eh] <malay>asal</malay> you <malay>tak baca dulu sebelum</malay> you <malay>buat</malay> paper
!huh!
can like that [meh]
okay I think that was me in in <malay>apa tu</malay> in
secondary school also when <malay>kita buat</malay> lit
ya
then why you take
[ah] okay okay understand understand
okay <malay>jap</malay>
speedy <malay>ni</malay>
speedy <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini</malay> [tau] like everytime <malay>dia</malay>
everytime <malay>kita nak</malay> everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
ya [seh]
okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak cukup</malay> attention
<malay>tak cukup apa tak cukup</malay> attention <malay>kesian dia</malay>
but ya (uh)
actually my last week was quite interesting [ah]
not interesting
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
but
(err) because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden (err) he joined the new shift [lah]
ya my three shift correct
so <malay>dia baru</malay> join
so it like his first day was just me and him
because there was this other person but he <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh] no that day he that day
me and jaden
<malay>kena</malay>
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do (err)
what was that (err) had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
ya it was quite <malay>rabak</malay> (uh)
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me [eh] just tomorrow
(err) tomorrow what's that [ah] [oh] tomorrow
I may not be able to [oh] no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was [ah] mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us [eh] on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge [lah] on that day
no it's not a big deal [lah] that job it's just
someone to be (um)
someone to be who's who will answer to the client [lah]
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like [eh] just I think (err)
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay [lah] why then he said [oh] because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
(err) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad [lah]
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
<malay>nak kena siap apa nak kena siap abeh nak kena pakai baju</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>abeh nak mandi semua</malay>
I don't know [lah] I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt [lah]
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
so anyway he told me that [lah] he told me <malay>macam</malay>
(err) okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay [lah] I told him okay [lah] then go ahead [lah] you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day [ah] then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
(um)
!wah! damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not [lah] but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
(um) we are now separated into clients ya
[oh] cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know [lah]
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day [lah] because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like [eh] wait wait wait [ah] !walao! !walao!
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
so <malay>macam</malay> he was damn lost [ah]
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss [lah] I feel bad
(um) hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
(err) I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
[eh] no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day [ah]
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working [lah]
ya [eh] on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
my language classes then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>tak cakap apa-apa</malay> never say anything so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
[oh] you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> give me some heads up (uh)
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve [eh] twelve thirty
then now it's like (err) three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
[eh] for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya [lor] so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
(uh) yes but then
(um) I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes (uh)
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult (uh)
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot <malay>paksa orang</malay> to
<malay>datang</malay> and you know
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
and then <malay>macam</malay> it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I'm
my sleep is deprived
I have to really plan <malay>macam</malay> straight away after finish
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
<malay>pastu keluar lepak</malay> and then go straight to work <malay>atau</malay> sleep a bit more and
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
(mm)
<malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>kerja</malay>
ya and because my shift <malay>pukul berapa pukul tiga</malay>
<malay>tiga pagi sampai dua belas setengah petang</malay>
it's like
if I were to sleep in [kan] that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team [lah] at least they are
they are not big fans of
(um)
this client
this !huh!
no <malay>takde takde takde</malay>
no they <malay>dorang</malay> big fans of <malay>macam</malay> the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill (uh) actually
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>maksud dia</malay>
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything [ah] because it's a totally <malay>lain punya</malay> client ya
yes but
you can always learn (uh) you know what I mean
and it's a job [ah] you are getting paid
<malay>tiga ribu</malay>
plus
ya
you just learn [ah] you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
ya she she took chemistry in the <malay>pastu</malay> (um)
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people (uh) because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good [lah] I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
that I've been very complacent <malay>macam</malay> I've
like this current shift that I'm on [lah] I've been too complacent
not complacent <malay>macam terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>apa tu terlalu banyak</malay>
I don't know I I just I
what's the word [ah] complacent (uh) when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like !whoa! like you know about this like
(err) [oh] <malay>yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok</malay> the the deadline and all that
like [oh] because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
<malay>abeh kita</malay> proofreading we put everything [ah] like whether the date is correct
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers [lah]
the numbering and all that and the [oh] categorisation and all that is <malay>betul</malay>
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it (uh)
like last month or [what] then I realised [oh] shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> whether they
whether they <malay>apa tu</malay>
whether they
can work with you or not [ah] like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
volunteer because <malay>kita punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak ada nak kena</malay> #chope#
reserve
<malay>macam</malay> you must #chope# certain deliverables [lah]
ya
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of <malay>macam mana kita kerja</malay>
okay so <malay>pukul tiga setengah</malay> I <malay>bangun</malay>
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this (um)
this file
then like
(um) from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines [lah] like what are the headlines for today so
let's say <malay>pukul lima</malay> we have to send headlines
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines [lah] ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like [oh] I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
because I'm the kind of person <malay>yang</malay> I cannot <malay>tunggu</malay> for people
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I'm not a <malay>apa tu</malay>
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it (uh) when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
(mm)
often time
but now
that was last time (uh) remember I told you there was like one time in between july <malay>sampai</malay>
september <malay>ke</malay> august
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
<malay>pastu</malay>
jaded ya
just jaded like <malay>macam</malay>
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
so <malay>dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat</malay>
(mm)
!wow!
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
<malay>orang ketiga</malay> [lah]
no
<malay>apa benda</malay> home wrecker
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
no I think <malay>dorang nak</malay> more natural conversation so that
this whatever can pick up
I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
people
(mm)
(mmhmm)
it's too loud
okay
okay
(mm)
ya [lah]
no but I just
I don't know <malay>takut</malay> it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kind of conversation
[oh] so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay [lah] I think it is their job [lah]

just tough stuff [ah] because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> or ask anyone I don't know
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
!wah!
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this (uh) you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by #blah# #blah# #blah#
(mm)
(mm)
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see [ah]
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
[ah] okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
but this kind of thing definitely need <malay>macam</malay> to set up to set aside like at least
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
[ah] but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also [what]
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay [lah] not that bad
#han# [orh]
why
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
(mm) I try play on Borderland [lor]
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
[oh] yes you're right you're right <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> #betuls# okay [lah]
(mm)
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things [eh] like (ugh)
things for speedy for my cat
(um)
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else [ah]
[oh] I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought (um)
to for the #mugen# train I bought the demon slayer masks
cute <malay>gila</malay> [oh] my god it's very cute
ya ya I <malay>dah</malay> wash <malay>lagi</malay> I <malay>dah basuh</malay>
I <malay>dah kering</malay>
I <malay>dah apa lagi</malay> (err) vocabulary <malay>boleh kasi dorang</malay>
I <malay>kering</malay> I <malay>dah</malay> squeeze dry
I <malay>dah</malay> compress <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
ya I <malay>dah</malay> I've done quite a lot of things [lah]
ya so as in it's drying now <malay>tengah nak kering</malay> I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
<malay>bawa balik</malay> [ah] <malay>mana satu yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
I I I I I only want one which is the
#nezuko# [one]
I ordered four
because it all looks so pretty <malay>semua lawa gila</malay>
of course [lah] but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
<malay>dia macam</malay> those who know will know right
and then people think like (err) this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie <malay>dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai</malay> [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
#adli's# watching
ya
ya we've talked about this before <malay>berbual</malay>
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
like you know how when it when it's <malay>macam</malay> when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
I feel like when everybody watches it
dia <malay>macam</malay> it feels a bit cheaper because like
[oh] now they are going more mainstream <malay>lebih</malay> mainstream
the special
ya
ya
(uh huh)
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible (uh) that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also [ah] because like
thankfully
due to the
popularity of <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer for example
or #haikyu# maybe it's gotten quite popular
not as popular of course [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise <malay>nak beli nak beli apa lagi</malay>
<malay>nak beli</malay>
ya <malay>macam</malay> these merchandise <malay>nak beli baju</malay> you know
it's so easy to find
ya [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> if you if it were another show for example <malay>macam</malay> Fruits Basket
<malay>atau</malay> I don't know what's another show I don't hear it (err) hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya so that's what I'm talking about [ah]
hard to be a fan when they're not very
well known so <malay>macam</malay> that's why I say there's pros and cons [ah]
ya
(mm)
so like
okay understand
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh]
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
(um) because I don't know [ah] it's different [ah] it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
you <malay>tahu</malay> [kan] I <malay>ada</malay> classmate <malay>jepun</malay> in my korean class
so <malay>dia</malay>
(err)
she's very she's very quiet [lah] but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
so <malay>macam</malay> most of us <malay>kita ambil sebab kita</malay> either
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
<malay>kita tengok dengar lagu</malay>
<malay>kita tengok cerita</malay> K drama <malay>dengar lagu</malay> K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun (uh)
so I asked her like [oh] how about ya so I asked her <malay>macam</malay>
how about japanese content how are they like then she's [oh] she doesn't actually watch a lot
and she say <malay>macam</malay>
there are not
as many well known
(um)
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
<malay>macam</malay> real people
ya real dramas
(um)
it's not as popular [lah] in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so [oh] I just do writing because she does (err) makeup
like (uh) she studies
(err) what's that called cosmetics I think
(um) I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore [lah] that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
the life in japan <malay>macam</malay> how was her school life or like at least [lah]
then she said [oh] she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it [lah] then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
she's quite nice [lah] then she shared with me like about her school life (uh) how <malay>dia kerja</malay> part time
(um) like during high school and all that
quite interesting [ah] it's it's I love this class because <malay>macam</malay>
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and like the eleven year old <malay>punya</malay> remember I <malay>berbual pasal</malay>
cute <malay>gila</malay>
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian [one] [lah] because
ya because like I like I talk to her about <malay>macam</malay> my trip to #yogyakarta# the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also <malay>macam</malay> in #jakarta# and how <malay>dia rindu</malay> [lah] <malay>rindu gila dengan</malay> #jakarta# <malay>tapi</malay> she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place <malay>paling</malay>
<malay>paling selamat</malay>
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID [ah]
<malay>tak kat</malay> #yishun# not at #yishun#
#jakarta#
ya [lah]
but she used to live in #yoyga# also #yogyakarta#
and then (um) <malay>dia macam</malay> I don't know
very nice [ah] they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different [lah] what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
<malay>boleh boleh</malay>
[ah] I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
(uh huh)
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
<malay>sampai tahap maksima</malay>
kidding
<malay>apa</malay>
(um)
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so (um) I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to (um) calculate [lah] because <malay>dorang punya</malay> numbering is very <malay>susah gila</malay> it's like
<malay>dorang</malay> count [kan] <malay>dorang punya</malay> currency <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan]
in the thousands so like
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia <malay>sama juga</malay>
so <malay>nak kena</malay> you must really calculate [lah]
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like (um)
<malay>banyak fikir</malay> [ah] I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids [what]
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
exactly but <malay>macam</malay>
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to <malay>layan</malay> my korean I feel like I'm such a
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya #koreaboo#
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
<malay>lawa gila</malay> it's very it's super damn it's super nice
!wah! I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online [lah] because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
(um) I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like !wow! and like it's hundred and four [eh]
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it (um)
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech [eh]
say it's for Logitech

hello hi how are you I <malay>nak minta tolong sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh tak</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] my parents <malay>nak makan nasi padang</malay> [ah] but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best <malay>nasi padang</malay> in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like <malay>hajjah maimunah</malay> you know but other than that cause <malay>hajjah maimunah</malay> I went went there just now today they're not open
ya I don't know why I've no idea [lah] so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
(mm) <malay>tak kisah</malay> [lah]
I mean we are going there [lah] but you have a recommendation where
I think I think I know I think I know <malay>yang mana satu</malay> we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried <malay>sana sedap</malay> [eh]
[oh] is that type [lah] I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that <malay>kena</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah</malay> [eh]
[oh] <malay>sebelas</malay> this is for lunch [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>nasi padang</malay> I think the most of the places <malay>jarang</malay> [ah] [eh] I think but there's one place I don't know you <malay>pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nama dia</malay> I think it's called <malay>sari ratu</malay> you <malay>pernah pergi sana buka</malay> I think like <malay>pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka</malay> [tau]
I actually have no idea but I <malay>pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu</malay>
<malay>dia punya lauk masih</malay> still looks fresh [lah] <malay>tak tak rasa macam</malay>
since <malay>pagi ke apa</malay> maybe <malay>dia orang masak petang juga</malay> but okay [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> in case you <malay>keluar dengan</malay> your family or your friends
<malay>tekak</malay> you <malay>nak makan nasi padang</malay> you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road [lah] but it's it's quite near the #kampong glam# area like #baghdad# street or something like that
[oh]
[oh] <malay>apa nama tempat dia</malay> [eh]
[oh]
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall <malay>kalau pergi sana</malay> I think
okay [lah] I think I will try that that what <malay>minang</malay> place there
(mm)
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing (err) my parents <malay>dia orang nak makan sana</malay> cause just nice [lah] think after that I <malay>boleh ke nak jalan</malay> around the area <malay>beli kain-kain ke apa-apa</malay>
that that area got a lot of <malay>kedai-kedai macam gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>jual kain</malay> [lah] <malay>jual buku-buku</malay> [lah] <malay>jual baju</malay> [lah] carpet [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>belum ada</malay> plan but around that area got a few malls [kan]
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
for the house I don't know like <malay>pinggan mangkuk ke apa</malay> think whatever ya [lah]
<malay>dia orang nak beli</malay> I think <malay>nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak</malay> I think can bring to think #bugis# junction quite near
(mm) or any of the malls around there [lah]
ya
ya [lah] I think everywhere [lah] the same but now if possible <malay>duduk rumah</malay> more ya cause if you have to go out also <malay>yang</malay> no choice then <malay>kalau nak keluar</malay> you buy whatever you need to buy you <malay>beli dah beli dah makan ke apa</malay> then <malay>terus balik</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin</malay>
how to say that frustrating like you said [lah] take out handphone take take the
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now <malay>banyak orang buat gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa</malay> you <malay>nak beli kadang-kadang</malay> you <malay>beli</malay> online you <malay>tengok</malay> colour <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>nanti datang</malay> colour <malay>lain</malay>
<malay>kita kita boleh hantar balik</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang boleh</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> refund <malay>ke</malay>
!wah! ya [lah] and <malay>gambar</malay> you <malay>tak boleh</malay> cannot
trust <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
(mm)
then in the end what happened did you <malay>makan</malay> the <malay>nasi</malay> [jer]
[oh]
I think I think got <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] I <malay>dengar</malay> complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
<malay>untuk</malay> self pick up you know you order then you <malay>pergi sana sendiri</malay> you you you
you pick up the food <malay>sendiri</malay> then I order at first they say the food should be ready <malay>dua puluh minit</malay> then I [dah] <malay>sampai sana</malay> I <malay>tunggu</malay> almost one hour <malay>baru</malay> the food <malay>siap</malay>
that time (mm) ya
ya [lah] that one is
that one <malay>lagi</malay> self pick up <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>tunggu dia</malay> delivery I think <malay>mungkin</malay> more than one hour but this was back then [lah] during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think <malay>semua orang</malay> order
<malay>pernah</malay> order grab <malay>takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah</malay> [kan]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup</malay> then <malay>bila</malay> order <malay>tunggu satu jam</malay> ya [lah] that time I I <malay>ada satu</malay> friend <malay>pun dia ceritakan dia</malay> order I think (err) mothers' day I think
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> order <malay>pun dia</malay> order (err)
<malay>dia dah</malay> order <malay>tunggu lama-lama</malay> the <malay>punya</malay> app <malay>cakap</malay> waiting for driver <malay>nak dekat dua puluh</malay> minute in the end <malay>tak ada dia dah</malay> order order order <malay>tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap</malay> cancel <malay>dah tunggu</malay> twenty minutes (uh huh)
[ah] mothers' day [tau] I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
day <malay>ada orang dah</malay> advance order the day before to arrive for example [eh] <malay>dia cakap</malay> you order for today <malay>esok dia suruh</malay> deliver for <malay>makan tengah hari</malay>
<malay>pukul dua belas</malay> [ah] on the next day [lah] they advance order [lah] then when it comes on the day half an hour before <malay>dia orang</malay> cancel <malay>dia punya</malay> order
<malay>orang orang nak buat</malay> celebration <malay>dia orang buat macam gini tu</malay> [lah]
ya [lah] but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault [lah] it's all the the the the restaurants <malay>kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana</malay> then restaurant <malay>yang cakap</malay> cancel but <malay>dia orang tak</malay> fair [lah] then the driver the rider <malay>kena marah</malay>
(mm)
I think maybe for safety <malay>juga</malay> [lah] I think <malay>kalau satu</malay> not not <malay>dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi</malay> check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver <malay>lepas tu orang tu cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>dalam</malay> [eh] inside my my packet got
for example [lah] <malay>dia cakap</malay> I see hair then they complain <malay>kat</malay> restaurant <malay>nanti</malay> restaurant will <malay>cakap</malay> [eh] but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia orang yang</malay> pack <malay>makanan</malay> so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy <malay>kerja dia</malay> is just to send so <malay>kalau</malay>
that one I not too sure [lah] but you know they earn also not much
ya
ya ya [lah] you can see <malay>tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang</malay> still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard (err) I got one friend <malay>kawan</malay> I <malay>satu</malay> (err) whenever <malay>dia</malay> order
(err) I think her mum [lah] her mum surely will will
<malay>kasih dia orang</malay> tip <malay>kasih</malay> cash ya [lah] but sometimes [a'ah] <malay>dia kasih</malay> extra like maybe two dollar <malay>ke lima</malay> dollar
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] I think so but I think maybe
maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya [lah] but good [lah] then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot [what] <malay>kalau dapat</malay> tip and not say
<malay>kerja dia orang senang</malay> ya [lah] <malay>senang</malay> as in <malay>cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang</malay> customer complain [lah] customer <malay>marah</malay> so I think once in a while <malay>ada orang</malay>
<malay>kasih</malay> tip <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>kasih dorang macam</malay> motivate <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah] at least <malay>ada juga orang yang</malay>
<malay>baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah</malay> [jer]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada</malay> deliver [kan] <malay>bagus</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>cari semua tak ada</malay>
<malay>tapi nasi ambeng ada</malay> deliver <malay>tapi nasi padang</malay> I think <malay>tak ada</malay>
(uh) [oh]
<malay>kesian</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak ada</malay> offered to refund <malay>ke apa-apa</malay> that's not good actually
cannot [lah] the customer <malay>dia orang bayar apa</malay>
ya [lah] if you pay then I think cannot [lah] I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
so <malay>nanti esok</malay> you <malay>nak ikut tak</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> cycling (mm)
I think <malay>kita dah</malay> quite long time <malay>kita tak pergi</malay> #changi# beach [lah]
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] we go <malay>kita pergi</malay> early [lah] morning you know I mean by by <malay>tengah hari</malay> we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya [lah] this quite some time I <malay>pun dah lama tak tak</malay> ride my bicycle
you <malay>punya</malay> bicycle <malay>masih ada tak</malay> then okay [lah] is it the same one that you <malay>beli dulu</malay>
cause recently I think that day I I I <malay>ada beli</malay> I went to the bicycle shop [lah] to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet <malay>dah dah koyak dia punya</malay> strap I was talking to the owner of the shop <malay>dia cakap sekarang</malay> like everyday <malay>dia jual</malay> like maybe
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
I think so cause that time <malay>dia orang tak boleh</malay>
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
wherever [lah] <malay>tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang</malay> [lah] <malay>tak boleh pergi</malay> shopping [lah]
I think <malay>dia baru baru buka</malay> [lah] !aiya! maybe I don't know <malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh]
maybe [lah] I think they they the the new movies I think maybe <malay>kalau rasa</malay>
you <malay>rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay> maybe they wait [lah] they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full [lah] I think if they full also it'll be
ya there's no <malay>apa</malay>
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya [lor] but if ya [lah] okay [lah] if you okay
<malay>esok esok kita pergi</malay> to #changi# after that after that <malay>kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak</malay> (mm)
okay <malay>kita pergi</malay> the famous one [lah] <malay>kat sana yang</malay> #changi#
famous
I think the I don't know I think maybe the <malay>sambal</malay> [lah] okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
basic
three dollars [lah] then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that [lah] but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
<malay>esok kita boleh</malay> try [lah] <malay>kalau kalau kalau makcik</malay>
<malay>beli</malay> I <malay>senyum kalau pakcik</malay> then you <malay>senyum</malay> okay think just nice [lah] so we go cycling then go <malay>nasi lemak</malay> ya then after that we head back

if the rain that much then the drain <malay>sumbat mana air nak pergi</malay>
[oh]
ya [lah] <malay>tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang</malay> those landed property
you stay there ya [lah] will damage all the property [lah]
okay [lah] but this kind of weather I think <malay>susah nak</malay> predict <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan</malay> or the other way that day <malay>pagi hujan lebat</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> stop
<malay>terus panas terik</malay>
I think <malay>dia orang</malay> also just <malay>tikam</malay> [jer] [lah]
they just guess maybe
maybe it's the other side maybe you <malay>kat</malay> east side #tampines# maybe <malay>kat</malay> #choa chu kang# <malay>ke</malay> #jurong# <malay>yang hujan</malay> right (mm) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like like that [what] not the whole singapore
(uh) [oh] <malay>kesiannya</malay> then
ya
confirm [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
[orh]
(mm) (mm) that means ya [lah] <malay>lama</malay> [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] but (mm)
I think most of the the what you call it <malay>apa dia panggil</malay> dengue hot spot [eh] <malay>dah banyak dulu</malay> I think <malay>tak banyak tempat</malay> I think near my place also <malay>kat</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>ada</malay> there there there's (err)
one case opposite my block (mm) ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum <malay>dengar</malay> then <malay>terus dia pergi luar dia</malay> check <malay>dia punya pasu-pasu bunga</malay> make sure <malay>tak ada</malay> because <malay>kalau</malay> the officers <malay>datang</malay>
they can summon you [kan] I think ya so <malay>kalau</malay> you have like <malay>tak</malay> [lah]
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I think they come random [lah] it's either that or either that or I don't know [eh] <malay>mungkin kalau ada</malay> neighbour <malay>yang</malay> complain <malay>tak tahu kalau</malay> the neighbours suspect you you <malay>tak</malay>
maybe [lah] maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> take like a a sample
of the water something like <malay>dia orang bawa</malay>
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> lab <malay>agaknya dia orang</malay> check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back [lah] they take some sample of the <malay>air bawa balik</malay> to lab then run <malay>dia orang</malay> test <malay>agaknya</malay> [lah] but ya [lah] sometimes they will check [what] even if they cannot see <malay>kalau dia orang tengok</malay> let's say <malay>rumah</malay> you
<malay>ada ada</malay> plants <malay>ada</malay> potted plants then <malay>dia punya air dia tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tak tukar</malay> they will <malay>tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air</malay> do you change everyday because by right you <malay>kena tukar</malay> so at least if
happen to be the <malay>nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau</malay> you <malay>tukar hari-hari</malay>
then <malay>dapat dapat</malay>
but you you get to <malay>buang dia punya telur apa</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> let's say you
<malay>tak tukar</malay> I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> I <malay>pernah baca</malay> I don't know [lah] maybe takes a few days [lah] maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the <malay>nyamuk</malay>
<malay>telur</malay> to <malay>tukar</malay> [lah] so <malay>kalau</malay> you leave it for that long then maybe you might <malay>kena</malay> summon [lah] <malay>kalau dia</malay> check so that time my my mum <malay>dengar dia terus</malay> check
ya [lah] <malay>kat rumah pun semua tukar</malay> at least everyday [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah] the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that [lah]
ya [lah] so <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> ya [lah] because the the like what's the
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito <malay>dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kena gigit pun</malay> (mm)
so I think if you if you <malay>rasa macam</malay> you <malay>kena gigit dengan</malay> mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor [lor] <malay>dia punya</malay> mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then <malay>dua tiga hari lepas tu</malay> you <malay>demam</malay> I think better go doctor you check
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>tak ada dia</malay>
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
(mm) then that one can can can lead to complications [lah] <malay>kalau tak kalau biasa punya</malay> after some time it will it will get better ya [lah] but <malay>leceh</malay> [lah] you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you <malay>kena</malay> dengue
ya so how to prevent
then you cannot see [what] <malay>kalau dia nak gigit</malay> you <malay>dia pun tak tak</malay> warning
ya
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day <malay>dia punya</malay> the number of cases for COVID [lah] was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya [lah] but
these countries I guess because <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
ya then some of them might not be even <malay>kat</malay> hospital you know
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high [lah] okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya ya [lah] because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers <malay>tak boleh kerja</malay> [kan]
ya I know ya
(uh) (uh) maybe ya
ya I think so
ya [lah] but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
<malay>semua orang</malay> first time <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> ya but
not only the construction [lah] I think when the
foreign workers was was told to quarantine [eh] quarantine themselves <malay>duduk kat dalam</malay> dormitory <malay>tu kalau</malay> I <malay>tak tahu rumah</malay> you you <malay>tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat</malay> my office <malay>pun sama dia punya</malay>
<malay>pokok-pokok dia punya daun semua dah</malay>
<malay>dah tak terjaga</malay> ya [lah] that shows
so ya [lah] you can see that actually
the foreign workers are important only time time <malay>macam gini</malay> then people realise [oh] ya ya [lah] this during this difficult
period you <malay>boleh tengok macam orang yang</malay> what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like <malay>macam</malay> those <malay>tadi kita</malay> complain <malay>pasal</malay> grab food driver and all that ya <malay>kalau</malay> you imagine <malay>kalau dia orang tak ada</malay> that time circuit breaker you <malay>nak makan macam mana</malay>
ya [lah] some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya [lah] if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch <malay>baru dapat</malay>
[kan] nowadays (mm)
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody <malay>bersihkan</malay> know your around your area under your block all that
(mm)
true ya (mm)
ya once in awhile [jer] [lah]
ya [lah] but <malay>tempat</malay> your workplace how you still going to work or
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
when that day I think I was at the area [lah] raffles down there [lah] you can see I was there lunch time <malay>macam tak ada orang</malay> (mm) can see that there is definitely different [lah] you see the lunch time crowd <malay>macam</malay> more like a ghost town I would say
ya [lor] but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay [lah] ya [lah] okay [lah] if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
including my my <malay>tempat kerja pun</malay> I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen [lah] sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause <malay>sekarang dah berapa tiga</malay> [eh] <malay>dah tiga</malay> since march <malay>dah lima bulan dah</malay>
most of the most of the business
working from home still <malay>masih</malay> survive <malay>apa</malay> so why do they need to like rent office <malay>mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap</malay> business <malay>jalan</malay>
true
ya
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kat rumah pun</malay> at least you save transport right if ya [lah] our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
two to three hundred on transport food
(mmhmm)
maybe the only thing <malay>yang</malay> you spend more I <malay>rasa mungkin</malay> is just your utilities [lor]
[kan] <malay>bila</malay> at home
whenever you on the fan [lah] you on your laptop cause usually
ya
if not usually you are at home <malay>malam-malam</malay> and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven <malay>hari-hari</malay>
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya [lah] but funny
because <malay>bila dulu</malay> time <malay>sebelum</malay> all these <malay>terjadi orang semua nak keluar</malay> so <malay>sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah</malay>
[a'ah]
ya <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>mana dia orang nak pergi</malay>
airline <malay>pun</malay> even the airline <malay>nak pergi pun</malay> the the the I think the government doesn't allow
ya I mean like once in a while
<malay>kat</malay> singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though <malay>kecil</malay> still got a lot of places if you want to explore
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe (err) get people to stay home more
give them more things to do if all the businesses <malay>tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat</malay>
<malay>takkan nak tengok</malay> [jer] [eh] but everything
ya I think like <malay>hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa</malay>
ya <malay>kalau tak</malay> it's not like <malay>kita</malay>
we said what the <malay>wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun</malay> the cinemas <malay>belum buka</malay> so
ya but not
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new <malay>macam wayang</malay> I mean <malay>filem-filem yang baru mungkin</malay> more people will will go <malay>kalau tak ada orang</malay> not interested ya [lah] at least they have entertainment at home or more
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya [lah] like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
your ya but I think no choice [lah] <malay>sekarang semua kena gitu</malay>
ya like <malay>dulu pun macam apa tu</malay> during <malay>bulan puasa orang nak bayar</malay> what you call that the <malay>zakat fitrah</malay> ya but now also everything online [what] <malay>dulu</malay> people would queue at the
<malay>masjid</malay> you know (mm) even
the <malay>yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban</malay> also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya
ya
okay
ya [lah]
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the [kan] they do everything at around your what you call that
(mmhmm)
ya I think all the woodlands #jurong# I think they were I forgot I think <malay>tak salah</malay> I <malay>ada sepuluh</malay> ya ten different places where they have the celebration [lah] ya
ya
ya <malay>kalau dia orang buat dekat</malay> the same place then more people will go there [what] so I think they have to [lah] to to <malay>elakkan orang</malay> go to like the #padang# or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people <malay>tak akan</malay> you know <malay>berkumpul</malay> at the <malay>tempat</malay> which is better [lah] everything [lah] like (err) I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
postpone postpone next year
ya [lah] cannot [lah] some more <malay>lagi</malay> that kind of event I think you're talking about
ya millions of people [lah]
okay [lah] but better [lah] like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
(err) can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
saw got people post <malay>gambar-gambar yang</malay> the river singapore river [lah] the some of the beaches the sea looks
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing [lah] it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they (err) those india and china those populated countries who have like (err) haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so <malay>tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi</malay> and then <malay>kita kat sini</malay> I mean we don't experience that that [lah] but for me personally I <malay>tengok bila</malay> during circuit breaker <malay>tak banyak kereta</malay> you can see like you said <malay>bila kita pergi</malay> jogging <malay>kat luar ke apa macam</malay>
<malay>lagi</malay> fresh <malay>dia punya</malay> air <malay>tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta</malay> right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also [lah] that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
(mm) you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
<malay>apa yang yang</malay> I <malay>nak cakap</malay> you <malay>tak payah</malay> spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive [what] you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this (err) COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake [lah] ya suddenly ya cause I got
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business [lah] like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves [lah] but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you <malay>ada</malay> whatever [lah]
hobby <malay>baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh]
<malay>main gitar bernyanyi</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>kalau</malay> if this thing didn't happen you you'd <malay>takkan tahu yang</malay> all this thing you <malay>boleh buat</malay> so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side [lah] or what
has
ya [lah]
(mm) ya right
<malay>kita</malay> complain complain <malay>hari-hari pagi petang malam pun</malay> you complain also the thing will still remain then <malay>takkan</malay> today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
right
true ya but I guess people are just people <malay>dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap</malay> right
<malay>macam ni</malay> [lah] government government <malay>kasih duit orang</malay> complain government <malay>tak kasih duit pun orang</malay> complain
so I think ya
<malay>betul kita cakap orang pun</malay> I think <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>pun</malay> complain <malay>juga</malay>
true ya true
ya [lah] once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you <malay>nak kena tengok</malay> you <malay>tak boleh degil</malay> you know <malay>nak dengar cakap</malay> you [jer]
ya
ya (mm) (mm)
ya that's what I mean [lah] ya
complain but at the end of the day I think especially <malay>kita kat sini kat</malay> singapore I think <malay>kita</malay> still not as bad as you compare to other countries
other countries other countries they locked down like
you can't even I mean you can maybe you <malay>boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin</malay> you <malay>boleh beli</malay>
<malay>beras</malay> all those <malay>barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin</malay>
<malay>satu minggu sekali</malay> but still singapore I think
not bad [what] like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
(mm)
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
<malay>itu pun ada orang</malay> [kan] that time <malay>berapa</malay> a lot of people <malay>masuk</malay> facebook <malay>masuk</malay> stomp <malay>tak nak pakai</malay> then <malay>kena kena</malay> all the officers <malay>suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal</malay>
(mm)
ya by right <malay>bukan susah benda tu nak</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
I see them <malay>tu</malay> [lah] that time
government <malay>kasih</malay> free [leh] <malay>nak minta dia orang pakai</malay>

you cannot monitor what they do or what you have to trust them you know their whatever they submit as work

twenty four seven like around the clock because you have deadlines to meet and then there's no
break it's more worse [lah] if you have to work at home [kan]

most of my job
either work from home or face to face [ah] I preferred <malay>tapi</malay>
also depending [lah] like cause I'm doing project right like I said then <malay>macam</malay>
prefer face to face [lah] so that we
can do things chop chop fast fast just
you know
<malay>habiskan</malay>
projects so basically (uh) <malay>kalau ada apa apa</malay>
clients like we have clients
that come to us and then they say that [oh] I want you to make this app for shopee
so we will take in that project and then we will work on it [lah]
(mm)
you can say that (uh) I do
I do mostly the front end
it's called and design [lah]
so ya not not if you see
[oh]
ya they don't give the option in the skillsfuture [kan]
ya
the comfort of the home
ya
but my project requires me to work with
a few other people [lah] so
ya ya you know the <malay>kalau</malay>
one part of the the programme is not working
then you have to like
do a video call [eh] hi how (um)
how the project going you know
how how to solve this issue and then takes like few hours to solve it
<malay>macam</malay> (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> [ah] it's better to do face to face [ah] you know like <malay>lincah</malay> can just
look at the computer and then there's
do (uh) [oh] ya
whatever [lah] right now <malay>pun</malay>
we cannot complain much [ah] because
COVID [mah]

[ah] I just want to
don't you feel like
it's a bit suffocating <malay>kalau</malay> you stay at home work from home
you lacking the human interaction

[oh] she's not
she's a
[oh] so right now she's also finding for job [lah]
<malay>kirakan</malay>
[oh] okay [lah] there's some source of income [lah]
but I think <malay>kalau nak kalau nak kahwin sekarang pun macam</malay>
ya considered a luxury [ah] because you have to have a stable job what you don't know what's gonna happen next right
ya
I get what you mean
ya
ya basically
I mean technically we are muslims [what] so we do have to you know
go the proper way <malay>kena ada majlis perkahwinan</malay>
you have to like
we have to have right I mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then (uh)
the wedding services
that one I that one I thought is just a
really [ah] that one I don't know [sia]
that one that one I don't know [sia] I don't know I don't actually know how it works <malay>kalau</malay> your partner is a non-muslim
[oh] really [ah]
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] <malay>ada benda macam gini</malay>

(uh) I don't think so
no I don't <malay>tak tak ingat pun</malay> you <malay>ada cakap</malay>
almost three years
(mm)
cause you are thirties right do you feel the pressure from your parents <malay>kalau</malay> your parents <malay>ada</malay> pressure you
your parents <malay>ada</malay> pressure you
it's really you man
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much colourful I don't have a baby you know you know I think it'd be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
[oh] my god I'm the
polar opposite of you
because (err) my parents think that I'm a workaholic
and (err) ya cause I
[kan] <malay>kalau</malay> you are studying normally you just focused on studying right
ya but I prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there [ah] I I don't I don't really get much sleep I don't really do much but I I
I like being busy in that sense
so I I tend to neglect <malay>kalau ada</malay>
(um) like I neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so I'm a I'm
quite a workaholic
ya I'm still twenty five also I don't feel the rush you know to
really get married I feel like even if I get married now it's because that
I don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd I don't like crowd I don't
(uh huh)
(mm)
ya [lah] I feel like
no I feel like I want to get
H we want to we should get first then
(um) you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get first then
get the wedding cause some people they get married first <malay>kahwin dulu</malay> [ah] then
<malay>tak ada rumah nak tinggal</malay>
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like I feel like it's quite crowded [lah]
ya I just <malay>nak keluar rumah</malay> you know have your own
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl [ah] then they expect a lot of you
female
get out [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
are you will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you (uh) get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married

there's a lot of (uh) there's not much of commercialised building it's more of (uh)
industrial building
so a lot of (um)
foreigners there [lah]
a lot of foreigners there that do not follow the law
some more there's not much (um) my area there is just <malay>macam</malay> industrial there's not much activity going around
in terms of police or anything
no no
I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know or vehicles
but
it's quite scary [lah] <malay>kalau balik malam-malam</malay> then
you will be scared [lah] because
(uh) all around us there are people
especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation (um)
those (um) touch and run away kind
ya then <malay>ada juga</malay> (uh) <malay>pencuri</malay> which is
thief you
when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house [kan]
I take I walk from pioneer
then I <malay>jalan balik</malay>
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home
like I feel that (uh) people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know (uh)
they even take he even took the same lift as me
(uh)
I told my parents [ah] then my parents <malay>macam</malay> cause my parents are in the
you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
ya my parents on <malay>gila</malay> [lah] you know they are all in all these
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know [lah]
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the
the members and then the members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough

I
I would confront them but
I'm a very small person

I cannot [ah] I just for me I feel I get
anxious over crowds
so I'm not a crowd person
I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so #jurong# staying at #jurong# west is quite fitting for me [lah] you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in #jurong# west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
fact that you feel like <malay>seram</malay> [ah] especially if you go home late at night
okay [lah] I mean it depends [lah]
you you can you can stay at #jurong# east if I'm not wrong #jurong# east <malay>ada</malay>
#jurong# east also considered area but then

(err) I ya [lah] but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me (uh) <malay>pasal</malay> my wish is my need [ah] right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish [ah] to something else I <malay>tak tahu apa</malay> [ah]
you
<malay>dia orang cakap</malay> by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb (err)
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know [oh] my god I don't know how we gonna do it [lah] but [ah] I <malay>rasa dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> the struggle is gonna be real [lah] like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless <malay>kita</malay> hop on trends or unless
we have quality content [lah] but I think we have quality content [eh] I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that (err) getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I <malay>rasa itu paling susah</malay> [lah] [sia]
I think you are confusing streaming <malay>dengan</malay> video <malay>kita memang buat</malay> video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the (err) console to record the whole the whole the whole session
and then after the record like the two hours long session it will be uploaded on youtube then I download the video and then I will cut the parts where I want to use for my highlights video [lah]
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing [ah] so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play [lah] because I don't think people wanna do that yet <malay>kita kita</malay> not at that level [lah] nor we want to venture there <malay>pasal kita</malay> I think
streamers <malay>orang</malay> they are like deejays they are like radio deejays <malay>dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak</malay> inside jokes [ah] where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff [lah] but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality [ah] ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
in in the videos in the edited videos ya I think I think our creativity will come out more than we are when we are streaming [lor]
something like that ya ya
so besides the highlights so each video will have a particular game that we are focusing on and then we have to create content around that particular game
so people will be interested [lah] I I I <malay>baca dekat dalam dekat</malay> youtube <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> if you want to start something like this [ah] you have to be you have to know what you are
(uh) like you are trying to focus on [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macm kita kita nak kena main</malay> this specific game [jer] [tau] because what people want is people want
this content from you [jer] so you <malay>macam</malay> the speciality [ah] so ya <malay>macam</malay> they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a <malay>macam</malay> a doctor advising sickness [what] that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy <malay>kita nak kena</malay> like specialise in this one game [jer] and then like a random <malay>kadang-kadang kita</malay> we see if we can <malay>selit</malay> one or two games inside
you need to give like variety like that [lah] ya so we are supposed to be the subject experts on that
ya but picking that game and being good at it (err)
<malay>apa</malay> like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game [lah] ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I <malay>rasa</malay> challenging [sia]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] of course not man
<malay>kita punya tak begitu</malay> [sia] I I make sure the content that we <malay>kita</malay> push out <malay>semua</malay> quality [sia] I mean it it should provoke a feeling [lah] and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness (err) like you <malay>kalau ketawa</malay> I think that's that's quite good already [ah] where we <malay>ini kerja keras</malay> like a no brainer you just <malay>tengok habis</malay> doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad [lah] <malay>pasal kita</malay> edit <malay>susah payah kerja keras</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[oh] the live stream [one] <malay>memang tak ada apa-apa</malay> like only live stream [one] is really moments [lor] the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
I didn't say any
ya hand me down
unless
ya wear for swimming
ya man I think
settle [sia] I <malay>dah belikan</malay> #safwan# <malay>dah</malay>
which one
(err) I <malay>rasa</malay> like fifty (err) so ya I think fifty to hundred and fifty ya it was quite cheap
because <malay>kalau pergi yang kedai betul punya</malay>
can reach like
it can range from two hundred plus to like five hundred dollars [sia]
but this [one] I got it for cheap [lah] like <malay>dekat</malay> Ali Express so that was good
I think three weeks cause it was custom made
so I think they have to like get the measurements right actually I also don't know whether they got the measurements right cause (err) I mean it fits [ah] I have no complains [ah] so I assume they the custom made it [ah] cause they they asked to put the measurement and I did measure myself <malay>ukur ukur ukur</malay> ya
got your help with that [ah] you <malay>ukur kepala ukur</malay> shoulder <malay>ukur</malay> my forearms

take [lah] half day <malay>bila lagi nak ambil</malay>
next two weeks <malay>baru</malay> christmas
next week <malay>ada apa</malay>
ya is it <malay>bila</malay> you on leave right I thought you have long leave like
!wah! shiok [sia] !alamak! I want to do that
I accumulate <malay>dua puluh hari</malay> [sia] you
I <malay>selalu</malay> I <malay>selalu</malay> (err) <malay>selalu</malay> like <malay>fikir macam</malay> like last year <malay>punya tu</malay> I <malay>selalu tak nak habiskan</malay> I <malay>selalu simpan</malay> for the day that I want to leave the company
ya that's the plan
my plan is always to keep leave so I can <malay>macam ni</malay> I have to serve notice two months [sia] you now at least I clear leave I serve like
one month [jer] [sia]
no [lah] from <malay>dulu</malay> [sia] I <malay>macam itu</malay>
I <malay>selalu tak nak habiskan</malay> if I can bring forward I will bring forward
there is no point in I don't know [lah] to me <malay>macam kalau kita tak kalau kita ambil</malay> leave to not go on holiday why would you want to take that leave
some more <malay>kita tengah</malay> work from home [kan]
ya
<malay>bila dia</malay> hospitalised [eh]

ya we change the sink we change a sink that has a cabinet
it has to include installation
and we have to do for both
because <malay>kalau buat satu</malay> then the other one <malay>tak buat</malay> then the next time <malay>kena buat</malay> then is like (err) what <malay>buang masa</malay> but I think it's fast [kan] <malay>yang</malay> that time your father <malay>tukar jamban</malay> knock knock knock <malay>letak jamban baru macam cepat</malay> [sia] like in less less than a day <malay>dah habis</malay> [sia] ya that time remember ya [lah] he call somebody [ah] your (err) <malay>abang punya</malay> father

Netflix
<malay>dah ada dekat</malay> (uh) mobile
(uh) <malay>habis senang untuk kita</malay> just you know
you pay one-time fee <malay>habis senang untuk</malay>
watch any movie anytime anywhere
(uh) and you also
can watch your favourite anime <malay>tapi</malay> depends [ah]
sometimes not all the show that you want <malay>ada dekat dalam</malay>
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite (uh) show or anime
so now
<malay>apa cerita</malay> you <malay>tengok dekat</malay>
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
<malay>tidur</malay>
<malay>bangun makan</malay>
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
yes so <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> my class start at eight
(um)
the latest that I arrive <malay>paling lambat</malay> I think <malay>pukul lapan</malay>
[eh] (um)
sorry
<malay>sepuluh</malay>
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
<malay>tapi</malay> I will try my best to come school early next time
then (uh) maybe
<malay>cuba juga</malay> improve my
grades
and (um)
now I have a lot of projects so <malay>tengah nak habiskan semua</malay>
(uh)
so when do you graduate
two years
<malay>lama</malay> [seh]
(um)
I only left with
four months
(um) then after four months
I think <malay>nak</malay> apply <malay>kerja</malay>
then
(um) just
work
then (uh) if there's
(uh) school school (uh) if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cari duit</malay>
so it's best for me to work
(err) <malay>bulan depan</malay>
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about (uh)
(uh) money anymore
I
okay with
<malay>apa-apa</malay> you <malay>cakap tadi</malay> [ah]
because (uh)
<malay>dalam masa depan pun</malay> I think will continue my studies
but ya
good that (uh) I have a friend like you
(err) that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
<malay>apa</malay> you join
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
<malay>tak tak tahu kenapa</malay> also I join then when I was sec three
my <malay>kawan</malay> (uh) all <malay>ajak</malay> me go
join rugby
and that's where I grew my interest <malay>dengan</malay> rugby
so I've
played rugby
<malay>dah masuk sepuluh tahun</malay>
ya so
rugby (err)
is with me since (uh) secondary school
and now I'm in a (uh) club
(uh) #tamoko# lions
I <malay>anggap</malay> rugby as a
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
whenever <malay>nak pergi</malay> training
I can see on my (uh)
meets
ya
(uh) I recently got injured because of my bad leg
so <malay>bila kaki tu</malay> injured
(uh) <malay>kena pergi</malay> doctor
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that (uh) nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
[orh]
(um) when I was young I like extreme sport
(um)
so <malay>bila</malay>
time <malay>kecil tu</malay> my bicycle
<malay>tapi</malay> is not your normal bicycle is like
(err) then (uh)
secondary school I go to
(err)
skatepark and I like skateboarding
so <malay>daripada situ</malay> I pick up (uh) skateboarding also
so I play <malay>dengan</malay> skateboard together
(uh) hopefully that
<malay>tak ada</malay> break any bones because I want to continue playing
<malay>dengan</malay> skateboard and also maybe hopefully
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> [lah] (um) play rugby in another ten years
(um)
speaking of commitments (uh) I think
(err)
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
we live our life together <malay>sama-sama</malay> in <malay>dalam satu rumah</malay> happily
(um) I think
they are having confusion about phase three
<malay>tapi</malay> I hope that phase three is coming soon because <malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay> malaysia
<malay>tak mahu cakap pasal</malay> mask
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
<malay>dalam bas</malay>
then when you breathe and there's fog <malay>dekat cermin mata</malay>
you know how terrible that is
I can't wear contact lens <malay>takut</malay>
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
<malay>bila</malay>
my <malay>kawan</malay> like
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
I <malay>pun tak sabar nak</malay> (uh) <malay>habiskan ini</malay> COVID
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably (err) go out in an adventure
ya <malay>sedih bila dengar</malay> Teo Heng is closing down
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news [ah] fake news
so (uh) I really want to go karaoke with my friends [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (um) if it's not karaoke
I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nak pergi main bola dengan</malay> my <malay>kawan</malay>
[oh] of course I want to <malay>keluar dengan</malay> my family
(uh) <malay>ajak dia orang pergi</malay> dinner (um)
and for my girlfriend (uh) probably go out on a date
you know (uh) <malay>pergi</malay>
somewhere (uh) and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
[oh]
<malay>tak pernah dengar pasal</malay> hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher <malay>tu boleh buat untuk</malay> staycation
(uh) anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
[oh] ya (um) actually
<malay>dah lama</malay> plan
(err) go staycation at least
ease off my mind off (uh) <malay>jauh dari rumah</malay> at least you know
meet somewhere that <malay>macam</malay>
I have never been before so at least
(uh) <malay>boleh</malay> relax my mind
[oh] (uh)
<malay>bila</malay> I go wild wild wet
(um)
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
<malay>kita pergi</malay> wild wild wet but actually it's different because
<malay>kena</malay> lineup time (uh) the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people <malay>dekat dalam</malay> you only can go one round
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
<malay>boleh</malay> enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go #sentosa#
(uh) go beach with my family and
<malay>agaknya</malay>
cannot <malay>agaknya</malay> bring my girlfriend along
and (uh) you know swim
<malay>dekat sana</malay>
(um) actually <malay>tak pernah pergi sana</malay> but I hope to try
(um) I'm not afraid of heights
are you
(um)
like just now <malay>bila</malay>
I <malay>cakap</malay> I don't like (uh) I mean I like heights right
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
I <malay>takut</malay>
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
<malay>bila dia tengah naik</malay> suddenly <malay>dia turun</malay>
(um) I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
<malay>tapi</malay> no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] similar
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube (err) like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
<malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> [lah] because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and <malay>nak cuba</malay>
drifting
and
<malay>agaknya kalau boleh</malay>
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
(uh) I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
<malay>macam</malay>
(err) when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
(um) my favourite car is
(uh)
(uh)
there's <malay>satu</malay> specific
that I <malay>suka</malay>
it's a M three (uh) I <malay>tahu</malay> you don't like cars but
(uh) is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
ya actually <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
my favourite car is mostly (uh) japanese
for example (uh) Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
(um)
<malay>tak tipu</malay> actually is one of my favourite
#tokyo# drift <malay>punya cerita</malay> (uh) in all the movies
#tokyo# drift is one of them
[ah] actually
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>percaya</malay> there's nine fast and furious movie
but I only watch till
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so <malay>macam dah malas nak tengok</malay>
and I watch (uh)
way before [ah]
(uh) nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because (uh) he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
ya <malay>macam</malay> for me
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>boleh suka bola</malay> like
<malay>semenjak kecil</malay> (uh)
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
(err) like twenty years
in fact that
<malay>semua</malay> of my family
support the same club
(uh) yes <malay>ada</malay> baby pictures of me wearing a
man united shirt
(um)
actually I <malay>suka</malay> club too because of the history
and (uh) the manager himself that (uh) brought man untied to win (uh)
twenty titles
man U
<malay>dah tak macam dulu</malay>
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
(uh) they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win (uh) all the (uh) season
and (err) what I heard recently
(uh) but it's <malay>datang</malay> from a rival club [ah]
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
<malay>bagus juga untuk dia orang</malay>
after like how many years <malay>dia orang menang</malay> club (uh) cup
(um) I'm not being a hater <malay>tapi macam</malay> I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
while man U have already won twenty times
if
<malay>kalau tak nak pergi kerja</malay> you can always take <malay>tapi kalau dah ambil</malay>
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [lah] rest <malay>dekat rumah</malay>
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
(uh) probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya (uh) (um)
hards hard time has to come first <malay>baru</malay>
easy life <malay>baru datang</malay> so don't expect everything to be easy
(mm)
ya I get what you mean <malay>tapi</malay>
ya I also
<malay>harap</malay> that everything will
(err)
go back into the normal state [lah]
and <malay>boleh dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>boleh dapat kerja senang</malay>
and everybody starts to work normally and (uh) (uh)
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> everybody at (uh) live their normal life after that
ya
I hope that good news <malay>akan datang</malay>
<malay>kalau tak</malay> we will if <malay>orang tak</malay> (uh)
stick to the (uh) rules
we will not go to phase three
yes I agree with you so
<malay>akan datang</malay> [ah]
we just need to
move on
and pray for the best

okay dear (um)
just a question
we planned about going to korea south korea
<malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>nak pergi sana</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay> you think that it's a <malay>macam</malay>
we should go there [lah] you know
aside from that
you sure you like korean food [ah]
I thought you don't
you don't like
(um)
<malay>macam</malay> fishy fishy stuff you know
but the problem is weather what if
it's cold
it's cold and you (uh) <malay>tak tahan sejuk</malay> you know <malay>tak tahan sejuk</malay>
so you are you are telling me that <malay>kita kena</malay> shop before <malay>kita pergi</malay> korea
no
that's not what you're supposed to do
but the question is when no [lah] kidding
let let let's leave that to later [lah] but
(um)
I the the thing is that I want to go there <malay>sebab</malay> I've been there
so
it's a place whereby I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tempat ini bagus untuk bawa</malay> partner [ah] you know
to have
a good time with my partner
so
ya that's why I wanna go there
I don't know <malay>kalau</malay> if there
they have #mukshidonna# there <malay>tapi</malay>
better than nothing right
but in korea
there will be a lots of walking
I'm not sure if you can <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tahan</malay>
there's not much escalator there's a lot of stairs
excuse me all the more we shouldn't bring a lot of stuff
<malay>sebab kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> shopping <malay>dekat sana</malay>
<malay>bawa benda</malay> bring light pack light [lah] you know
confirm <malay>berat</malay>
that's why you should pack light
so that you can shop more
that question
we shall leave it to our budget
no [lah]
since it's far right there's no point going for like like you know like a short trip
might as well like take a one week
trip you know since we are already there
or maybe more than one week
seven
I don't know what is that
but then again right
I wanna go there when it's winter <malay>tapi</malay>
I'm just afraid that <malay>kalau</malay>
you know [lah] <malay>kita tak tahan sejuk</malay>
I <malay>tak tahan</malay> but you know
I <malay>tak</malay> I I <malay>tak pernah</malay> experience snow you know so
what more if it's the first time with you
I get to experience snow
my first snowfall for my honeymoon

it's making sounds so you know
I don't even know
honestly I don't even know what is singer oil and <malay>apa benda itu</malay> and what is the usage and function of it
ya because my childhood is spent like playing around on land and on sea not doing anything
[oh]
ya
[oh] I know why I <malay>tak tahu ini benda</malay> cause I don't sew and I <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak jahit</malay>
is that that could be the reason [oh] okay
!hais! <malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>tahu cakap pasal</malay> childhood did you
grow up most of the time in the west you did right why am I asking again ya it's always been in the west
actually me too
(um) (mmhmm)
serious [ah]
ya
never ever your family or parents wanted to or any
[oh] !wow! !wow! I <malay>tak cakap</malay> #yishun# [seh] I wanted to say to the east or the south
you know what I mean
well now that you what
(uh huh)
when was this
right so <malay>maknanya</malay> you were about primary school
[oh] okay that you were young wait <malay>tapi</malay> please explain to me how you know about this information you were so young

that building that land is is been there for a while [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you know
since you say you were still young
so
does it look old
ish from the outside
!huh!
<malay>dia dah</malay> (um) refurbish and upgrade is it
interesting okay
live
[oh] okay
is it due to cost and expenses
do you want to talk about it is it even sensitive okay
I mean but [oh]
principles so I guess we can break it down to priorities also [lah] like
they are raising you also and they're still
early in their marriage days
(hmm)
you raise me up okay sorry suddenly reminded of that song
I understand
you were saying ya okay priorities [lah] in that sense
like getting a house
(mm)

okay that's very nice of
(um) when I was in school <malay>macam</malay> doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening <malay>macam</malay> at that point of time we don't feel it [lah] obviously cause we too young
to experience it <malay>tapi</malay>
ya it's so interesting
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so <malay>macam</malay> more comfortable
I mean everyone has hardships [lah] but
it's like this is a life that's comfortable for you and me and ya
for you sorry not me why why am I in your picture anyway for you
okay
[oh]
it's always been in the west nice

ya do they still find it <malay>macam</malay> alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore <malay>macam</malay> cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself <malay>pula</malay> on my own
with my parents et cetera <malay>macam</malay> it feels very alien
I <malay>pergi tempat lain gitu</malay> it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless <malay>macam</malay>
I have people who go with easties that go with me to that area
what do you think
just #sembawang# [lah] in the north

actually what what I had planned for this year was
<malay>macam mana nak</malay> okay okay [lah] (err) maybe before that also [lah]
before that <malay>aku kerja dekat</malay> public utilities board [lah] (uh) it was ya you you know [ah]
[ah] bill <malay>air</malay> [lah] bill <malay>air</malay>
okay
so ya so that was my first job [lah] ever since <malay>aku</malay> I I've I've been working there (err) <malay>untuk enam tahun</malay> [ah] so (err) so (err)
I was in the I was doing (err) project management in their construction line [lah]
[ah]
yes
ya I I applied for (err) I I was quite lucky <malay>sebab</malay>
(uh) <malay>aku</malay> apply <malay>kerja tu</malay> and (uh)
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response [lah]
and the
[ah] ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times [lah] so
[ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kerja sana</malay> for <malay>enam tahun</malay>
then (err)
at at that time <malay>pun</malay>
(err) when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job
then (err) I also I also same like like like you [lah] also thinking what should I do what's my career path because honestly speaking <malay>pun</malay> at that time <malay>bila aku</malay> apply <malay>itu kerja pun</malay>
<malay>aku aku
it was just a job for me
<malay>dia bukan</malay> [ah]
(uh) it's just a job for me to pay the bills [lah]
and [ah] just to
to to to earn to earn money [lah]
I rather than <malay>kau dah</malay> <malay>abeh duduk rumah tak buat apa-apa</malay> [kan] so (err) so might as well
I just took took up the job [lah] so (err) when I took up the job I <malay>aku</malay> got a lot of free time and <malay>aku pun</malay> look around <malay>aku tengok kawan-kawan aku aku punya</malay> friends
most of them they further their studies
so <malay>aku pun fikir</malay> I think I should also do that <malay>tapi</malay> I also I also made a mistake
like <malay>aku</malay> like follow the <malay>aku</malay> follow the
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
like in a way follow the trend <malay>bukan ikut hati bukan ikut hati sendiri</malay> [ah]
[ah]
so or everyone's anytime at <malay>aku</malay> was like saying to myself [oh] everyone's furthering their studies so I should also take up a further my studies [ah] I didn't I I didn't really (err)
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay [ah] just go go go ahead with it
a degree then I I asked myself like okay what degree should I take at that time <malay>aku aku pun tak</malay> sure [lah] <malay>nak nak</malay>
<malay>nak ambil</malay> degree <malay>apa</malay> then <malay>aku cakap dengan diri aku</malay> okay since <malay>aku</malay> working in this line
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree (uh) which
is related to my work [lah] so (err) maybe (err) (err) few years down the road (err)
I <malay>apa</malay> my boss
I have good relation with my boss then they they they see an opportunity in me then is (err) <malay>kirakan</malay> (err) is one way for me to progress [lah]
down my career path [lah] in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
[oh] okay (err) I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up (uh) civil engineering ya [ah]
(err)
it it it
(err)
it's related [lah] but
(uh) not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the (err) engineering aspect [ah] it's more to the project management side
[ah] so as to be honest <malay>pun apa</malay> my diploma <malay>pun</malay> anytime time <malay>masuk</malay> poly <malay>pun</malay>
it was just like [ah]
I just take up this course [ah] it wasn't (err) (err) it wasn't it wasn't like [oh] <malay>aku</malay> passionate about this course (err) <malay>aku nak nak jadi</malay> engineer no [ah] in it was nothing like that [lah]
ya
so (err) at at that time [ah] after <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>pun</malay> ya you you should you feel lost [lah] <malay>macam apa kau nak buat dengan hidup aku</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> [ah]
so [ah]
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now [lah]
so <malay>apa ni</malay> at that time <malay>pun macam lepas</malay> <malay>pun abeh macam</malay>
even before during my poly I went for my (err) internship
so it was during my internship that that made me (err) think twice to to join the construction industry
<malay>pasal</malay>
(err) it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
(err) for my internship [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
internship <malay>aku yang</malay> really opened up my eyes <malay>yang</malay> [eh] !siala! <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] industry
[ah]
the working hours the nature of the work (uh) the work environment
(err) (err) ya
(err) <malay>pasal</malay> okay
(err)
<malay>aku</malay> don't mind [lah] telling <malay>apa</malay> telling you the story <malay>tapi</malay> if if you don't mind listening if you if you are a person who is not bored to listening to stories <malay>aku</malay> don't mind just
just sharing my my my experiences [lah]
okay okay (mm)
so (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> for my internship
ya they attach me to a local construction company
(err) so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries [lah] or you can see a big difference between a local company and (err) (err) foreign or multinational company [lah]
I (err) in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that [lah] so I was attached to a local construction company [lah]
so the first day I reported to work (err) like <malay>aku masuk dia punya</malay> office the office is a
(uh) its a container office [lah] because it's a construction site <malay>apa</malay> but this [ah] this construction site okay [lah] [ah] wasn't like those like <malay>ulu ulu punya tempat</malay> [ah]
[ah] the the project I was attached to they were doing a

back then <malay>pun aku</malay> wasn't really a
a a <malay>apa ni</malay> I'm
I am a very quiet guy [lah] <malay>aku</malay> not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
but
[ah] when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it [lah]
[ah]
so so ya you <malay>aku aku</malay>
improve on my soft skills and then <malay>dekat</malay> (err) during my course of work <malay>pun</malay> there like what I told you [ah] who decided to further my studies take up
a a
a degree [lah] then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
(err) previously was unisim now they call it [ah]

ya
<malay>apa</malay> (err)
since you say it like that <malay>pada aku</malay> in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in [ah] so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay (um) which I agree [lah] which a degree is not really [ah] <malay>apa</malay> a need [ah]
in the industry because your industry (uh)
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
<malay>tapi untuk aku</malay>
when <malay>aku</malay> did my degree (uh)

I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them <malay>nak kereta</malay> I mean like ya [oh] sorry I don't know [what] I mean I don't understand like
(mm) like your brother (mm) wait are you an only child !wow!
wait wait he do army malay army quite shocking [ah] cause you know they always #jio# us at
they throw malays everywhere but the army
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry [ah] I quite shocked [ah] but #alhamdulillah# at least he got there I mean <malay>macam</malay> token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
of course [lah] but
the thing is I also scared cause did you hear the cases like female in the army like the chances of them getting like harassed sexually harassed like a lot of things [lah] you know last time malaysia had like female army also then they abolish it because event the sergeant all that rape the girls
I mean like that's like the ones that speak out some of them get silent like don't tell but if you go then I wish you all the best hopefully
ya those are like misogynistic people I hate that but like I don't know cause I always thought like I can juggle myself but I hear my friends all that the thing is like when you are at the stage K maybe cause you are strong but
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just <malay>risau</malay> then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior <malay>macam tukar macam</malay> sergeant <malay>kau</malay> then <malay>kalau nak buat benda</malay> like he can <malay>macam</malay> threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can <malay>macam</malay> move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you <malay>nampak</malay> the news <malay>baru keluar</malay> like [ah] this chinese man
<malay>dia</malay> freaking like molest <malay>budak kecil perempuan</malay> and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is <malay>macam kalau nak cakap pasal</malay> sexual cases like harassment <malay>kat</malay> singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
no I don't think we is worth comparing like that itself is itself a whole different issue ya like but then and racism is completely different but the situation is like of course [ah] but like black women have it worst
you mean over why you refer like that
but he his child is what he believes what you can handle yeah cute [ah] you you thought like your friend like that
that's
too formal ya I think he also understands the way we (err) the way we speak
how are you gonna disrespect [orh]
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of <malay>para</malay> muslim say that like !alah! but then like <malay>maki</malay> !alah! also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism <malay>macam dia tak nak apa-apa</malay> religion at all <malay>kat dalam dia orang</malay> country or <malay>tak nak</malay> individualism <malay>kat dalam</malay> country <malay>dia orang</malay> also <malay>dia orang tak nak</malay> [ah] <malay>tudung semua tak nak</malay> which I don't understand because other people from other religion <malay>macam</malay> nuns <malay>tu semua</malay>
because they <malay>tutup</malay> also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards <malay>macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh</malay> and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya <malay>dia kata dia tak suka hijab</malay> cause we look scary
ya like I don't understand (err)
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot [lah] <malay>macam aku boleh</malay> (err) <malay>macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun</malay> the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant <malay>dia orang tak kesah</malay> but the thing is even if you <malay>tak kesah</malay> or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need [oh] really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
then like just leave us alone if you don't understand us you know you don't respect us also there's no need to like bash us just leave us alone
ya I think cause of our <malay>agama</malay> also cause you know #nabi muhammad# he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot <malay>agama</malay> and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world <malay>kita dalam</malay> bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so <malay>selesa</malay> and comfortable <malay>dalam</malay> singapore then when you like <malay>tak kesah</malay>
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and <malay>apa lagi</malay> like just <malay>perangai dia orang</malay> [ah] I'm wanna believe is adolescence but <malay>macam bodoh apa</malay> like <malay>kalau kau tengok balik</malay> they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of <malay>mak minah</malay> scares me ya scare me like <malay>dulu dulu</malay> is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion [ah] <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> I see them like throwing <malay>maki</malay> [ah] <malay>mak kau</malay>
<malay>mak kau</malay> ya is just uncomfortable [lah] to <malay>tengok</malay> like the younger generation
is very <malay>sedih</malay> ya <malay>macam kalau</malay> cause the thing is (um) like the older generation <malay>tak nak pergi</malay> I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> the younger generation <malay>aku macam</malay> (err) like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
<malay>apa dia buat ni</malay> [ah]
honestly I don't even think you are a <malay>minah</malay> you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they <malay>fikir</malay> just because then they feel <malay>macam</malay>
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something [ah] is not even <malay>tegur</malay> is like <malay>sindir</malay> like <malay>asal kau</malay> I'm like (um) sorry sally like like you know like <malay>asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau</malay> I'm like (um) I'm trying my best you know like the way they <malay>tegur</malay> is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
sometimes is the way they say is very hurtful ya (mm)
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to <malay>jaga hati</malay> or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you <malay>ungkitkan balik</malay> I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context <malay>macam apa ni bodoh</malay> like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit [ah] a bit sometimes they a bit too proud [ah] of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up <malay>macam dulu aku kecil-kecil</malay> how [ah] I don't know [lah]
how they say like last time they small young they pray so many times do this do that I'm like why
!wow! congratulations !wow! <malay>masuk jannah esok</malay> but I've met some people that <malay>dia orang</malay> (err) like <malay>hafal al quran</malay> all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I <malay>tersinggung sikit sebab</malay> I <malay>tak boleh hafal</malay> but like you know there's no need to
say it out loud if you want to say you know there's a way to say it across without I mean you get it there's a vibe ya then sometimes if if like more than one person say is wrong and this is what we get from you then you still reject it it's obviously not us it's you ya
I come after you [eh] <malay>aku baru habis khatam</malay> [tau] <malay>kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam</malay> like !wow! and usually is like not saying what [ah] but is the <malay>madrasah</malay> kids <malay>pun macam gitu</malay> ya and then they
[eh] I don't know <malay>cakap bahasa arab aku macam</malay> okay thanks [oh] my god ya [oh] my god ya is it like sometimes <malay>aku</malay> like just <malay>fikir</malay> and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by <malay>cemburu</malay> or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like <malay>macam</malay> it just like <malay>sakit hati</malay> the way they talk to us is like that
I think is is how you act on your jealousy
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you <malay>khatam</malay> like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to <malay>macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang</malay> not even about <malay>quran</malay> or what like just in life general <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia lari empat</malay> round you you <malay>baru lari dua</malay> round then you just say [oh] I finished eight rounds <malay>macam gitu</malay> you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also <malay>apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang</malay> vlogging vlogging <malay>tu</malay> [kan] okay
I don't know how it digress but if you get like license motor you want to get like what type of motor !wow!
I only have one girl friend that <malay>ada lesen motor</malay> and she <malay>bawa</malay> scooter ya <malay>comel bodoh</malay> and is very is the [lah] like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that [ah]
okay sorry I didn't know it's <malay>comel</malay> at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like <malay>hujan</malay> a bit difficult though ya (mm) ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the <malay>besar</malay> one just like five K starting price
that's first hand right I think my friend bought second hand [one]
!wow! like that's a lot of money [sia]

same like like #rilek-rilek# ya ya <malay>macam sendu</malay> ours <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>minah-minah ni</malay>
I'm not sure yet like ya I mean I just want to drive my parents around [lah]
yeah I think yeah that's the priority actually I plan to take it this year like my birthday passed but like #chun# #chun# right like the month I want to take it then circuit breaker happened
then like they refunded to me <malay>aku malas nak</malay> register <malay>balik</malay> and then now online registration got registration fee like online fee I think it's like three dollars or four dollars <malay>aku macam</malay> I don't want [lah] I <malay>gemar cara</malay>
walk in and like ya a bit the timing ya cause like if I start in april this year what if I finish it next year june july cause like the estimates my friend got like one year mine is the shorter [one] ya that [one] like she go everyday or what [lah] clear
but private <malay>mahal</malay> ya motorbike but actually I learn how to I don't think is illegal cause my family has like houses like in indonesia then we also have family there then sometimes we just ride the motor there like they teach us [lah] so technically
I can <malay>bawa</malay> already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who <malay>takde lesen</malay> then they just <malay>bawa</malay> motor they just <malay>bawa</malay> as long as you <malay>tak kena tangkap</malay>
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends [lah] like you know they just <malay>bawa takde lesen</malay> as long as you <malay>tak tangkap</malay> is okay <malay>takut</malay> risky
no but you can <malay>beli</malay> motor <malay>tak lesen</malay>
can like my friend no (err) family member that can pay you see my friend (um) <malay>jual</malay> his motor to this kid he haven't even get his license
then he <malay>dah dah letak nama dia bayar dah dah ambil dah budak tu</malay> I don't know if he has his license already [lah] but at first when he <malay>beli takde</malay> I don't know how he gonna learn also cause of like circuit breaker last time but at least he is learning now
but ya but don't [lah] don't it's illegal illegal don't do illegal things you smoke like cold or hot ya I can smell it why honestly <malay>bila</malay> my friends <malay>cakap pasal ni aku tak</malay> but they said got the feeling the feeling
they said hot <malay>sakit berat berat</malay> is it what you say heavier [ah]
I have no idea but [oh]
but you know one brand like <malay>gudang garam</malay> that [one] like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like <malay>bawa ke sekolah</malay> and then they spread [ah] ya like I don't know how they supply <malay>dapat</malay> like that day <malay>budak ni bawa tu macam</malay>
you know when they <malay>jual</malay> it then that thing you know then <malay>dia kasi kasi orang</malay> I don't know if they <malay>beli</malay> or what [ah] but I'm just like very curious <malay>macam mana korang dapat ni semua</malay> especially when they are underage and then <malay>beli</malay>
wait you have an island there !wow! that's so cool
which part is that which
which part is that [oh] like you are in the islands [oh] so my family is like my mother side from #jakarta# so ya is the capital (um) ya it's alright yeah it's alright
(mm) I've never been there also
I mean [eh] that's a huge flex [eh] you want to like <malay>minum bandung</malay> I want to drink <malay>bandung</malay> in #bandung# like !wow! I mean if
you had the money like <malay>takde</malay> feeling there [ah] <malay>makan</malay> french fries <malay>kat</malay> singapore
[ah] don't attack me like that ya K but not saying our humour I think we've been bred like that do you see now like the media singapore media so lame
!wow! [oh] ya
but interesting [what] they get to think what we are thinking also I bet they are like listening or just like what the heck is going on wait do we have to transcribe this [oh] do we I don't want [sia]
you want like just keep quiet right and then <malay>tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang</malay> why is it quiet [ah]
<malay>kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba</malay> like [ah] <malay>budak ni tak nak kasi duit</malay> (mm) (mm) #inshallah#
<malay>kasi</malay> surprised <malay>kasi</malay> us another surprise
I think so ya
<malay>tapi</malay> feel like <malay>banyak</malay> though on the other side <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>budak-budak ni</malay>
I mean who doesn't <malay>duit tu siapa tak nak</malay> though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche <malay>semua nak buat</malay> like <malay>orang cina-cina</malay> you know like the youtubers <malay>siapa ni</malay> I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel [lah] in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast <malay>melayu</malay> like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start [ah] then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know (err) malay podcast usually talk about <malay>agama</malay> like a lot of it
no
sometimes malaysian humour confuses me (mm) (mm) on spotify have [ah]
cool (uh) I mean that's good also they are trying to
I <malay>pusing</malay> so no [lah] [eh] I only ever seen like those ya but that [one] is like <malay>tiga puluh sen</malay> like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that [one] you pass around your friends
lighter <malay>kau ada</malay> lighter <malay>tak</malay> lighter <malay>aku dah habis</malay> ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
or you can start like refillable refillable lighter start a business !wow! look at us planning business ya I mean go for it
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just <malay>tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi</malay> I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but <malay>aku tak dengar banyak macam</malay> success story for <malay>melayu</malay> that's like !wow! you know
(mm) I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya <malay>untuk anjing</malay> [ah] I mean that's for them [ah] that's a niche for them but like <malay>aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya</malay> community <malay>diam</malay> [jer]
[kan] [kan] <malay>aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan</malay> though
no I think like when we send it to them then <malay>dia orang akan dengar</malay> and I think cause cause the video they show <malay>dalam</malay> form like changing changing the code switching that [one] I think they <malay>akan belajar</malay> to like analyse the way we <malay>cakap</malay>
interesting [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit [lah] how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like <malay>campur</malay> is usually one one like ya around me [lah] is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the <malay>bahasa ibunda</malay> I'm like bro
I think as long as you can hold a conversation is okay
ya <malay>betul betul</malay>
how how no like cause like I've been to K everybody been to stations but like like most of them they are like chinese
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that <malay>aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa</malay> I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore <malay>hijab</malay>
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered #bak kwa# before I'm like <malay>我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren</malay> no #bak kwa# for me no oink oink for me sweetie
like then they get so aggressive I'm not I'm not hating or anything but they are so ya and like ya and like you know on also during sitting down they will like stare you down I've never seen a malay aunty stare you down for a seat
but like the (err) chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if <malay>kalau tu bukan apa ni</malay> reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course
(um) I won't go as far as full responsibility maybe just a bit ya

okay hi #azli# yes and we both of us are (um) married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
(uh) twenty nine but I <malay>tak terjun botol punya orang</malay> <malay>sebab</malay> I I don't know because that time I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>terjun botol</malay> when you actually (uh) proposed to me right I <malay>rasa macam</malay> like the happiest girl on earth [lor] then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam semak</malay> because the thing is that (um) it's not very often for me to get (um)
I don't have boyfriends before I have like boyfriends like <malay>macam</malay> those people who idiots people [lah] but then (uh)
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say [oh] automatically I said yes [one] so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like [ah] because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
(uh) condo credit card car and whatever the C [lah] but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like (um) like what you want to do when we get married
will be like [oh] no this one [lah]
he cannot I already [mah] so you say that you end up
so when that time when (um) it was my turn right (um) I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like (um) does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually (um) proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up [ah] that time we were already like twenty seven I think
ya so our age was catching up so we feel like we old !wah! <malay>sudah tua mahu kahwin lagi</malay> [ha] ya so
I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I think this the right time for us to get married
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like (uh) knows (um) a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
[ha] decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married [ah]
because of the and the right that one all (um) we we prepare ourselves yes (uh) I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
(uh) we all all our by ourself [lah]
but remember that time we <malay>kena kena tipu</malay>
the for our <malay>kad jemputan</malay>
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like (um) they say it in (um)
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them [ah] then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think (uh) we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars [eh] I was about to fork out everything [eh] to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't [eh] I was actually thanks to
to your mother also [lah] from actually stopped me also <malay>mak mak</malay> stopped me
ya because I trust them so much
but then (uh) at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because (uh) it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give [lah] but that time
[ah] ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways (uh) it actually works I print exactly [lah] that's why [ah] you got extra correct so that time
so (uh) eventually after that we that's not the only problem [ah] during our wedding [ah] actually my greatest fear for (uh)
I actually [oh] the next one the problem was (uh) the <malay>kalau</malay> the <malay>tak nak nyanyi</malay> [eh] <malay>tak nak</malay> show up we got the best [tau] he's the funniest guy the funniest guy ya quite popular he's she's actually
quite popular in #suria# also and (uh) he's one of the funniest guy [ah] I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out !alah!
ya wasted [sia] it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like !walao! not on my wedding [lah] [sia]
!huh! ya he want to back out because he said something like he not agree with the with the caterer [lah] then that caterer also say (um) I don't know [lah] he's like that [lah] the <malay>perangai macam apa</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I was like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>merepek</malay> [seh] <malay>perangai</malay>
ya attitude then ya I was like you're funny but then still attitude <malay>macam</malay> #siak# so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) eventually I
call I I try to find <malay>kat</malay> facebook <malay>tengok ada tak siapa-siapa</malay> so I found
but before our wedding there was this (uh) issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free [lah] contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the eventually become better [eh] best [eh] until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also (uh) still wish us and he is like one of the best I feel [lah] so shout out to #azuri# and then (um)
ya our our wedding take place #azuri# #azur# but (uh) the his name is #azuri#
okay
so ya okay so
then that [kan] so all the <malay>lagu semua</malay> [lah] <malay>ada lagu melayu semua</malay> all <malay>mesti ada dah ada pun dah bagus</malay> (uh) <malay>baju semua</malay> awesome but the only thing that I scared for all the weddings right
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the doesn't show up the
the whatever [kan] <malay>semua tak</malay> show up <malay>tak apa tapi</malay> caterer <malay>kalau tak</malay> show up !wah!
my mum will go crazy because the thing is that <malay>makanan apa</malay> [kan] [ha] <malay>orang datang tak ada makanan nak kasih apa</malay> maggi <malay>mee</malay>
ya
is very much (um)
ya <malay>macam</malay> [lah]
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy (err) better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya I mean (um) he he <malay>dia</malay> very professional [lah] professional <malay>dia tahu macam mana nak berbual dia tahu</malay> and <malay>dia tak ada macam menyakiti siapa-siapa di hati pun</malay> for [ah] because the reason is that my mum is under religious <malay>punya</malay> school studies so <malay>kalau</malay>
so <malay>kalau cikgu macam ada cikgu-cikgu ke ustazah-ustazah datang nanti</malay> my mum was like [eh] don't open like all these kind of song [ah]
[ha] so <malay>macam</malay> he understand like throughout truly [lah] everything <malay>semua dia faham semua</malay> so the was good
(uh) eventually the wedding turn out good and also caterer <malay>datang</malay> we got our photoshoot photographs <malay>semua</malay>
but eventually the only thing that we don't get back is yes <malay>kita punya</malay> video <malay>tak dapat balik</malay> so orang lain (um) <malay>tunjukkan</malay> video <malay>kat</malay> facebook after like what
two weeks <malay>kita sampai sekarang belum lagi tunjukkan</malay> video because we do not have the video ya we want to do again
ya
yes correct then the things that <malay>bila</malay> I that's when I found out that <malay>macam</malay>
(um) actually I don't really care [lah] that's it's correct [lah] <malay>macam sedih kita tak dapat</malay> video <malay>tapi</malay> at that same time I say
video could be just a story then <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>nak cerita</malay> I <malay>dengan</malay> you like forever <malay>punya cerita</malay> video so I say okay
I want to get my own video <malay>tapi sampai sekarang masih belum buat</malay> because my computer very slow
ya I know <malay>banyak tapi</malay> video (um) computer slow the things that all <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> the computer <malay>baru datang baru boleh buat</malay>
okay so ya make it a drive all right so (um) is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage [ah] the wedding [ah]
[oh] ya the weather it was nice [ah]
(mm)
<malay>cuaca</malay>
ya the <malay>cuaca</malay> was nice because <malay>dia tak hujan tapi dia tak panas pun</malay> so it was just that perfect moment
ya
but for me I have regret I have like a lot of regrets actually for the wedding (um) because that wedding [kan] (um) I like my wedding <malay>betul</malay> but
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
back then I would actually definitely go to orange ballroom orange ballroom <malay>punya</malay> wedding right is like <malay>terbaik</malay> [ah] <malay>pada</malay> I (um) shout to #shah ibrahim# he make it like <malay>macam</malay> it's like a hotel
<malay>tapi</malay> still <malay>macam tak</malay> hotel <malay>juga</malay> parking is the perfect place to park the car because <malay>apa ni kat mana</malay> [eh]
[kan] #tanjong katong# complex yes so that place was <malay>macam</malay> #tanjong katong# complex where <malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) what is called ya (mm) ya <malay>dia punya</malay> parking is open space it's there's lot of parking <malay>kalau tak ada</malay> parking <malay>pun</malay> you can still park at #wisma# you can still park at
#hooga# [eh] <malay>salah</malay> group <malay>punya</malay> side <malay>banyak tempat untuk</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> park secondly aircon
ya that time was like the aircon was best and then <malay>dia punya makanan</malay> and then when I ask my friend because (um) I think a lot of people already three of my friends already get married there <malay>semua cakap makan</malay> and everything is just cost like less [eh]
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
ya about thousand a thousand people also so it's like <malay>macam</malay> that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding I mean it was like <malay>macam</malay> if I was married on that time right then it'll be nice [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> one thing about bad about that place it's not bad [lah] I say <malay>macam</malay>
not that fantastic about that place is just that <malay>dia punya tempat nak tukar baju</malay> and everything (mm)
[ah] yes because the things that <malay>macam</malay> okay for
all malay wedding as what we know as <malay>apa kita tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti nak kena berapa banyak kali</malay>
[eh]
ya around two to three right (uh) some ours was three ya ours was three [eh] no the <malay>sanding</malay> was two and then the <malay>nikah</malay> was one but <malay>nikah</malay> was a day before
so <malay>macam kita kita macam</malay> !wah! get married and then [ah] one thing about ya that one is just that [ah]
and then <malay>dapat</malay> hotel <malay>semua</malay> my friend actually (uh) because of that it actually slow down the the wedding process [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> because wedding malay weddings like <malay>kelam-kabut nak mampus</malay> [leh] <malay>bukan bukan</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> you [dah] you <malay>nak tukar baju</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>nak kena pergi patah balik kat tempat sanding</malay>
<malay>sekali macam</malay> you <malay>nak kena naik kereta</malay> go to the hotel just to <malay>tukar baju</malay> and then go back there so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] traffic and then <malay>campur</malay> you <malay>nak kena</malay> make up <malay>semua</malay> and then <malay>nak kena pakai baju semua</malay> so eventually that one [ah] take process up to two to three hours [eh]
the hours [eh] maybe along the way do you figure at know criteria was amended to !alah! <malay>dah cukup datang</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak juga pasal kalau nak buat</malay> photoshoot <malay>tak ada</malay> time <malay>mesti orang nak ambil gambar lagi</malay> [kan] [ha] <malay>semua orang nak ambil gambar</malay> that time semua [ha] <malay>selit sikit</malay>
<malay>sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> that's the only <malay>macam</malay> if for orange ballroom [ah] but then if I would go I will still do at orange ballroom then who knows maybe our ten year anniversary <malay>kita buat</malay> wedding <malay>lagi</malay>
and another thing is inviting people that I don't like this is my mum <malay>punya dia akan suka</malay> okay about malay wedding [eh]
you will always invite those people who either you like or you don't like or <malay>terpaksa</malay> like
because these people are like somehow somewhat related to you I remember there's this one <malay>makcik</malay> when my mum actually invited her to our wedding she was like [eh] you got child <malay>ni</malay> you got child some more [ah]
!walao! I was like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>nak</malay> [eh] <malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] <malay>makcik ni</malay>
a lot of the the cousin after that right like after my first cousin usually <malay>dia orang cuma ingat yang</malay> my mum <malay>cuma ada</malay> my brother and sister my <malay>kakak</malay> [lah]
cause my brother my <malay>kakak</malay> is the only people who are like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>terserlah</malay> I me and my <malay>adik kita orang macam</malay> relax [ah] <malay>kita orang</malay> relax chill <malay>lepak</malay> bro <malay>tak buat apa-apa semua kita</malay> relax <malay>tak macam</malay>

because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
I feel like <malay>macam</malay> that is the most the best thing [ah] of my wedding the food was nice also sadly ya
it's not about <malay>tak boleh makan</malay> or can <malay>makan</malay> also it's all about like
picture perfect I don't know [ah] maybe maybe it's not something to regret now actually [ah] <malay>menyesal sekarang pun tak guna tapi</malay>
(mm) <malay>tak</malay> [ha] <malay>dah kahwin pun</malay> [ha] <malay>tapi</malay> (um)
talking about rewind also ya if can rewind this is all the things I want to do [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau tak</malay> then I I I I still okay so <malay>takpe</malay> okay so nevermind let's move to marriage life okay
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of (um) crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
<malay>lepas kita kahwin lepas kita kahwin</malay> I <malay>dapat tahu yang perangai macam mana</malay> I <malay>dapat tahu macam mana</malay> you <malay>punya cara</malay> you everything I learn throughout the five years
because okay but this is what my one of my <malay>makcik cakap</malay> auntie lisa [lah] she told me that
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
<malay>orang ketiga ke apa</malay> #alhamdulillah# I'm so happy I'm so thankful that there's no <malay>orang ketiga</malay>
[kan] ya so just to ask you again but (um)
we go through like a lot of stuff [lah] eventually until now even though it's
it's almost six years already (um) we are not (uh) blessed with a child yet but no matter what I'm still blessed with (uh) being with you [lah] okay so (um) <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] I <malay>nak tanya</malay> you what was on your mind
okay (uh) <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah kahwin</malay> okay once you <malay>dah habis</malay>
all the <malay>nikah</malay> right and then (um) all the <malay>sanding semua dah habis</malay> [kan] and then outside then (um) <malay>kat dalam bilik</malay> <malay>dah makcik-makcik semua dah balik dah mandi dah siap semua nak tidur</malay> [kan]
but what was on your mind [eh] <malay>dalam otak</malay> you <malay>tu apa</malay> you <malay>fikir macam</malay> it was for me like I <malay>fikir macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku dah kahwin</malay> [lah] [seh]
<malay>aku dah aku dah</malay> I'm like all these responsibilities <malay>macam</malay> !fuh! [dah] jatuh kat kat</malay> I [lah] then I <malay>rasa macam</malay> [eh] I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] like like really I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] I <malay>tak sangka</malay> I <malay>dah kahwin</malay> and then [ah] so I was like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>takpe</malay> #lek# even even like few days like after the wedding
when I want when I woke up right I can't believe there's someone there's a guy beside me I was like I actually about to shout there <malay>lepas tu macam</malay> [oh] wait wait wait <malay>kau dah kahwin</malay>
okay so that was like (uh) that but it wasn't a big thing yet [ah] [ah] but for you what what's on your mind <malay>bila</malay>
you <malay>bila</malay> all this <malay>dah habis</malay> [kan] and the <malay>sanding</malay> part <malay>semua dah habis</malay> what's on your mind from your like marriage kind of thing
ya
ya then like because the thing is that (uh) okay regarding about the call right <malay>dia macam mana</malay> [tau]
because the thing is that <malay>kalau</malay> you call because where I'm living alone I don't have anything like to even as your mum also she be more worried like if like the father your father is he at home <malay>ke tak</malay>
[ah] not because (um) <malay>curang ke apa</malay> [lah] [ha] but it's more to like <malay>macam</malay> (um) like you <malay>pukul berapa nak balik</malay> I mean like worried [tau] worried (uh) you you also did because the thing is that
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dah jadi isteri</malay>
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
where are you <malay>tu semua</malay> and stuff like that then it's like also one another thing is that I'm alone at home anything that can happen like <malay>macam kalau malam</malay> alone not that good [lah] [kan] cause it's like <malay>macam</malay>
I can't say that the neighbourhood is actually quite good [lah] thank god we've got a good neighbourhood [ah] but no people like any tom dick or harry <malay>ke apa ke</malay> you call <malay>dia orang nak</malay> strike strike <malay>malam apa betul tak</malay>
[ha] so I <malay>tak suka</malay> [lah] [kan]
then (um) so another thing is like respect [lah] also then when you respect my decision of talking you I mean telling you [ah] <malay>bila</malay> [eh] you <malay>ni bila nak balik ni semua</malay> then you respond okay at least I know actually I just need a respond that's all
ya <malay>tapi</malay> there's the I mean mostly you like about that [lah] [ah] but one thing about him like you <malay>tak kasih</malay> I you <malay>kasih</malay> I <malay>bebas</malay>
<malay>kebebasan</malay> also so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> happy [lah] [ha] so ya that was why ya okay that was on your mind [lah] like responsibilities and stuff like that also right
okay so the next one is like what you enjoy on this marriage and everything what thing I enjoy right and I found out [lah] yang <malay>kita ni ada banyak kesamaan</malay> in terms of like movies
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
ya and then like <malay>macam</malay> movie <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) marvels (uh)
some movies of course they some movies that you don't like <malay>macam</malay> harry potter you don't like <malay>tapi</malay> (um) lord of the ring you like and then
(um) some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
(err) so <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] give and take [ah] stuff like that (uh) then but then but the most thing that we enjoy
is travelling [kan]
<malay>tak sama serupa</malay>
(mm)
ya
!chey! that was a punishment though
[eh]
<malay>jap</malay> at that time you <malay>belum apa</malay> at least one time only but the thing is that when that day that time happened right
I don't know [eh] [oh] I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me [ah] I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry [ah] because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
meticulous [lah] <malay>macam semua benda</malay> I <malay>mesti macam</malay> make sure that everything [eh] <malay>mesti macam</malay>
goes well [lah] (uh) because I <malay>punya orang tak macam itu</malay> [tau] I <malay>punya orang tak macam</malay> [eh] <malay>tak jadi pergi sini</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> [ah] due to this and that and this and that I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>rasa risau</malay> [ha] but I think that time
I I say to myself maybe there's a reason why I'm not supposed to go there but eventually on that day [eh] <malay>kita macam</malay> [eh] on that time we actually had fun [eh] [ha] better correct we we had even more because it was impromptu <malay>macam tak</malay> plan <malay>apa</malay> and <malay>lepas tu kita terus</malay> like (uh) okay just dive [ah]
<malay>kita pergi</malay> cameron and port dickson
<malay>duit ada</malay> so I <malay>macam</malay> okay I <malay>terjun</malay> [jer] [ah] [ha] so it was <malay>macam</malay> it was fun [lah] it was fun <malay>kita pergi</malay> honeymoon <malay>tu semua</malay> and then we get to know each other we eventually we get to know more about each other then (uh) travel then
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also [lah]
(uh) then he he can drive well [ha] <malay>naik atas semua</malay> and then because that one also is my first time I went out to (um) holiday without my parents in my whole entire life
I have always travelled with my parents I never like travel alone <malay>ke pergi dengan kawan ke</malay> or <malay>pergi</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> boyfriend <malay>apa tak pernah</malay> my my travel is usually just my parents so usually like
the hotel tickets <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>orang lain dah siapkan dah</malay>
no [lah] but then but
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] [ah] but one thing is just like it's just fun [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's it's one thing like I feel like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! [dah] [dah] start into responsibility end up okay <malay>dah tahu macam mana nak</malay> book hotel <malay>tu semua lepas tu dah tak tak habis-habis</malay> stop <malay>tak</malay> <malay>asyik</malay> book hotel [jer] <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday [jer]
ya
actually <malay>ada banyak juga</malay> for #bandung# but <malay>ada tapi kita tak tak</malay> venture <malay>ke sana</malay> [lah]
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then (um) like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
I regret <malay>tak kumpul duit banyak-banyak lepas tu kahwin</malay> but then again I <malay>rasa</malay> this is still the right time because the thing is that
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that (um) we wanted to do [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam kita tak boleh buat macam</malay> (uh) and then (um) but then again after I <malay>dah berapa tahun yang</malay> I realised that
I shouldn't rely on people <malay>punya</malay> kind of marriage and my kind of marriage cause
I find that because I <malay>rasa</malay> [kan] the time I I
I <malay>macam suka ikut-ikut orang</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia ni ada</malay> bag dior I <malay>pun nak</malay> bag [ah] <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>nak pun nak</malay> I I <malay>pun nak pergi makan kat sini makan kat</malay> cafe <malay>ni semua</malay> but then after awhile then I realise
I think it's not supposed to be our kind of wedding [lah] our wedding supposed to be like <malay>macam</malay> our kind of marriage is supposed to be something that is just us
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
like a lot of my friends success friends so one thing about them is that that <malay>dia orang suka</malay> (um)
they do their own way marriage [lah]
[ah] so that's why [lah]
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so (um)
can I just ask you another question [ah] before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me [lah]
cause of course I know I got lot of flaws also and !hey! you <malay>jangan cakap</malay> you <malay>pun tak ada</malay> flaws <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] [ha] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like
you you got any regrets of the marriage itself like for example [kan] <malay>macam kalau dulu</malay> you <malay>tahu kalau</malay> before <malay>kahwin</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>kalau kalau tak kalau</malay> you <malay>kahwin</malay> you can play endless car <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] freedom yes you are the freedom to do whatever you want to meet your friends also have can anything but (um)
after marriage maybe you find like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>nak kena layan dia ni</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak kena pergi sini nak pergi sana</malay> I cannot do my stuff and stuff like that do you have any regrets [ah]
(mm)
but do you have any regrets of marriage not wedding [oh] <malay>macam sekarang</malay> [ha] <malay>macam</malay> for me [kan] I <malay>tak</malay> regret
okay because I I'm okay with marriage but (uh) <malay>macam</malay> being
but I know that there's certain things that I cannot do when I'm married [ah] [ah] but one thing about you you don't you don't let <malay>macam</malay> [ah] give me to <malay>kongkong</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like
I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do that [kan] [ha] <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>kasih</malay> I freedom of what to do like for example even this (uh) recording screen <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
some people will find it <malay>macam</malay> the guys don't let like like you know they don't let the wife do this and stuff like that some
find that if the the lady wanted to do business or what the guy don't give [ha] so <malay>macam</malay> it's a lot of things like like the guys don't really <malay>macam</malay> into it [lah]
[ha] <malay>cakap nanti berselerak</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>kemas tu tapi macam tak boleh macam marah</malay> [lah] [kan] so so eventually <malay>macam</malay> not all guys can actually accept this [ah] so actually one thing I I happy [lah] I <malay>dapat kahwin dengan</malay> you so I happy that this thing doesn't occur to me much
which I find it <malay>macam</malay> funny [ah] because that time I wasn't planning [mah] to get married so after get married this guy wasn't like really thinking [eh] this guy okay or not [ha]
eventually he is like one okay guy [lah] so okay [lor] okay last question
last question [lah] I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me [ah]
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding [ah] marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
I I <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh] <malay>kalau</malay> you cheat I cannot like if you cheat like
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity (uh) I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault [ah] it's your fault but then (um) there's no such thing as #tercheat# [ah]
#ter# #ter# there's no such thing as that one for for what I know [lah]
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me [lah]
[ha] if you do have another girl outside or what then (um) that was one of my biggest fear [lah] I have I don't have like small small fear but then <malay>macam</malay> that one I think that if that happen <malay>terus</malay> cut [ah]
[ah] and also <malay>pukul</malay> [lah] but then I there wasn't any hit or anything [ah] I'm I'm still as fluffy as possible but then I'm not a bruises or anything [lah] (uh) so (um) okay for you is there any biggest fear about this marriage
(uh) like for example anything [ah] that you think like <malay>ada ke apa</malay> biggest fear [lah]
ya correct [ah] then about (uh) then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people [ah] that one
(uh) never give me stress also because like the thing is that (um) in-laws right
some in-laws [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> there is I is not pretty and the in-laws don't accept which is to me <malay>macam</malay> I I that's one of my fear like when I get to know your mum <malay>ke apa</malay> and then your mum don't like me <malay>akan cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni</malay> [sia] [eh] sorry sorry I didn't your mum won't say like that
anyway like [eh] <malay>asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni</malay> [ha] [dah] [lah] <malay>gemuk tak lawa tu semua</malay> but then it's like
not like that [ah] your your parents are not like that ya they are very welcoming and they are and we actually did slept before waiting out we did actually (um) (uh) <malay>apa ni tinggal kat rumah mak mertua</malay> so we were like
okay [lah] still got we we there was a bond there [ha] and now (uh) we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then
(uh) we want to create our own family here [lah] [ha]
so okay just just before we end all this finishing
is there any future (um) request
as a husband towards me for
featuring guest [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (uh)
let's say if you want anything that you expect for the next like ten twenty years okay let's say just ten years [lah] we are already in our
six years and then <malay>macam kalau</malay> you want to have another what what what is your no request [lah] what is your future plans for the next four years before we step into that ten year <malay>punya</malay> anniversary ya
[oh] my god do I know this
okay I think (uh) because (um) for the last past five months [eh] five years I have been like driving you crazy [kan] okay the thing is that (um)
okay [ah] I for me for the next like about maybe around ten years before we reach that mark ten years mark I wish that we have
a a small family [lah] like another (um) junior
either junior girl or junior boy doesn't matter that (uh) another person [ah] in our family [lah] [kan]
[ha] to join us <malay>apa semua tu</malay> so I wish that <malay>kita</malay> our financial also is doing good and everything and then (um) healthier family and also (um) slimmer but until now also [dah] five years also still not slim so
ya [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah] just just saying only
yes because I want to be healthy by the time I'm
getting older you know I don't want to be like like sixty already and then cannot breathe already you know something like that
okay so (um) I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually (uh) know
about you more [lah]

(mmhmm)
[oh] my gosh
I think out of all the people you know right like how much I love to use SIRI every like every (err) (err) everything that we want to search on google I'm always hey SIRI and <malay>dorang tak faham</malay> like <malay>dorang selalu macam</malay> give me some weird (err) weird like response
and I'm like that's not what I'm asking so this project will be cool [lah] honestly I can understand you know
(mmhmm)
<malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>I macam malas nak taip</malay> okay so SIRI suppose to be the convenient option right it's suppose to be more convenient it's suppose to bring more convenience to your life <malay>tapi</malay> it's like double job [ah] I I I don't mind it honestly I don't mind it <malay>tapi</malay> you you <malay>yang selalu macam</malay>
babe you might as well just
type it in and then like I don't know then it doesn't it doesn't become fun anymore you know
but still I like
ya I guess I wonder if can actually if people were to really use SIRI
for their day to day like everything is SIRI [seh] because I think they have like like google home or like alexa right those I think those ones are a bit more receptive a bit more <malay>macam</malay> how do I say like (err) they can do more commands maybe but for SIRI <malay>macam</malay> everything <malay>tak boleh</malay>
ya
maybe not yet [eh] correct
[oh] really
[oh] ya ya ya ya
has to be [ah] ya ya ya right wait so do they is apple home a thing here in singapore
<malay>kita</malay> just <malay>tak kaya</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tak kaya</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
ya so if my phone can actually <malay>macam faham</malay> what I'm saying from time to time it would be nice [lah] I would I would appreciate it a lot [lah]
[ah] okay okay let's think of a scenario okay maybe <malay>raya raya kita pergi rumah dorang</malay>
okay <malay>salam</malay> hey <malay>selamat hari raya selamat hari raya</malay>
[oh] I <malay>makcik</malay> I I <malay>yang makcik</malay> [eh] !wah! okay

[oh] okay [lah] so <malay>pakcik tu akan cakap</malay> (err) hey SIRI make it hotter
[ah] make it warmer (mm) (mm) okay okay okay
[kan] yes it like that always happens like what's the point [lah] honestly I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] [what]
[ah] true true ya
ya
I hope <malay>dorang macam</malay> it's it doesn't become like one of those (err) you know the movie her
like okay okay so the this guy [eh] okay I kind of forgot what he does or whatever but the essence of the story is that he (err) <malay>macam</malay> fell in love with the so <malay>macam</malay> because the became <malay>dia punya kawan</malay> like the only companion that he had or not maybe not only companion but the one that he feels <malay>paling faham</malay> like <malay>paling</malay> understanding
something like that like so <malay>dia macam</malay>
ya I guess so so he ended up falling in love with the but the is not capable [lah] to love him back so it like it became like a
very (err) <malay>macam</malay>
existential crisis kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> [oh] no what's going to happen to me whatever whatever so ya that's kind of cool
(mm) true
(mmhmm)
!wow!
learning the dictionary okay good good good good
got (mm)
the rapper
(mm)
it is kind of cool [lah] actually <malay>macam</malay>
when you say you learn the dictionary
when
when
it in this recording he said that <malay>tak tak dengar</malay>
I <malay>cuma dengar</malay>
no okay let's not let's be good citizens but anyway <malay>macam</malay> [ah] I think it's a good thing what he did only because like he made use make good use of the time you know of a bad situation he made it into a good one and
look at him best maybe top fifty rappers I don't know what to say [lah] I don't know I'm not a great fan of but (mm)

(um) like you <malay>macam lupa</malay> life before COVID <malay>mana</malay> concert (err) (err) indoor stadium <malay>ada</malay>
(err) you know what's weird like (err) I've been to concerts <malay>dekat</malay> big box and I feel ya
(err) (err) don't know but I think it's like the third or fourth level something like that and then <malay>dia macam</malay> (um) it's like a big
empty space
you know like there's the stage and and and all but it's like a standing pit [ah] I guess then
no but maybe maybe different concerts different but I think I've been to two concerts there and both the concerts is (err) like standing and I think it's weird because <malay>macam</malay>
#jurong# is not like okay #jurong# could be the town area of the west
maybe
kind of like JEM you know westgate like all the the malls there <malay>tapi macam</malay> to have a concert like the the the artist from wherever they are flying from they will be travelling
to #jurong# so they will feel like you know like I I guess you get the real or like you get a sense of like (err) a bit more <malay>macam</malay> authentic singapore but
like weird [lah] to have a concert there cause it's like <malay>sebelah dia</malay> is like furniture shop you know the furniture shop <malay>tempat makan</malay> I guess <malay>macam</malay> what
like on a daily is it [orh]
it's like you ya you have to <malay>buat</malay> research <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] like you cannot straightaway
(mm)
what
[oh] really shell out
ya I don't
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
is it in the the food court or is it like <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>tempat makan</malay> on its own
[oh] [oh] like I I probably have been to that food court and the food court that okay the the stall that I love so much <malay>dekat sana</malay> is
(um)
the #naan# [oh] my god the indian food <malay>dia punya</malay> #naan# is I think two dollar fifty and <malay>sedap gila</malay> and like the <malay>dia punya</malay> [ah] butter chicken <malay>macam tak tak</malay> [ah] <malay>lokek</malay> super <malay>sedap</malay>
I know <malay>macam dengar</malay> you <malay>punya mulut macam berair liur macam</malay> you know
(mm)
ya that's true
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
not for more than just <malay>satu</malay> occasion ya
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
[oh] okay <malay>pasal</malay> like it's every <malay>macam</malay> not say it's everywhere it's like it's not just one specific place where all #kurtas# are it's like everything is everywhere ya I get it
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
and <malay>mahal gila</malay> like <malay>kita pula dia</malay>
how much was your #kurta#
okay
still okay
(mm)
[oh] <malay>murahnya</malay> you shouldn't gotten that [one]
ya
okay <malay>kedai apa</malay> because I <malay>pernah makan dekat</malay> #tekka# <malay>punya</malay> market and there's a certain stall <malay>yang sedap</malay> also like it's not bad
is it <malay>dekat</malay> entrance you know there's the bus stop
escalator escalator
ya
I <malay>menang</malay> [seh]
ya so I <malay>macam</malay> very competitive
and like <malay>macam</malay> you know like like it's time I win something or more among your friends
so I had to win that game
or actually not had to win that game is like whatever opportunity I I <malay>boleh</malay> I <malay>akan menang</malay> [lah] but it was it was fun I love I love hanging out with your friends
(mm)
(mm) like honestly same to me <malay>macam</malay> I'm not really surrounded with people <malay>yang</malay>
really play a lot of board games at home or my own friends they don't really do that but I feel like ever since I met your friends <malay>dorang</malay> like are really
I don't know maybe if it's in their nature <malay>yang dorang</malay> not the most (err) not say friendly not the most social <malay>macam</malay>
in terms of talking or whatever with new people so that was a very good ice breaker like but I don't know if it applies for everyone because some people might not like board games some people might find it boring and that's the starting thing that they do they might lose interest already but I love I love games (err) and this just brought me back to
early times [ah] I guess
ya but not a lot like I it only I think only this year then I learn how to play monopoly <malay>betul-betul</malay> ya (err) before that I <malay>tak tahu sangat macam mana nak main</malay> monopoly deal also I <malay>tak tahu main</malay>
(mm)
this is the thing okay the only thing I played [eh] a board games <malay>macam betul-betulnya</malay> board games <malay>macam</malay> meaning you are the board <malay>macam</malay> not card games or whatever first okay <malay>kita</malay> just board games was the game of life
I I think <malay>masih ada kat rumah</malay> but I have to find it
(um) the game of life is basically
okay everyone will start at a point where okay <malay>kau nak belajar ke kau nak</malay>
[ah] start <malay>kerja</malay> straight it's literally like this it's literally life decisions [ah] that will make you ponder about what to do next <malay>tapi dia macam</malay> fast forward <malay>gila</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> after maybe a few turns you <malay>dah</malay> graduate [lah] (err) then for those <malay>yang macam dah</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> after a few turns towards the ending you <malay>dah ada anak</malay> you know you <malay>dah</malay> get married you <malay>dah ada anak</malay> so it's like it's very fast <malay>tapi</malay> it's quite fun (err) so that's the game of life
no I've never played that also when I was young so snake and ladders was only because your friends you know <malay>macam</malay> introduced me to board games and shit !oops! sorry (err) introduced me to board games [eh] I wanted to [ah] bring that board games to
my friends so we went out one day looking for board games
and that happens to be one of them and I don't know how to play snake and ladders
officially like official game rules I don't know how to play like to me <malay>macam</malay> snake <malay>naik atas ke turun</malay> I don't know [ah] ladders <malay>boleh turun ke naik atas</malay> you know like I don't know which one is which (err) I don't know proper dice rules also <malay>macam</malay> (err) you know like if you (um)(ppo) get the same ya exactly or snake and ladders I think <malay>cuma ada satu</malay> dice <malay>satu</malay> die so so you get six you can go another turn that kind of thing ya like I don't know I don't know so it was that was the first time also I played with my friends (um) but before that so there was the game of life when I was younger
and then there was
<malay>dia macam</malay> aeroplane [eh] ya I I <malay>ingat</malay> and I think I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>pernah main juga</malay> but I <malay>tak pernah</malay>
like research how to <malay>main betul-betul</malay> ya
(mm)
like <malay>kita</malay> lend or <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>kita</malay> will put into groups and play I don't know but pick up sticks was one of my favourites also like I love to play that game
pick up sticks
ya
it's the one <malay>yang</malay> you cannot move the thing right
why
okay okay okay okay according to my understanding
different colours have different points
so the like maybe a a certain colour has the most point
whatever it is okay [lah] some people will think strategically <malay>dorang nak amek</malay> the one with the highest points some people are like just take as much as you can and accumulate all the points
so but whatever it is okay it will start with how to explain it [eh] all the sticks in one hand okay and only one person does this <malay>dah</malay> one hand and then <malay>dorang</malay> just <malay>lepaskan</malay> that's it
so
I think is I think as many I don't know [lah] but like only one person have to do that and then <malay>dia lepaskan</malay> [kan] so it's like everywhere right scattered ya so like each person just have to take one by one [lah]
so okay okay no no not one by one it's when it's your turn you try to take as many as possible then the moment the move the next person go
ya
(mm)
ya which is okay <malay>tapi</malay> sometimes even the one at the top can <malay>tergoyangkan yang</malay> the other one
ya so the moment any sticks move then it's someone else's turn
back then [eh] ya
[oh] ya ya ya
okay I <malay>tahu</malay> about that ball I don't know what you do with that ball like <malay>macam</malay> is it supposed to be a throwing game or what but yes I do remember that paper ball yes
(mm)
I
[oh] #congkak# yes
for a moment I <malay>macam</malay>
in my whole life I <malay>tak pernah cakap tu dekat siapa-siapa</malay> so <malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>cakap tu dekat</malay> you I <malay>tak tahu main</malay> #chapteh# no (err) I I think I'm pretty bad at #chapteh# (err) for people who can play what's that called <malay>yang</malay> the #sepak takraw# I salute like cause it's kind of similar right you <malay>pakai kaki</malay> like flick the thing up like I think #sepak takraw# is harder than football or soccer ya so I ya I really really salute people who can play #sepak takraw#
[ah] but side track back to what we which one were we talking about which game
#congkak# yes I actually really like #congkak#
okay
I I I think it's better if you play it and also this recording is going to be vet by other people I <malay>tak tahu kalau</malay> the rules <malay>betul ke tak</malay> completely <malay>tapi</malay> basically like [ah] I I really want to play with you like this game so maybe I think we should get but okay #congkak# gives me this memory from primary school okay so primary school ya let's go way back in primary school
<malay>kita ada</malay> this one corner
where it's like a #kampung# where it's design and and like (err) painted in a way that looks like a #kampung# so there was like hopscotch on the floor there were games here and there
ya (err) ya I'm trying to think whether my primary school was like a
ya I was from woodlands [lah] so
<malay>macam kampung-kampung</malay> [eh] like but okay
(mm)
ya ya
(err) with the steps as well like it was like (err) I don't know how to explain [ah] okay paint wall right to look like the house right and there's like a platform with the steps to make it look like you <malay>tengah naik atas</malay> the ya to the to the <malay>macam</malay> what's that call like a patio <malay>luar</malay> the #kampung# like outside part of the house
okay ya the <malay>serambi</malay> and then like you know okay so over there they will like not say cabinets [ah] like shelves of games you can play so #congkak# was one of them
(mm)
like something similar right okay [lah] <malay>dah tak</malay> special
(mm) ya something like that ya ya ya (mm)
yes yes that [one] is like the spider spider plastic spider
ya that [one] never play before
so [oh] that [one] also <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam</malay> eraser
the ya
(err) I never played but there was a point where like I would have a few of the country <malay>punya</malay> flags [ah]
[oh] ya it's always like the hardest to find [eh] singapore (err) but I never had singapore <malay>punya</malay> flag
how
okay yes correct but that's like the cheating way
ya [oh] my god the amount of money you can get if of that singapore flag
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] !wow! <malay>apa tu</malay> it's like a what subscription box of erasers you don't know what you're going to get but each month you get or each week you pay
five two dollars ya entrepreneurial skills
I don't know it's okay
entrepreneurial I think so entrepreneurial skills
I do want to have
wait by the way I am twenty four currently I am working [ah] full time right now (um) in an office I work in an office job for a business school
(um) so I'm just giving you a bit of context [lah] [eh] (um) I do
think that one day I want to have my own business
or my little my like a small company or something
(um) and hopefully it will happen [lah] but till then <malay>macam</malay> it's not my biggest priority as of this moment because I feel like you know I want to be at a <malay>macam</malay> okay there are different goals that I want to achieve in life and right now that's not like what I want to achieve at this point
like there are other goals I want to achieve first
and then when I am a bit more stable when I got a bit more capital and I feel like it's (err) and a time where I'm more comfortable
to
go with the business I would
(mm) cause I think (err) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) in any company in any business there's going to be a loss you know but I feel like if I lose now it's too much of a loss ya so I want to be a bit more comfortable first and then
the company
no like (err) <malay>macam</malay> I understand this is a goal that I want in the future
but if I want to push that goal forward I cannot do it now like I don't think I can ya ya maybe <malay>macam</malay> the planning [lah] planning maybe <malay>boleh</malay>
but <malay>macam kalau</malay> I <malay>nak buat sekarang</malay> execute everything <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't think I can yet
that that idea is taken away that's true but I feel like one of the essence of being an entrepreneur is envision
innovation and the ability to like
it's not say be creative or whatever it's like
finding the next thing like you know that (err) sometimes being an entrepreneur is not just about the product it's about you and like how you can face certain like situations like for example if someone takes your idea
they cannot take away your entrepreneur skills
or your you know like you whatever it is you can still sell or whatever or you can still find the next big thing the next idea like but it's on you [lah] someone can have the same product but they cannot sell as good as you for example you know so I'm not too worried I do I do understand that <malay>macam kita dah</malay> discuss the idea we really love it we we think that you know this could be something
but I think for now no [lah]
SIRI hey SIRI what's the meaning of entrepreneurial
entrepreneur definition thanks SIRI
in terms of business or just in life
business [eh]
okay ya desi perkins is a youtuber that I really really like I follow her for a while already (um) on youtube I've watched her grow from when it was just her making makeup
(um) tutorials to her starting vlogs to then her <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>buka</malay> her own [ah] no no not <malay>buka</malay> [ah] she collab with major makeup companies
so that's like the starting right like the first step is like collabs right and then after doing the collabs and she actually collaborated <malay>dengan</malay> this <malay>satu</malay> sunglasses company
and then after that sunglass company the collab and then did a few more collabs here and there that's when she started her own company of like these glasses but okay like as much as I love her
(um) like her story
[ah] okay and my respect about the start that company in the middle of her pregnancy which is like both her babies you know like
[ah] like she gave birth to both her babies but ocean ya it's very nice but (err) that's not my <malay>macam</malay>
my number one idol when it comes to business
(err) I don't know if I look up to anyone
so much like I don't have anyone in mind other than for now rihanna
(err) ya ya fenty fenty became
a household name like okay like <malay>macam</malay> everyone knew fenty as like her name fenty rihanna robyn
yes yes yes I knew you were going to react that way like fenty is actually her real name like rihanna was a middle name or something like that ya [oh] no no robyn
robyn
robyn fenty
ya okay I ya either way it's not rihanna is not the actual like first name
it's like robyn robyn fenty something like that I don't know okay but anyway like fenty I maybe fenty was like a very strong family name or something I don't know I don't remember but but fenty became
such a global phenomenon <malay>macam</malay> and it's because [kan] like she had the okay business is business you get money money is whatever you know like that's the goal of any business to make money to make profits right <malay>tapi</malay> the way she did it [eh] because she started with the makeup and the makeup brand the way she did it was
inclusivity was diversity was <malay>macam</malay> (err)
just something that can be used by everybody and not leaving anyone out and I love that's about it comes from someone who went through that
<malay>macam</malay> maybe you know there are certain shades that doesn't match her or certain (um) products that are not the most friendliest to <malay>macam</malay> that kind of skin tone
and like she kept that in mind
no actually it's not even kept that in mind that became the driving force of all her products
like the first brand to have foundation of like twenty plus shades
you know usually it's like maybe half of that amount or like even lesser you know and it's really respectable [lah] so ever since that that makeup and and I think all the other brands that she's been I mean all the other products [ah] like companies that she made
was probably like years in the making as well it's just that starting with that as the first business <malay>macam</malay> like it really
like gave her so much respect in that
like (err) area of business
so I like that the makeup and then she did lingerie after that right and then she has a Savage Savage fenty Savage fenty and then (um) she also has
(err) like a luxury line which I forgot [ah] I think it's just called fenty ya
I miss her music by the way
when it comes to business okay who do you look up to
wait for what okay yes yes
I okay we we're !wow! this is a good question like what
is success to me when it comes to business (mm)
I I think what success is
is like maybe [lah] for now
is
if I'm if I do something I'm passionate about
and I can earn from it like
as the main thing that I'm doing in my life <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>dah tak payah kerja dekat</malay> office I
<malay>dah macam</malay> my family is taking care of
like all those kind of worries <malay>dah tak ada</malay> and all I can focus on is my business
like I think to me that is success
but it's more of a personal thing it's not <malay>macam</malay> the company success you know maybe the company success is to get returns <malay>macam</malay> to get return customers maybe that's one way of like (um) success but for me is a personal thing when it comes to my own business is that [ah]
(mm) (mm)
hundred K you <malay>nak tahu tak kenapa</malay> I <malay>tanya tu</malay> <malay>sebab kat</malay> instagram I wish I wish <malay>tak</malay> [lah] but okay actually
it's not a scam like I I I'm very particular when it comes to like the things that we see online right but so instagram there's this account and I'm still trying to understand actually so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh faham</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> try to explain to me [ah] so there's this account that is called curated business curated businesses okay that's the handle how I found out about this was kendall [eh] kylie jenner posted a post of her with luxury bags saying you can win this plus seventy K
and if it comes from kylie jenner it has to be like you know legit right so okay so the steps were that you have to follow curated business and scott disick scott disick is the the [ah] kourtney #kardashian# <malay>punya</malay>
boyfriend ya the one with the kids but they never actually got married it's okay don't you don't have to but anyway so you have to follow all the people that scott disick follows so I realise that all the people that he follows are all businesses
okay so you have to follow and it was like seventy plus accounts seventy five I think so you you have to follow all of those and then just comment like like (err) the question was who are you going to share this seventy K with so all you had to do was (um) answer in the comments section who and just follow the businesses which I think it's a way to increase [kan] like real people you see it's not bought followers it's like real people <malay>punya</malay> accounts <malay>tapi</malay> the moment the giveaway is done <malay>orang akan</malay> unfollow [ah]
but it's just that like <malay>kalau orang tu terlupa</malay> then maybe the account is still there
ya go ahead
yes
(mm)
following ya correct
ya correct correct for all ya ya ya as in ya that's very true that's very true okay so ya maybe that's it
so (um)
(um) the account was giving seventy K seventy K
okay so <malay>lepas ni semua orang</malay> so seventy K plus like all the bags [tau] plus [tau] it's like and it's open internationally so like I wanted to see how legit it is again they have winners from different parts of the world they have from japan they have from mexico they have from

it's one of those things where you won't know until it actually happens you know or like you can think about it but will it happen this kind of thing so <malay>macam</malay> and some the person who won was from
I don't know I think it's the states [ah] florida or something it's not me [ah] they they said the results on friday I checked <malay>tak ada</malay> notification ya but ya like so (um)
[oh] I said I think in the answers I said my mum I said I wanted to help my mum first I said I had student loans to (err) to (um) settle I have a passion for music I want to pursue music and if possible I want to start my own little business so that was my answer like
that's what I'm going to do that's what who I want to share with kind of thing but it was just a brief thing like there's so much more right like I told you right like the plans and shit
ya so
fuzzy wuzzy like
!wow! fuzzy little hearty we should make a song
fuzzy little hearty (mm)
ya
ya
ya
wait so the amount wasn't exactly hundred K it was seventy K but round up
what what what
I might keep like one or two or two or three no it's a lot of bags like like
I think eight to ten bags so I would keep a few I don't have
ya
(mmhmm)
from kylie jenner exactly like it's proven that it was from kylie so that's true that's true that's true
I I think singapore quite <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] like
because the bags were different sizes <malay>macam</malay> there are some like the smaller ones there are like bigger like
almost luggage size kind you know like really big ones so I think is different for each but I think we can really make a lot of money from there [lah] but
I don't know maybe like I might not sell [lah]
and then let it appreciate value like that value exist
I don't know like in the future when it becomes a bit more vintage or something in the and I don't know I don't know either you're still gaining cause you didn't pay anything for it like you know
but okay anyway like ya so that was the competition
ya why [ah] you you ask me that before
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>seorang wanita yang suka</malay>
[oh] okay bag bag <malay>beg-beg apa</malay> what's like the
okay
it's okay it's okay so ya okay to get a understanding of women who likes
luxury goods or luxury bags or
okay
believe it or not like I have never like okay I think the most luxurious
probably like coach [ah] and coach is not even like
top tier ya like coach is like the bossini or the giordano of luxury brands ya ya ya basically I don't okay my mum use to
they use to work ya my mum used to work at coach
and then there was a point whenever I tweeted something <malay>macam</malay> my mum works at coach <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] then someone indirected me and said coach is the bossini giordano of luxury brands so that's when I <malay>macam</malay> okay I got to humble down but no but basically like (um) I haven't heard [lah] ya we're not representing it's just experiences personal
okay but anyway ya so I <malay>ni tak pernah masuk macam</malay>
like I would really like to own maybe something from chanel or gucci or versace these three these three I really like
(mm)
<malay>sebab orang-orang dekat dalam macam sombong sikit</malay>[ah] and very judgemental
ya but that's the thing like I think it comes with the experience because it's suppose to make you feel like
like [oh] I can afford this you know like so it comes with it [lah]
ya
so that's that with the luxury brands
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay sure
(mm)
(err) I don't know man I don't know <malay>dia punya</malay> price list [seh] like I think <malay>satu</malay> handbag [eh]
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> like
ya
I don't I think it's more expensive than that ya
<malay>empat ribu</malay> probably gets you the small zip (hmm) probably the small one small bag
maybe I don't know I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I <malay>tak pernah</malay> so
[ah] the keychain itself right
me too
but it's okay better times are coming and we will be fine
(hmm)
I don't know banking
banking finance because you know money is still money like
I don't know about hospitals maybe there's no pay cut but they are affected cause they have to work more hours
ya and we don't know if they are getting paid much more
ya in a in a in a way yes
go frontliners shout out
(mm)
you not actually nurse
just <malay>macam</malay> whether or not you'll be (mm)
I think you can
I think you will make a good nurse
I think you can
can you
<malay>macam banyak darah</malay>
no let's not talk about that but I don't have [lah]
<malay>macam banyak banyak</malay>
okay
wait I wanted to share something but I think that's not best to be shared okay nevermind moving forward
(mm) nurse [eh] maybe maybe I don't think I would good news
ya true
do they have to go to medical school
to be a doctor
I don't know
wait what are we doing with our lives I think it's
doctorate [lah]
doctorate degree
(mm)
<malay>kenapa cina</malay>
doctor #fazil#
doctorate
I <malay>tak ingat sangat tapi</malay>
and doctorate is like
cause okay the only reason why I <malay>betuk-betul tahu</malay> there's a difference is that remember there's a comedy that we watched the the one the (err) the doctor from
ya then he make fun of the people there early on he he's like he's like (err)
I believe there are some (err) owners here as well how you all get in this [one] have to pay you know like like he said something like that so it's a joke like I think if I think the doctorate one gets you a bit further [lah] I don't know
no no cause <malay>macam</malay> the people who listening to this probably <malay>dorang biol</malay> like you know
like we generally don't know okay we're sorry but
general practitioner !wow!
[ah] [ah]
ya
ya ya ya ya
!wah! bullshit
ya
a doctorate
ya ya ya ya exactly so the the the doctor <malay>punya</malay> salutation that's given it's not medical
ya like
(err) okay I work in a business school you know and I have I have a (err) not lecturer what's it call like a professor whose name is doctor C J maddox but she doesn't take medical she's in business ya doctor C J maddox doctor #banu# doctor shout out to all the business school teachers
I understand <malay>macam</malay> it's not something <malay>kita</malay> (um)
see for ourselves you know it's not a goal or like
like something we want [ah] basically not something we want for ourselves it is understandable <malay>kalau</malay> like you <malay>tak tahu</malay> the only reason I <malay>tahu</malay> is because of that comedy and I work in a business school like that it <malay>kalau</malay> I don't I don't know (mm)
<malay>apa kita tahu</malay> is just <malay>main</malay> game
ya <malay>kita nak main</malay> monopoly after this actually
(mm) game of life is not bad so they actually gave give you a wheel to spin it's not a dice
singlish (err) it's not that fun [lah]
it's okay [lah]
also teaching you about capitalism same thing
you know work have family
I don't know
no
capitalism it's just I guess freedom what no no no no no
what
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
sorry <malay>kita</malay> curse <malay>banyak</malay> [seh]
ya we are toning down a lot for this but okay
yes
<malay>tapi</malay> I trust you [lah] don't worry about that [oh]
nice
[oh] well you manipulated me
okay (err) in order to be my friend you don't have to laugh at everything I say it's just that <malay>macam</malay> that is a plus point [lah]
it's about if you have friends who always judge you for your jokes then it sucks right it's better if you if if if they have similar humour that is great that's kind of what I look for also in a like in a partner but
moving forward (err) ya but humour is humour is a huge thing for me
(um)
no
(err) <malay>kentang</malay> the way I say it <malay>kentang goreng kentang</malay> <malay>kentang kentang</malay> okay like the question shouldn't be what do I like eating it should be what do you not like eating cause like I can eat anything else except for these foods so it's like
I don't like beef unfortunately <malay>sebab</malay> to me <malay>macam</malay> a bit
next time okay then I'll explain further okay so or there are certain food that I don't like but okay to answer your question no like they don't have to like the same things that I do
in terms of food but we'll why because <malay>kalau dah nak keluar makan</malay>
ya but I've I've never said guys I don't eat beef can we not go here like I've never said that because that's very rare that a <malay>tempat</malay> will only sell that and there's nothing for me ya
ya like steak house probably still has like ya <malay>ayam</malay> (err) <malay>ikan semua</malay> okay (err) so ya I think it's still pretty okay
(mm) food is not like a matter in terms of like friendship
astons
(mm)
just that andes andes <malay>sedap gila</malay> and
ya okay so I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's called andes but <malay>kita</malay> actually <malay>dengar</malay> waiter <malay>cakap</malay> andes so
ya she also very vibrant
character yes shout out to her but (um) ya really like andes andes is like one of our go to date places
andes
ya [lah] we don't know if he's meditating or what but he was sitting under a tree when I was on the way like you know the car passes by the road sides and all right so that that it's exactly like that so he was just sitting under a tree minding his own business so I was like okay
he takes his breaks outside just sitting under the tree calmly okay so it's an assumption that he meditates or he probably doesn't he just like relaxing
ya maybe
ya what do I do to handle stress I can call all your reference !aww! but (err) I usually would I'm not
I I don't see myself as a person who keeps it all in that's not my kind of person [ah] but I'm very particular with who I share it with as well
so <malay>macam</malay> usually if I go through anything that's not
(um) like the best of times for me I would share it with the certain people like my boyfriend like (um)
maybe some like close friends as well so
so it like <malay>macam</malay> it reduces that (err)
that
stress [ah] to a certain extent sometimes you don't need someone to tell you or advice you whatever if someone's there to listen
just to be just to let a bit of load off your shoulders [ah] it'd be nice
ya
that is not that is not a main requirement and (err)
that is not a good thing also <malay>jangan berhutang-hutang orang</malay>
<malay>tetapi</malay> (err) what I think you're asking is more like
will they be down for you like will they be there for you and <malay>macam</malay> really support you in times of need yes
(mmhmm)
I
I guess that's like okay like having that friend is
<malay>macam</malay> (mm) there's pros and cons you know having a friend like that I feel like
probably would put you in check a bit more
(err) but what if you really got no other choice then hearing that is just going to make you feel more like terrible sometimes you know
(err) I would prefer a person who is down for you who will really really support you (um) sometimes it doesn't even need questioning you know so ya
you do
ya

I (um) my sister she used to [lah] she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
(uh) no <malay>ada dah dah habis dah</malay> she ya I think if <malay>sekarang</malay> I think is every friday I think the
the <malay>cerita</malay> is (uh) I think is called
<malay>lesung</malay> if I'm not wrong you can try you can try (uh) tune in every friday <malay>dekat</malay> #suria#
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong [lah]
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch
like I feel like I watch once a month <malay>sahaja</malay> no [lah] I'm not into
like the drama and all if I watch also I just watch it through like Netflix <malay>ke</malay> Viu or YouTube <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
now now I <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tengok apa-apa</malay> cause I like actually I am busy
like morning <malay>kerja</malay> then
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
<malay>bangun makan tidur</malay> kind of thing you know
if you not a if you just like (um) afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school !haiyo!
!huh!
!wow! I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try [lah] try to be on time [lah] it's school it's important
me graduate
(uh) still still <malay>lama lagi</malay> I think now like
I started school (err) this year april
so it's only been how many months
(uh) few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
(hmm) looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so [lah]
then [eh] you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
[oh]
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
(mm) I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside

get to play rugby although it's your hobby
(uh) no I take care of myself very well
(um) like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
[ah] like you know like I say myself is chill but yourself is called you know <malay>cari nahas</malay>
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay [lah] since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
[oh] really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
[oh] good [lah]
(hmm) nevermind [lah]
like
right now [oh] you heard about like
(uh) I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
!huh! you <malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay> malaysia I can't wait to remove the mask
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
[oh]
it's okay [lah] we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
(uh) I really
really cannot <malay>tahan</malay> already people really need to follow like
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good [lah] you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
!wah! I really I like [oh] yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know (uh)
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
[ah] every month but now
like I heard like like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
[oh] !wah! everything you want to do with your friend [ah] then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
[oh] (uh) you heard talking about like and all you heard about like
(uh) government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure [lah] but like what it can be use for
[ah] cannot be anything I'm sure like <malay>mesti dia macam</malay>
only like certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
ya but you can only use your own voucher I think you must add up with <malay>pakai</malay> cash
relax what you so stress about
!wah! talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like (uh) allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
go #sentosa# <malay>untuk apa</malay>

it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
(uh) trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because (uh) apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same [lah]
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
<malay>dia naik habis</malay> suddenly <malay>dia turun</malay>
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
(uh) I think might as well you just take a train
I guess for you [lah]
what <malay>tak ada kena mengena</malay> car and roller coaster

it's unpopular opinion I know ya because I don't like to smile
so when I don't when I wear the mask people don't expect me to smile I mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya [lah] that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya I mean actually I'm not unhappy or you know I just have the (uh) the what they call the resting bitch face [ah]
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like [oh] hi welcome to <malay>apa apa apa</malay> you know then

my my resting face will go back during break time or something [ah]
you know
so ya but then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask [what] then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah]
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
you don't want to <malay>tegur</malay> like that then you just like !alamak! <malay>dia ni lagi</malay> then
hope they don't recognise me and think I'm just another malay girl
so I just like walk past them

<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya still searching [lah] that's why I I end up
about knowing this [lah]
ya
[a'ah] ya [lah] that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
that's why
my friend <malay>dia nak jadi</malay> temperature screener [kan] <malay>dekat kedai tu</malay> [kan]
then <malay>dia orang kata mesti ada</malay> diploma then I'm like
<malay>susah sangat ke</malay> temperature screener you know like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>tak</malay> makes sense [ah] I think <malay>dia orang macam sengaja nak</malay>
<malay>buat susah</malay> you know then they complain like you know [oh] nobody want to apply <malay>padahal</malay>
I don't know [ah] what's going on also

I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom <malay>gitu</malay>
then I mean
technically I think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
I don't know about you [lah] but ya
(mm) (mm) then
(mm)
(mm) ya usually they they like (um) and they like they prefer
registered people [ah] usually
but like
ya I
what
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's why I usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax [ah]
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (uh)
ya then now also like <malay>nak</malay> classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like <malay>macam</malay>
every hour <malay>kena</malay> sanitise <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] like (ugh)
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope [ah]
then <malay>macam malas gitu</malay> [ah]
ya but this one <malay>dia</malay> toxic [ah] the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the management [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ngada-ngada</malay> [ah] I don't know how to say
[ah]
that's why
ya
because I was there for training
then like the first three days the management <malay>tak datang</malay> so I'm like okay [ah] this job like not bad [ah] I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] can manage [lah] you know not so
not so terrible like I don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
(um) <malay>tengok</malay> how I work [lah] you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then <malay>dia orang</malay>
like they just like mood totally go down [seh] I don't know [ah] then
ya she damn <malay>cari pasal</malay> [ah] like with me like <malay>semua benda yang</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> which I think is like
not even her problem <malay>dia macam tak</malay> okay

because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training [tau]
then she say to me like (um) what [ah]

then I'm like isn't this what's the point of training like I
if I know everything why I training right like <malay>bodoh</malay> [pe] <malay>perempuan ni</malay>
ya
<malay>apa</malay>
ya ya
ya
she said twice [eh] in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting [what]
so (uh) she complain to the boss in chinese
(uh) then then I know what he what they she roughly mean [ah] I don't get like everything but I <malay>boleh faham sikit-sikit</malay> [ah]
so ya the I was I know already she talking about me and she say about how like
<malay>aku baru</malay> then <malay>aku tak tahu apa-apa</malay> you know things like that then I'm like
fine whatever just
keep quiet [ah] then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
or is it the next day or something like that then she like <malay>tegur</malay> me [ah] she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like [eh] <malay>kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa</malay> then <malay>kau orang nak</malay> test <malay>aku</malay>
but then I'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously I passed [lah] because I do have the
credentials like
I know what I'm doing [lah] basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I (uh) obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do [lah] because
I know how to do [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I managed to pass the test [lah] then she was like okay actually (um) I think you can
do okay you can quite teach [lah] but then
(uh) you don't know anything so I (uh) that time I'm just like <malay>malas</malay> [seh] <malay>nak datang balik</malay>
ya so that one gone [ah]
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>biar dia cari orang lain</malay>
you want <malay>kira</malay> work from home [ah] I don't want [seh]
(err)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
but in in terms of what do you mean
like
(mm)
[ah]
[oh] you mean [ah] are you like developers or
not really
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya
!wah! that's interesting [ah] I was contemplating learning that
ya because (um)
upper course ya
that's cool [ah]
because I got media arts
(um) diploma advanced diploma ya
so I understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
(mm)
[a'ah]
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating [ah] so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
but then now I I see like <malay>macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua</malay> I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay [lah] I guess
ya
(mm) suffocating
like means what
[oh]
I don't know [eh]
my friends <malay>semua macam</malay> introvert <malay>dengan</malay> homebody <malay>juga</malay> so it was quite fun [lah] for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
you ask them to <malay>jumpa</malay> right like like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone [oh] I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like [eh] actually I don't feel like going out [ah] then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
#shiok# [ah] like we living our best life [ah] but then I suffocated in a sense that
(um)
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
too wild too long in that's why I'm like <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the things they do is just
[ah] ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy [lah] because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
[oh] (um) still the same also [lah] two but (um) I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird [leh] because (um)
like I'm the eldest [kan]
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
but then my parents <malay>dia orang macam nak</malay> my sis my younger sister to marry first
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] I think my relationship longer but my relationship (uh) I'm also attached to a non-muslim
so
ya it makes things more complicated [ah] I guess then my sister she <malay>macam</malay>
she attached <malay>dengan</malay> muslim guy so that's already one
barrier crossed and then
(um) she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree [lah]
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood [ah]
ya but she got the cert [lah] ya
no [lah] she working in those like F&B jobs [lah]
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know [eh]
<malay>macam sekarang</malay> right I was thinking like is it
better in the long run if you marry now or better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
marriage is just like <malay>macam</malay>
law legally binding law law [what] you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
[eh] but then you know what so scary [leh] like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) recently [kan] I <malay>baca kat</malay>
facebook [ah] now now got a lot of free time [what] so more time to browse facebook <malay>gitu semua</malay>
[ah] then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
!wah! then [ah] so if cause to me right <malay>macam kalau kita</malay> relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
need lawyer need to sign things all <malay>macam</malay> (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
(mm)
is it
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
(um) relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can (um)
get (uh) engaged and married [what]
[oh] okay that one also I don't know but normally [lah] normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya (mm)
I mean that's
(uh) that's from my experience [lah] I don't know whether
not like I got married before [lah] but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya [oh] this is how it's supposed to be [ah] I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
(err) (uh) (um) almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because (uh) first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous [what]
<malay>apa</malay>
sorry what
(uh) <malay>tak</malay> I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know <malay>rajin-rajin</malay> in the kitchen then <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
[oh] (um) #izzati# finally can get married <malay>gitu</malay> you know but then I'm just like
whatever [lah] you know ya ya so
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much <malay>kalau tahu</malay> I just
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun [lah] but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity [lah] I feel
why
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] my god
[ah]
but (uh) I think it's okay [ah] cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
<malay>apa ni</malay>
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
like #chiongster# also [lah] <malay>kerja banyak</malay> and things like that then my parents also not happy [ah] because like
supposedly twenty five <malay>kita kena dah</malay> married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off [lah]
[oh] okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy [lah] then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know [oh] I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay [lah] like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
(um) I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy [lah] you
so then how !huh!
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family [kan] but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> [lah] then what !huh!
girl [ah] ya ya ya my mum ya [lor] that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
<malay>kita pun ada cakap</malay> [ah] like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
(mm)
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that [lah]
but so far I've been going over they quite okay [leh] it's more like okay it's actually (um) my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how [lah] but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said [lah] we both like have our own place already
and then like okay [lah] maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period [lah]
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should already
ya because my friend like
they like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house [lah]
and the in-laws house
then she say it's like hell [lah] because the mother in-law <malay>macam</malay>
like have a lot of expectations of her <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
(mm)
but sometimes <malay>kecoh</malay> is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of <malay>kecoh</malay>
ya ya
because like
I feel
[oh] okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say (um) last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she <malay>cakap dia tak nak</malay> [ah] she <malay>nak cari rumah sendiri juga</malay>
so but then she say [lah] like in now these days a bit difficult [lah] but then
her ideal goal is still to move out [lah] ya
but then (ugh)
like
why you don't like the the the partner [ah]
(mm)
ya the okay
[eh]
ask her to get out [ah] really ya ya ya okay [dah]
(ugh)
ya ya ya
[oh] my gosh that's interesting [eh]
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
(mm) okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in #jurong# no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
like you know <malay>hari raya</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> like <malay>rumah kat</malay> #jurong# then <malay>mesti ada kucing punya</malay> I don't know [ah] I don't know how to say ya
ya
I never say [ah] <malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> [eh]
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought #jurong# was cool like the west side you know like [oh] cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of #yishun#
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay #jurong# a bit dodgy
[a'ah]
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of #jurong#
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
[oh] <malay>pergi</malay> #pasir ris# then I [oh] <malay>pergi</malay> #changi# okay then <malay>pergi</malay> #jurong# [ah] I
!wah! that sound so far away I don't know why
ya
(mmhmm)
yes it's true
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya that's right
(mm)
(hmm) do you like that or not
okay
(mm)
[oh]
those are touch and run away kind ya
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
<malay>seram</malay> [seh]
the what you do
<malay>apa</malay>
what the
[ah] ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
<malay>apa</malay>
watch group !wah! your parents also very ons [eh]
[ah]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm) interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
[oh] but recently my sister <malay>kena</malay> then I was like what the hell
ya but I don't think I can be like you [lah]
like the last three times (uh) people someone follow me home I just confront them I don't care
you are not wrong I'm also very small but I think I'm just
(uh)
more like like I think too well of myself
a bit overconfident [lah] <malay>dia orang kata</malay>
ya
so so it's like I'm like !oi! (uh) why you follow me like you know <malay>padahal</malay> I'm just a
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me [ah] want like ya
ya it's damn irritating I cannot stand it [ah] like what you say [ah]
sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> will follow from a distance which I can still like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat bodoh</malay> [lah] you know then
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
there was one guy who even like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> [kan] then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
empty [kan]
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then
[ah] ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door [ah]
and actually because I want to lean [ah] because I <malay>malas</malay>
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya !oops! I cursed
ya [lah] ya [lah] so I'm just like [oh] I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
recently [kan] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> I want to move to the west side because
most of the not most of the jobs that I want [lah] but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no [ah] #ang mo kio# also got industrial park [lah] but that one is different industry
but ya
ya so it's like <malay>macam</malay> I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
I mean not easier [lah] it will be
life you know like sometimes the the <malay>kerja</malay> is like so far away from your <malay>rumah</malay> then it's like (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> ya
so ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't (uh) what
(mm) ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
(um) ya
would you rather town or #tanjong pagar#
it's a bit far for me
(uh huh)
ya
I cannot [lah] I I just for me I feel I get
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
(ugh)
ya [lah] cause in #ang mo kio# like <malay>macam</malay> nobody ever sleeps
so it's damn irritating
then sometimes like three [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon</malay> then <malay>dia orang ketawa</malay> like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
[ah] I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons [lah] pros and cons
(mm)
ya
I don't know [ah] I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan [kan] like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID [lah] so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that [lah] like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
(mmhmm)
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
(mm)
obviously ya
interesting
ya [lah] ya [lah] such is life
<malay>apa</malay>
my plan
[a'ah]
but I think he don't want [lah]
because he also still studying then he want to like (uh) like what you say [lah] <malay>macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu</malay>
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long [eh] like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
<malay>sebab dia nak jadi</malay> teacher so now he studying the subject
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said [lah] he still need a teaching degree
because he wants to work at <malay>punya</malay> kind of school
then I'm just like !wah! that's very long [eh] that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't <malay>kerja</malay> you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that [lah]
[a'ah]
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that [lah]
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
say before that he is <malay>macam</malay>
like when he got school [kan] <malay>dia nak</malay>
study [jer] but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job [ah] so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
(uh) but then that semester break it I think is is <malay>macam</malay> charity
that's why just like normal expenditure [kan] it's not like saving for a house <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me [lah] sometimes I wish I just have a nice (uh) rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
(uh) you [lah]
[ah] <malay>cina</malay> [lah]
(uh) #qian jin# is a
actually I don't
I don't know [ah] like when back then like cause I was your age not so long ago (um)
I was workaholic also [lah] then <malay>macam</malay>
not really keen on getting married or getting attached even
you know so I'm just like

<malay>ada</malay> children all then in the end
I met him then I was like actually we can click [ah] then like so we fall
like in love so like not I'm in a relationship
so I don't know what to do with that dream
(mm)

online [lah]
[a'ah]
<malay>saje</malay> [jer] like you know like
like
try try cause nowadays got <malay>macam banyak</malay> apps <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] you know and websites also
so just make friends [ah] because I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
my age [kan] like <malay>orang semua dah kahwin</malay> then <malay>dia orang macam tak nak</malay> hang out so much
so I was like trying to like meet new people like of same interests as me you know
then
no no twenty five was when I don't want to get married
so in that course then I'm just like ya but then now it's like
I suddenly meet him then suddenly like [eh] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] actually like if we get married and have a life together <malay>macam</malay> fun <malay>gitu juga</malay> [eh] ya so

I'm just doing whatever I like and then
things fall into place so now I don't know ya what
ya ya so you were saying about your gaming thing

fan and I
the the the ya the
drama [lah] I don't know [lah] ya
ya ya ya
ya
!wow!
!whoa!
[eh] cool [sia]
(mm) ya I don't play fortnite
I mean I mean I've never play [ah] I don't know how it's like so ya
(mm)
like what
[oh]
(mm)
I will not last long in that
(mm) I think because of COVID right
I downloaded animal crossing so now I'm still addicted to it
ya
(mm)

you know
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay

ya
[oh] what it's just the same games over and over again [lah]
don't have
(uh) I don't even know what I want to call it
I guess you can say that !huh!
(uh)

(err) my day today was okay it was quite a slow day (uh)
because I didn't do much (uh) today
(um) I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work [lah]
I haven't actually applied for anything
(err) I was there was this (err) job link that #adli# sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
(err)
the job <malay>punya</malay> name if I'm not wrong it was <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly [lah] but then there was an addendum to the title
that said (uh) it was (uh)
malay language specialist
it should be [ah] or <malay>siapa-siapa yang boleh faham</malay> [ah] <malay>melayu</malay>
ya but the job <malay>punya</malay>
the job <malay>punya</malay> description !wah! was not that not that bad (uh)
basically just listen to
transcriptions [oh] sorry (err) listen to audio <malay>punya</malay> files
and then
transcribe them into
words [ah]
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
no I think it's like maybe <malay>macam</malay> <malay>punya</malay> type of thing (uh)
(err) natural language processing
ya ya basically [ah] but I think there's also another aspect of <malay>macam</malay>
(err) natural language processing <malay>punya</malay>
feel
which is more concern with (err) and machine learning
where the
the itself
actually (err) learns language
because [kan] you know <malay>ada ada</malay> debate [kan] whether language is
(err) nature or nurture <malay>macam</malay> whether there is a biological foundation for language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then (err)
so
so ya [lah] the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
the brain <malay>punya</malay> mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke <malay>tak</malay> whether the can learn
[ah] yes I will be part of that
[a'ah]
soon [lah] in a few days [lah] I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
because my results [kan] <malay>belum keluar</malay>
so like
I got no results
the
if I apply then like a bit weird (uh) but I'm quite sure I will pass [lah] so I think <malay>tak ada hal kalau nak</malay> apply [jer]
(err)
so far no (uh) except for a few that I saw (err)
special education <malay>punya</malay> teacher
<malay>kat</malay>
(err) wherever [lah] I think there's a few locations
because I fall into the <malay>macam</malay> the
no like (err) I I meet the requirements ya
(mm)
okay [lah] the exam was
only one exam was quite difficult (uh) the other three <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [jer] (uh) okay [ah] I did two of them quite well (err)
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and (err) second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy (uh)
the best [eh]
probably second language learning
!huh! why
no (uh) because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory [what] so it's more difficult to screw up
but at the same time <malay>kalau dia</malay> rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest <malay>punya</malay> score possible
ya ya I just want to pass
(mm) ya
your leave
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
wait pause they made you take
a test
[oh] so <malay>macam</malay> what are your strengths what are your weaknesses <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
[ah]
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya your boss's boss
wait he got cut off [oh] because the break up room <malay>punya</malay> time was ending
ya
(mmhmm)
!huh! how come your computer shut down in the room
[oh] so the
so basically the zoom thing crash [lah] nothing wrong with your computer [lah]
okay okay good
<malay>sebarang</malay> [jer] [siol] leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the <malay>benda ni</malay> compulsory [kan]
!whoa!
okay (uh)
I sat in the chair
<malay>belajar belajar</malay> all the way like for hours and hours straight
but it's okay [lah] I mean I managed to
(err) get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was (err)
for the eighteenth century <malay>punya</malay> lit
that [one] maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
<malay>tak</malay>
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want [ah]
I mean
it's work for me throughout the four years (uh) for all my lit <malay>punya</malay> courses [ah] plus I hate lit (uh) so
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
<malay>asal</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>apa dia</malay>
[ah]
then he suddenly appears
<malay>menyibuk</malay>
<malay>tak menyibuk</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tak cukup</malay>
<malay>tak cukup perhatian</malay>
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift [eh]
(mmhmm)
left <malay>maksud</malay>
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
so
so basically there was no person in charge [lah] for the thing
!wah! co in charge [lah]
on the ups
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
after six
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] <malay>kejap</malay> pause
but the appointment <malay>pukul enam pagi</malay>
[oh] okay okay
<malay>nak kena siap apa</malay> [seh] you just need to go over to the location [pe]
ya
(hmm)
so he's new
[ah]
(mm)
okay so he's not actually <malay>baru</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
[oh]
so so your shift doesn't deal with <malay>macam</malay> <malay>punya barang-barang</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> and (oo)
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
[eh] to whoever's listening
confidential okay
(mmhmm)
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> lost [ah]
the what thing
[oh] okay
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
(mm) (err) on the days you're schooling
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya
okay shift is what time to what time
<malay>tiga pagi juga</malay>
you
[oh] you cannot request for shift change [eh]
[oh] for your class [eh]
[eh] I think I destroyed your chair
[oh] okay
<malay>kita orang macam</malay> chair destroyers [eh]
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
(mm)
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
I mean even on your off days also most likely <malay>kena tidur</malay> [kan]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift <malay>punya</malay> thing (uh) <malay>pasal dulu</malay> #nasri# <malay>pun bila dia tengah kerja</malay> shift
I think you felt the same way in that
<malay>macam</malay> even on his off days his time was taken up by
<malay>tidur dulu</malay> because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
take a break if that makes sense
(mmhmm)
[oh] shit serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
justin bieber
[oh]
[oh] they are not big fans of justin bieber
(mm)
wait so so you mean different <malay>punya</malay> clients
have different workflows [eh]
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
[oh] ya [lah]
you better do it
ya
serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit (err)
weird
I think especially because <malay>macam lain-lain punya</malay> organisation <malay>ada lain-lain punya</malay> processes
so <malay>macam</malay>
like
there's no
solid base to work from within your own organisational <malay>punya itu</malay>
like it's dependent on the client rather than the <malay>itu</malay>
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you (uh)
the previous shift
<malay>terlalu banyak apa</malay>
complacent [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
I don't know (uh) I think
honestly to me
<malay>janji kerja dia habis dah habis cerita</malay>
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send (uh)
in what sense
(mm)
what what do you mean <malay>kena macam tu</malay> [eh] <malay>apa</malay>
first come first serve <malay>siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
(mm)
wait
<malay>pukul lima</malay> five in the morning
okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay>
[a'ah]
ya like you
and you don't want to be the kind <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tanya tanya tanya macam</malay> !oi! you want or not [eh] you want or not <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
like I have a feeling like usually the one <malay>yang</malay> step up is you and not all all those other people <malay>yang itu</malay>
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>ada apa</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
jaded
(mm)
[oh] okay
I was actually going to make a joke
<malay>pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>ada apa budak baru nama</malay> jaden [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> seniors <malay>dia</malay> jaded
so jaden <malay>dengan</malay> jaded <malay>sama-sama</malay>
never mind never mind let them cringe <malay>janji janji kita punya</malay> audio <malay>dorang dapat</malay>
[ah] okay [lah]
<malay>betul tak betul betul</malay>
(mm)
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
!huh!
ya ya they know we we also know
no no no it's like it's like <malay>bila kita orang dua orang</malay> [jer] <malay>berbual macam</malay>
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
<malay>kalau orang melayu apa</malay> [ah]
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker [eh]
no no there's there's
<malay>ada ada ada</malay> there's a there's a (uh) there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
<malay>macam</malay> like like [ah] is it
is it <malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I think it's <malay>kayu tiga</malay>
ya there's
no now that one person has more (uh)
malay vocabulary to transcribe
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
[oh] okay [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean we we're having
<malay>macam</malay>
ya ya
I don't know (uh) but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
[kan] it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine [ah] it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable [lah]
!aiya!
[ah]
[a'ah] [sia]
I mean maybe the design of <malay>dia punya</malay> blocks also plays a part [lah]
but at the same time <malay>tak</malay> [kan] you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time <malay>orang nak balik rumah</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] of course [lah] it's their job
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>orang sia-sia</malay> [jer] <malay>ketuk-ketuk</malay> [siol]
just anime like
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] anime
#weeaboo# <malay>kalau melayu apa</malay> #weeaboo#
<malay>kalau</malay> indo #weeaboo#
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching (um)
<malay>apa</malay>
(err) Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
(err)
part <malay>dia pun belum sampai dalam</malay> anime <malay>dia</malay>
(err) there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
they had they had to stop for a while <malay>pasal</malay> COVID
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
(uh) apparently january next year in japan [lah] <malay>tapi kat</malay> singapore <malay>belum tahu</malay> [ah]
maybe add three or four months
[ah] ya
in japan
[oh]
but (mm)
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file [ah]
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own <malay>macam</malay>
cinema <malay>punya</malay> based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
cloud
[oh] ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one [ah]
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
artefacts
(err) to do with the film [ah] let's say <malay>macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit</malay> then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself <malay>abeh nanti macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya tu</malay>
but but then again
ya ya that's the thing <malay>macam kalau</malay> film it's like
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel <malay>punya</malay> density
like with digital all like you are constrained by <malay>dia punya</malay>
the pixels [ah] and the resolution that it was framed at [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know lord of the rings
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
is because <malay>dia punya</malay> digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands (uh) two thousand one to two thousand and four
<malay>ada apa</malay>
<malay>dah ada apa</malay>
<malay>takde</malay> [ah] but it weren't limited like if you if you film
the actual film
like
(err) like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
but all the and the extra extra <malay>punya barang-barang</malay>
was (err) ten eighty P <malay>punya</malay> rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya</malay> effects
or whether <malay>dorang nak apa</malay>
(err) just use the existing <malay>punya</malay> rendering
and then upscale to four K <malay>tapi macam buruk</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> zoom zoom in <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] that's the kind of effect
[ah] ya ya ya <malay>macam</malay> stretched <malay>gitu</malay>
or like something someone would draw in paint
<malay>tak kasi dia makan dulu</malay>
<malay>tunggu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the [kan] the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
(err)
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
!huh!
I mean you have an eye for the frame [what]
[ah] ya [lah] you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script <malay>macam mana dia punya</malay> scene develops
and then after that you will get like
you know like the three quarter removed <malay>punya</malay> angle or like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things (uh) like
<malay>macam</malay> the #kubrick# <malay>punya</malay>
stanley #kubrick# <malay>punya</malay> follow through the halls
behind ya that kind of shot [ah]
(mm)
A U T E U R [eh]
[a'ah]
#auteur#
ya
but
no <malay>tak nak tak nak</malay>
(err) anything [ah] can also (uh)
<malay>tapi macam kenyang</malay> [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] Gong Cha
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
how to work the camera to achieve that <malay>itu</malay>
flexible
in what sense
(mm)
okay ya
(mm)
[oh] to get [ah] ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
I think director director <malay>macam gitu</malay> is
<malay>dorang dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> successful <malay>dah ada banyak duit</malay> then
the ego that comes with it is <malay>itu</malay> (uh)
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and (err) location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
I think it can go anywhere [ah] doesn't necessarily have to be <malay>macam</malay>
horror or <malay>itu</malay> it can be like it can be like drama
but with
a
psychological (uh) age not twist [ah] like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about [ah]
that looking into the
the person and the nature of the person <malay>macam</malay> who are you <malay>gitu</malay>
(err)
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay [ah] stimulating [ah] but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like (um)
like you know Annihilation
ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
<malay>macam</malay> telling you
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and (err)
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
(err) three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
the the thing that I like about the original <malay>punya</malay> jurassic park is
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
that that (err) that <malay>apa</malay>
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
it kind of moves beyond <malay>macam</malay> like what what constitutes
through
(err) power
you know and like
a display of real fear
like how you know there was a scene of the guy <malay>yang dia dia</malay>
(err) <malay>apa ada</malay> T-rex
then after that <malay>dia</malay> abandoned <malay>budak-budak</malay> then after that <malay>dia terus dia lari masuk</malay> toilet then T-rex <malay>gigit kepala dia</malay>
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
(err)
let's see
[ah] the wailing
the wailing
it's like
it's like (err) <malay>macam</malay>
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
(mm)
I think I think they
go to the house
ya
<malay>apa dia</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya ya [a'ah]
(mm)
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail [ah]
I only remember the beautiful shots of the <malay>itu</malay>
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also <malay>macam lawa gitu</malay>
it's very <malay>macam</malay> ethereal
<malay>mana satu</malay>
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
[oh] ya that's okay okay we watched that [one]
we watched that [one] in the cinema (uh)
I cannot remember but it was the director of <malay>pengabdi setan</malay>
but I I want to watch <malay>pengabdi setan</malay> [ah] where to watch [ah]
<malay>malam ni</malay>
nevermind [ah]
I think that [one] will I probably will have to watch with #rehan# lights off speakers on
[oh]
(mm)
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it [ah]
because I I took the scriptwriting <malay>punya</malay> course <malay>apa</malay>
[eh] I got A you know don't play play you know
you make the film I write the script <malay>dah</malay> settle [ah]
director of photography [ah]
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
[ah]
no you know no
no [lah] we do it we do it properly [lah] but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from (err) getting
(uh) machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
[oh] ya
no need [ah] low budget [ah] indie
live what
no [lah] it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no [lah]
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free [lah]
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
[oh] ya correct correct
okay [lah] then when we on our off day then we do [ah]
I think can can no worry can be done
[oh] ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive
not anytime soon [lah]
like next year
like next year because <malay>tu apa tu</malay>
(uh) my hot [ah]
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
like my monitor <malay>punya</malay> resolution <malay>terlalu tinggi</malay> for the for the card
so <malay>macam</malay> I need a stronger card
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or [what]
[ah] whatever game you can try you try [ah]
(mm) you never try Borderland three
buy [ah]
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm <malay>murah punya</malay> maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know #rehan# that time buy on sale thirty seven <malay>murah</malay>
for the for the release price [lah] the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday [eh]
what you buy
[oh] ya
[oh] ya later [ah] later
masks
yes
<malay>dah sampai</malay>
compress
<malay>semprot</malay>
okay [lah]
[oh] okay
!huh!
I want to I want to take one
#nezuko#
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation [ah]
ya [lah] so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the #weeaboos# it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
that's why it's so <malay>macam itu</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> I don't like it [ah] because all the <malay>mat reps semua macam tengok macam</malay> (uh) demon slayer demon slayer
then I'm like bro you don't know what the #weeaboos# go through
I think
(mm)
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic [ah] in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
[oh] no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
(mm)
(uh) #haikyu# is not that
(mm)
<malay>tu semua</malay>
<malay>boleh beli dari</malay> AliExpress [pe]
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
#oregairu#
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
of the thing because it's actually <malay>dia macam</malay>
grounded in realism
<malay>macam</malay> with real respect for people <malay>punya</malay> feelings and not just some
random rom com <malay>yang dorang macam sebarang</malay> #rojak# <malay>letak kat dalam ni semua abeh</malay> mix mix mix <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>janji kelakar habis</malay> [ah]
ya like it was well thought out and well written [ah]
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season [ah]
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
(mm)
but at the same time like you must also consider <malay>macam kat</malay> japan [kan]
how it works is usually
<malay>yang</malay> the source material <malay>dorang punya</malay> #manga# <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> light novel <malay>ke</malay> visual novel <malay>ke</malay> [pe]
has to be actually very popular <malay>dalam</malay> its own format
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
or <malay>sampah habis</malay>
ya
so that's basically how it works (uh)
(mm)
different <malay>ke</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
[oh]
so <malay>sahaja</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>dia ambil</malay>
(mm)
(hmm)
(mm)
J drama

I think right the best <malay>kalau ada duit beli</malay> online <malay>sudah</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>betul memang memang</malay> my mum also experience that before <malay>dia beli apa</malay> [lah] <malay>kelakar</malay> it's not just <malay>baju</malay> [eh] it's like <malay>barang-barang rumah sekali</malay> after that <malay>dia punya</malay> colour <malay>lain</malay> and then <malay>dia punya</malay> size <malay>pun lain</malay>
<malay>ada boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> all those order <malay>macam</malay> order from china all that how to how to return back [seh]

and then <malay>sekali datang</malay> like that time okay it's funny that time [eh] I'm sure you <malay>mesti</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> story <malay>pasal</malay> like failed grab delivery <malay>punya apa tu</malay>
(err)
<malay>punya</malay> orders my god my my time <malay>bila</malay> I mean my experience so far is like [oh] my god
like it's really crazy like okay example [leh] that time I <malay>beli ayam penyet</malay> and then you know what happen <malay>nasi tak datang boleh gitu</malay> order <malay>ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi nasi</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> and then <malay>bila bila</malay> complain <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> firstly <malay>dia orang tak angkat</malay> phone <malay>abeh dah dah gitu</malay> and then <malay>nak tanya</malay> [lah]
<malay>mana mana nasi</malay> [kan] <malay>nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang</malay> order <malay>nasi lemak tak ada nasi</malay> order <malay>nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar</malay>
and then <malay>dah lapar</malay> and then after that <malay>dia orang boleh cakap</malay> [oh] I think the <malay>nasi dia orang</malay> either <malay>dia orang lupa atau</malay> driver <malay>makan</malay> !huh! <malay>tak</malay> I don't know <malay>nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa</malay>
you imagine if it's you <malay>kalau</malay> if it's your if you are in my shoes <malay>tak marah</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> <malay>nak tunggukan nasi</malay> and then <malay>takkan</malay> so the the <malay>kelakar</malay> part is the <malay>kelakar</malay> part of the story is what know
<malay>bila</malay> I call them to go and say that <malay>the nasi tak ada</malay> and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
and then they they said (err) depends [ah] ma'am depends I said !huh!
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say [ah] <malay>tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke</malay> and then
<malay>kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia cakap</malay> ma'am because right the restaurant (err) a lot of order [ah] ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait [ah] maybe one or two hours <malay>untuk satu nasi</malay> I'm like [ah]
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] in the end my mum <malay>masak nasi sendiri</malay> [ah] so thanks [lah] so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
<malay>satu jam</malay> [eh] [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>mesti dah</malay>
<malay>dah membara</malay> you know like <malay>dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> still <malay>nak tunggu satu jam</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli</malay> mcdonald's <malay>sudah</malay>
circuit breaker ya [orh]
ya [lah] <malay>masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak</malay> clean up <malay>tu nak bersihkan</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
[ah] !wah! <malay>mesti</malay> crowded <malay>gila</malay> [ah]
<malay>abeh</malay> !huh! cancel
<malay>abeh</malay>
(mm) on that day itself [ah] [orh] okay okay
[eh] [eh] <malay>jahatnya sedih</malay>
(mm) (mm)
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing [seh] it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job [lah] basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like (uh) mcdonald's then okay ya (err) like customer number one two three four and then they just say [ah] ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
(mm)
so I think also <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the restaurant <malay>nak</malay> blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end <malay>siapa yang</malay> suffer [seh]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dia punya gaji bukannya berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kesian</malay> (mm) (mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] I mean I <malay>selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan</malay> motor [lah] <malay>dengan kereta</malay> [lah] and then
<malay>selalu macam</malay> you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so <malay>macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam susah</malay> you know <malay>macam kesian</malay> [ah] <malay>macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya</malay>
<malay>apa tu dia orang punya</malay> job [lah] like <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer [lah]
(mm)
[eh] [eh] <malay>baiknya</malay> [lah] [eh] [eh] <malay>siapa</malay> [seh] <malay>tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu</malay> as in tip in cash or !huh! [oh] my god
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua</malay> still <malay>ada</malay> comment [lah] singaporeans standard [lah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>bukan</malay> singaporean <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay> order <malay>macam</malay> like that time <malay>baru</malay> my friend order <malay>apa</malay> [eh] I think <malay>dia</malay> order
<malay>susah kalau</malay> I mean that time my friend <malay>pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang</malay> [eh] that time my friend order during <malay>bulan puasa</malay> [ah] during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk [lah] because <malay>dia orang ada macam</malay>
<malay>apa macam</malay> (err) open house [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> open house <malay>macam</malay>
(err) family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be [lah] you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is <malay>dia hantar banyak rumah</malay> so they order <malay>macam</malay> maybe like four packet like <malay>empat</malay> packet <malay>satu rumah</malay>
so altogether maybe about <malay>empat puluh</malay> packet they just put you know [lah]
malay family <malay>banyak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia baik hati</malay> [lah] because like one of the days <malay>dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan</malay> so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the <malay>makanan basi</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi</malay> and then <malay>macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan</malay>
so <malay>dia punya</malay> order <malay>datang pukul empat</malay>
and then <malay>dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas</malay> and then after that <malay>makanan dia basi</malay> so <malay>satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih</malay>
[ah] <malay>abeh yang kelakar punya yang</malay> the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that (err) food stall <malay>dia boleh cakap apa</malay> [tau] [oh] (err) sorry [ah] to customer who got the food that is <malay>basi</malay>
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business !huh!
<malay>tak</malay>
[ah] [ah] so also <malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] because okay [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you <malay>macam</malay> a bit of refund or what [lah] but because they are
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like !huh!
correct and then <malay>nasi</malay> I mean okay <malay>nasi padang</malay> [eh] maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month [eh] plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus [tau] then imagine half of the <malay>nasi basi macam mana gitu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tak ada tak ada tak ada</malay> refund <malay>tak ada dia boleh cakap</malay> [oh] we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kesian</malay> and then it's like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pergi mana</malay> cycling <malay>kat mana</malay> [seh]
<malay>boleh juga</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tapi esok</malay> sunday [seh] confirm <malay>banyak orang</malay>
[oh] <malay>masih</malay>
[ah] [ah] <malay>sama</malay> mountain bike [ah] <malay>sama tak tak tak tukar</malay>
[oh] my god really

[kan] unless it's <malay>sama apa kalau nasi lemak</malay> I mean okay [lah] the good thing is that <malay>dia punya</malay> price there is like <malay>macam dua</malay> I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya

[ah] [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] it's like and then <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] because nowadays <malay>bila panas</malay> very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time <malay>dekat dekat</malay> singapore I think <malay>kat mana entah</malay> #changi# <malay>ke</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>ke</malay> #bedok# the rain <malay>sampai</malay> flooding <malay>sampai banjir</malay> and then the <malay>banjir</malay> is so bad that
at the bus stop <malay>dia punya orang</malay> is standing on the seat [eh]

<malay>macam bukan kat</malay> singapore [seh]
!huh!

or phase one or something then the <malay>dia punya</malay> it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus [leh] and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers <malay>habis</malay> [lah]
<malay>basah kuyup</malay> [seh] <malay>habis</malay> [ah]
<malay>kesian</malay> (uh) (uh) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] that's why it's like really not like singapore [seh]
(mm) (mm)
and then means weather forecast <malay>semua salah</malay> [lah]
thanks [eh]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain <malay>dia cakap</malay> actually suppose <malay>hujan sampai</malay> tuesday [ah] next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today <malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>panas mana tak</malay> dengue <malay>kat</malay> singapore
[ah] maybe [lah] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
weird [leh] no but talking about dengue [oh] my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day <malay>pasal</malay> the dengue case and then one of my colleague <malay>boleh kena</malay> dengue [seh] (uh) (uh) and the <malay>kelakar</malay> part <malay>dia mat salleh</malay>
so #ang moh# [lah] you know and then
<malay>dia dia asyik</malay> I think <malay>dia asyik keluar petang</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> jogging <malay>ke apa entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap</malay> [oh] I I was out sick for one week so I said [lah] how are you so I thought maybe (um) like he fever <malay>ke</malay> cause you know [lah] nowadays <malay>kalau sakit</malay> it's like either you <malay>kena</malay> COVID nineteen or you <malay>kena</malay>
dengue and then the funny part is <malay>dia cakap dia kena</malay> dengue
(uh) (uh) confirm and then <malay>dia dah takut</malay> because they <malay>dia ingatkan</malay> that <malay>kena masuk</malay> hospital [lah] so actually <malay>tak payah</malay> because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
ya but it's quite serious [lah] because I don't know
I I I don't know how he got it I think <malay>dia cakap</malay> that maybe because <malay>dia selalu keluar petang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia keluar petang</malay> to go jogging around <malay>dia punya</malay> area and <malay>dia</malay> standard [lah] <malay>dia tinggal dia tinggal kat</malay> robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area [ah] then after that
(err) don't know how he <malay>balik</malay> and then <malay>dia macam dia pening</malay> [lah] <malay>abeh dia batuk-batuk</malay> [lah] and then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia rasa macam</malay> something is wrong [lah] so <malay>dia cakap</malay> actually <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor first time then doctor say [oh] maybe you're just tired because <malay>dia sekarang</malay> [kan] everybody work from home [ah] then after that <malay>dia ingatkan</malay>
okay [lah] maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end <malay>dia pergi</malay> to another doctor the doctor <malay>cakap</malay> dengue then <malay>dia dah</malay> panic [lah]
so <malay>dia macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana ni macam mana</malay> [seh] so <malay>dia dia takut</malay> that <malay>dia kena</malay> hospitalize [lah] because <malay>kalau</malay> hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
[ah]
p[a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] and then nowadays you know [lah] <malay>kalau ambil</malay> is not like those days [lah] [ah] like <malay>dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi</malay> I mean <malay>ambil</malay> <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] one two days stay at home <malay>sekarang</malay> is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss <malay>semua tahu habis</malay> [seh]
(mm) [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
is it <malay>tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak</malay>
[orh]
<malay>abeh macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>dia orang nak</malay> check <malay>macam</malay> I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay [lah] I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like (err) <malay>kat apa tu</malay> at the west side I think #yishun# or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day <malay>ada</malay> fogging [ah]
and then fogging you know [lah] the smell [oh] my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in #yishun# and woodlands they say every other day <malay>ada</malay> fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell <malay>macam nak muntah</malay> [seh] and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
[oh]
(mm) (mm) okay okay
(mm) [orh]
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
my mum even funnier <malay>bila dia dengar pasal</malay> these dengue cases and then like because that day I read it was ten thousand so then when I was talking to my #ang moh# colleague the the guy then his then (err) he said he doesn't know [lah] that because they #ang moh# <malay>apa</malay> he from sweden [ah] <malay>dia tak dia tak dia tak baca</malay> local news <malay>sangat</malay> [lah] <malay>baca pasal</malay> COVID nineteen COVID nineteen
and the pandemic and everything that's happening in the world [lah] then but then he never read about the dengue then he said [oh] I didn't know that dengue was a very big thing so I said ya it's actually ten thousand cases <malay>sekali</malay> I read on the day itself is already more than twenty two thousand cases [eh] it's crazy my god
[oh] my god crazy and it's scary because you really don't know how you can get it
(mm) aedes correct ya
(mm)
<malay>tapi macam mana</malay> [seh]
<malay>macam mana nak tengok kalau</malay> even if your eyesight is like perfect eyesight <malay>macam mana nak tengok</malay>
by the time they want to <malay>gigit</malay> you they just <malay>gigit</malay>
most likely it is [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
so <malay>leceh</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang kalau kalau sakit</malay> then <malay>susah</malay> [tau] <malay>nak kena pergi</malay> doctor [lah] <malay>nak kena</malay> self self isolate [lah] then <malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam-macam</malay> test [seh] <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena ambil</malay> is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know [lah] is hard to predict right ya so <malay>kalau dah</malay>
I don't know [lah] just keep healthy [lah] [ah] just keep on exercising <malay>makan betul-betul jangan makan</malay> all the
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat [lah] once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
he just drink water a lot everyday because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary [ah]
(mm) correct correct
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] nowadays
every other day sure got some story [one]
in the news both (mm) (mm) local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting [sia] I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like [oh] my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day <malay>mesti ada</malay> something you know and it's only what august [oh] my god
crazy (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
!huh! [oh] my god
so scary
[oh] my god
ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>betul susah</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm) fifty five
ya [lor] that's why how [seh] they check everyday like that <malay>tak penat ke macam</malay>
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya [lah] that's true [lah] (mm) (mm) it's a bit more controlled [lah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see [lah] the weather like <malay>panas</malay> [lah] <malay>hujan</malay> [lah] then all the <malay>air bertakung</malay> like that then <malay>mana tak</malay> dengue [seh] ya then there's nobody like
because my house area <malay>ada banyak</malay> new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks <malay>macam seram</malay> [seh] like so quiet (mm) so I guess [lah] because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
more and more ya (mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> [lah] correct
[ah] [ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kesian</malay> [eh]
natural garden [ah]
ya definitely definitely
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>makan</malay> maggi [jer] [lah] <malay>hari-hari</malay> they are also heroes [ah] (mm) (mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like (err) quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that [oh] my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know [lah] I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like
is all that is not important [seh]
(mm) (mm)

you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
(mm) (mm)
<malay>kelakar</malay> right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees [eh] completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal [lah] you know what I mean
<malay>kalau tidak susah macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>macam</malay> like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
something that I don't know like
every every singaporean loves you know (mm) (mm) like that day <malay>apa tu baru</malay> national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend

virtual workout virtual makeup I think that day I <malay>baru nampak</malay> virtual makeup session then like
but everything [lah] everything is now virtual [lah] like but it's quite actually interesting [lah] like virtual seminar webinar so quite I mean
like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day <malay>baru</malay> I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
ya that's true (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul betul</malay> [lah] netflix [eh] netflix <malay>hari-hari</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> the amount of things on netflix you can watch is
endless [seh] like non stop like I've been watching so many movies on netflix and it's like endless like non stop like
recently it was funny because they uploaded all the local singapore movies and also

like you say [lah] they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
I think <malay>dah buka</malay> [lah] but like I mean you have to take precaution right
!wah!
funny ya
ya [lah] sometimes no choice is the best choice [lah] [ha]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) physical is no longer really needed [lah] [ha]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say [lah] just go out for awhile then <malay>balik cepat-cepat</malay> you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
normal I guess you know
(mm) (mm) ya
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks [seh] [oh] my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that [oh] the fireworks you have to do at #padang# because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year [oh] my god so many different places <malay>kat</malay> #tampines# <malay>ada kat</malay> #jurong# I think is it
[ah] !wow! amazing (mm) (mm)
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya [lah] (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) cancelled [kan] [oh] postpone [ah] okay okay
once every four years right (mm) (mm) millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the <malay>duit</malay>
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know [lah] I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
[oh] ya I think I saw that
(mm) (mm)
nature is healing [ah] mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) ya ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah]
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) less is more
(mm) (mm)
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving [what] you know
(mm) (mm)
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it [lah] you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell [lah] [oh] okay (mm) (mm) hobby [eh]
<malay>boleh nyanyi</malay> (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya that's true
ya [lah] must be positive [lah] because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you <malay>rasa</malay> like <malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa marah</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa sedih</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa ni</malay> [lah] <malay>macam-macam</malay>
<malay>macam-macam perasaan tapi</malay> at the end of the day <malay>mesti</malay> positive [lah] you know <malay>kalau tak</malay> positive <malay>susah</malay> [seh] I mean <malay>hari-hari takkan</malay> I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive [lah] of course some days <malay>kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke</malay> just feel all your emotions and then
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done [lah] of course but can be done it can be done ya
<malay>tak penat ke</malay> [eh] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay> no [lah] and also you complain
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> (mm) (mm)
true
standard [ah]
[ah] <malay>ni kalau ni</malay> singaporean <malay>kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>bukan</malay> singaporean [kan]
(mm) (mm)
I mean it's complaining is part of life [lah] you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
(mm) (mm) true very true
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> I mean there's good and bad [lah] I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know <malay>macam</malay>
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely [kan] (uh) (uh)
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask [lah] right I mean ya I mean singapore <malay>nak semua orang kena pakai</malay> mask
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see [eh]
<malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask
so like <malay>macam suka-suka</malay> [jer] then I like
[eh] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory [lah] for all but then I guess
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like (mm)
<malay>jaga diri baik-baik</malay> [lah] you know <malay>kalau pakai nak pakai</malay> up to you [lah] you know
(mm) (mm)
<malay>semua nak jadi</malay> famous [ah] <malay>semua tak ada kerja nak jadi</malay> famous [ah] so okay [lah] so <malay>dia orang tak nak pakai</malay> mask then like I guess
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>bukannya mahal ke</malay> the mask <malay>ada</malay> I think what less than one dollar you can get already
(uh) <malay>tu</malay> [lah]

okay so (err) <malay>tadi</malay> [kan] <malay>kita cakap pasal</malay> three wish <malay>tadi kita cakap pasal</malay> the three wishes [kan] for the year so you said that you already have one of the wishes fulfilled what's the other two that you think we should try to accomplish as a family or like individual
I guess that's a need [lah] not a wish
your youtube <malay>punya</malay> channel do you have a target like for the number of followers
but the thing is when I watch your when I watched that video that you uploaded [kan] it's like a it's a live stream but the thing is sometimes all I want to know is if I'm not playing that game I wouldn't know like what you are trying to do [kan]
because <malay>macam</malay> I thought like your the intention of the game right was to show highlights [lah] but if you don't have those kind <malay>macam</malay> those text <malay>yang dekat tepi tu</malay> say like to narrate whatever that the screen is doing because most of the people who watch the video <malay>dia orang tak</malay> on the audio [what] <malay>kau kalau macam</malay> the person switch off the audio and you just you playing <malay>macam tak ada</malay> some (err) text visuals to compliment you <malay>punya</malay> video so I thought like I don't know maybe it could be your first draft [jer]
[oh] okay I <malay>faham</malay> so that means <malay>dia punya</malay> the video that you are trying to achieve or your channel [kan] it's like <malay>macam</malay> highlights for that particular night <malay>punya</malay> game like what other wins and what are the near wins what are the losses [lah] that kind of that's that's the kind of like video channel that you trying to achieve [lah]
because right how I can relate is like you know those there's this kind of channel or video and (err) where you watch people eat
so I I I'm just thinking right is like it gives me that kind of <malay>macam</malay> those (err) it gives me that kind of impression <malay>macam</malay> when I watch people play game [kan] it's like it's as though like they are narrating something or like or what are they trying to achieve through this video <malay>macam</malay> it's just it's similar just like the <malay>makan punya</malay> channel or <malay>makan punya</malay> video it's like okay here's what I ordered for lunch today okay let's see whether it's
going to be delicious (mm) ya is very nice ya I like the prawn is a bit juicy you know but it's not something that your audience <malay>boleh</malay> visualise or taste or what you know so I I you is it something like that that kind of (err) are you targeting that kind of audience where people just watch it just for the sake of watching it but there's no there's really no purpose you just like to share that like
because I think I watch the live stream not the edited [one]
just you just now you say about the spiders suit right I was thinking
I don't know just now (err)
we were talking about a one one wish that you said that you already achieve right the five which you already got through the (um) your #spidey# spider suit right then then the one that someone was wearing is <malay>apa tu</malay> the spiderman the puffy one that's the one that your brother give
so I'm thinking if we could get a family one but I am obviously cannot wear it outside because it's <malay>haram</malay> because it's very very very <malay>ketat</malay> unless I wear it for swimming
because properly they cover all my <malay>aurat</malay> so I I mean <malay>macam</malay> if you see that is a good investment for us to like all the school shoes it's kind of different kind of combination then we can right
then ya we just take the measurement [ah] <malay>tapi yang</malay> the one you <malay>beli tu berapa</malay> [ah]
for your suit [jer]
include ship
how long you need to wait for
I don't know whether you want to get for the kids cause they will grow very fast
he can wear the puffy [one] [ah]
how about the brother
what about the mum mother what we have a tripod for what
K [lah] faster [lah] you order for me and then you order for #safi# also [lah]
I want to wear the gwen okay that's the only character that I can wear right
spiderman series [lah] [kan]
black cat <malay>apa</malay> cat woman what the shouldn't he just be a cat woman but it's leather [kan] cat woman <malay>punya</malay>
cat woman <malay>punya</malay> okay [ah] <malay>ada</malay> cat woman <malay>punya</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> [ah]
then I just pass it off as spider cat [ah]
the one that you say [oh] black cat right spider cat is the we just created a new character
just created a new character no I think he followed me ya he followed the style of conversation no but you ate cheese fries already yesterday [oh] ya I'm supposed to cook the soup first
ya for dinner then at least tomorrow you can eat it for lunch [lah]
[oh] ya you <malay>dah telefon</malay> your mother to come tomorrow
the thing is I don't know whether I [ah] actually I want to take half day I got
no I wait the following week is not christmas right
[ah] I will take next week actually
because I got one more half day I never take wait let me think
[oh] gosh I don't know because next tuesday I already on leave [kan] maybe I just take this friday [lor] next tuesday is for its for appointment [what]
no !wah! you <malay>tahu</malay> my colleague geraldine she encash fourteen days [eh] [oh] my god I was like
!wah! I don't get it [seh] how did you even accumulate fourteen days [eh] [oh] ya because she she doesn't need to take leave like me right
how did everyone accumulate two digit <malay>punya</malay> leave balance [seh]
!wow! what a plan
I wish I could say that
ya that's the thing because you your contract already said you need to clear you need to give it two months notice that's why you you have that mind mindset that you need to save them
[oh]
ya no but for me is I think the work from home thing save me a bit because at least I can manage my time <malay>kalau tak</malay> already I tell you by august <malay>begitu</malay> [kan] I would already have exhausted all my leave already for #safwan# appointment the children vaccination and then you know remember #saffi# hospitalise
during his first year birthday [eh] wait but that is last year but then how come this year my leave exhausted I think it's because the the sick or when they are sick I keep taking leave at the start of the year
ya I guess that's the only one [ah] [oh] ya <malay>tadi kita cakap pasal</malay> what can you mentioned the IKEA <malay>punya</malay> cannot cannot fit are you sure like all the cabinets cannot fit
then can we buy like two so one is on the left one is on the right
so the alternative is either we change the sink or we build a
serious I thought he called somebody
father in law
were we even there I was not there
what a shitty experience
was the <EX1>bangla< paid
!aiyo! I'm just thinking
whether right we should just (err) (err) fix the cabinet <malay>dekat</malay> (err) the master bedroom side because (um) for this mean toilet I <malay>nak ada</malay> other some improvements in (err) in terms like <malay>macam</malay> there's that rail handrail so that down the road [kan] <malay>kita tak payah nak</malay> renovate
ya because adding the <malay>macam</malay> cabinet there [kan] it might like <malay>macam</malay> block <malay>orang punya</malay> as in it might block [lah] whoever who
okay [lah] no no I'm not even thinking of renovating the toilet
wait the toilet renovations two toilet renovation ten K or just the <malay>jamban</malay>
then the is the end product nice
then [oh] right that was not your right the one that (err) <malay>rumah dia</malay> is actually just opposite B P there right the resale [kan] actually no wonder they need to (err) hack the toilet because she (um) megan got tell me before the <malay>dia punya rumah tu macam</malay> quite rundown and then if they don't fix it [kan] <malay>macam</malay> is cannot as in there will be leak and everything [lah]
!huh! <malay>ya ke</malay> that means they just enter the house don't need to do anything
[oh] then who was the one who told me that they need to fix the piping and everything <malay>ya ke</malay> #izzad# <malay>punya rumah dekat mana</malay>
no I mean like #dan# house
[oh] they take over they are not (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> getting a new house [ah] because I know the <malay>dia orang punya</malay> cousin #wardah# and #umar# [kan] nearby [kan] that's why they don't intend to shift [ah]
so <malay>bila</malay> #ija# <malay>bersalin</malay>
[oh] man <malay>tapi</malay> they they always give a one week one week
<malay>tak baik</malay> [seh] <malay>cakap macam tu</malay>
I think I think <malay>dia pun</malay> worried [seh]
[eh] <malay>tapi dah tahu lelaki atau perempuan</malay>
[orh] what <malay>tanya</malay> [jer] [ah] what the heck
you can just ask [what]
like that
I don't know actually right if I were to go through one more time [ah] the pregnancy [ah] I really want to have that element of surprise [lah] it's okay I'm just gonna push him up or push her out and then know the gender but it's hard because I need to prepare and I'm not someone who will <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay> like not prepare
!huh!
no I mean especially if it's if no surprise to see talking about surprise that's the thing sometimes right it works (err) in your favour sometimes
it cannot that and then I know for me [kan] I can't although it's a good surprise right if it doesn't <malay>macam</malay> if I'm not wrong planning need or what right <malay>macam</malay> it won't impact me for example like is my kid so I know that I need to make preparation for it [what] cause like my kid <malay>keluar</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> make sure [oh] <malay>dia punya</malay> the bottle is blue for example and it's not in pink you know that kind so to me I mean we can buy neutral colours [lah] it's just that I don't know [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] very not that the bottles that I bought have to be blue is in green [kan] actually the bottle <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>belikan tu</malay> all green [kan] because [ah] #safwan# <malay>punya</malay> milk <malay>pun</malay> green <malay>dia punya</malay> apparel <malay>pun</malay> green <malay>ingat tak</malay> and then <malay>dia punya yang</malay> all the friends <malay>yang kita beli ni semua</malay>
colour <malay>hitam</malay> so it's like there's no gender coloured gender influence colour
ya but actually I kind of like the pink pink blue kind of combination <malay>macam</malay> those kind of paddle pop <malay>punya</malay> colour like you know very pastel kind is it pastel
<malay>yang dia</malay> rainbow [tau] <malay>yang</malay> paddle pop <malay>punya</malay> ice cream <malay>tu</malay> [tau]
actually I kind of actually I wanted the this room to be like that see like this blue [kan] [kan] it goes well with this kind of pink [kan] <malay>cantik</malay> [kan]
not hot pink [lah] like the like the lighter [one] like a bit more pale
the app no [lah] that [one] champagne gold [lah] ya ya ya correct correct correct [ah] like that
!wah! okay [lah] actually there are a lot of things that I want to improve for this house actually the very first thing right I want to do is actually [kan] I <malay>nak</malay> amend and fix the <malay>dapur punya</malay> counter top I really cannot stand the counter top [lah] ya <malay>macam</malay> so hard to clean it's like I think it's because of the the <malay>macam</malay> the gap
ya and then the thing is right the water the water doesn't dry out as fast as I want it to be I don't know whether is it because <malay>macam kita punya rumah</malay> is just so the window is just so closed up so that you you know you can't really like the wind <malay>tak masuk</malay> I did but the thing is when I wipe it [kan] there's still some a bit of moist
usually ya [lah] usually they will they have like some (uh) ventilation [lah] so that the <malay>tu</malay> so that the you know the surfaces would dry quickly
so that's the only thing [lah] I want to fix just the counter top I don't know whether is it as simple as just like knocking but do you know when you knock it out the <malay>apa tu pintu</malay> cabinet will <malay>pecah</malay> [kan] actually [oh] my god
ya that's the only cause the master bedroom you know I don't think I want to change anything maybe maybe just the part [ah] change to a bigger no the thing is right no no no let me just explain I want to use
projector you know that [one] no you know they have this technology where you bring like the kind of like tissue box style and then you can project the thing when you have it's not a torchlight it's a projector
like the the torchlight for the story book [eh]
gosh
so just now I was telling you I was talking about I was (err) my friend called [ah] from (uh) ya just like (uh) like so it was quite interesting because (uh) they needed a picture of a day doctor (err) then (err) the but suddenly you because the doctor is from our hospital <malay>tapi</malay> they need a doctor to be featured <malay>dia orang punya</malay> newsletter
but but the thing is the doctor submitted the picture that is not that they didn't meet their requirements of the but the printer [lah] so they needed us to take a picture then I was thinking like can't you just use the phone because the you know my Google Pixel <malay>ni</malay> I took I took a picture and (err) portrait <malay>punya macam</malay> mode [kan]
but when I when I send across [kan] it's at least three meg three four meg know that's why I don't get it <malay>macam</malay> why would you need like (um) a professional camera to take a photo when you can just take a photo with your phone and it is about three to four megabyte is it because like the newsletter is like <malay>dia</malay> require exactly three hundred because <malay>kita punya</malay> my mobile phone [kan] when I check (uh) is like hundred eighty
h
so no choice <malay>nak kena pakai</malay> [lah]
no but that's the highest I could go I couldn't and then what I need [kan]
no the the photo they want it to be the resolution when you port it to photoshop [kan] is in three hundred but my the the camera that the G seven X camera at my office the highest you can go is hundred and fifty or hundred and eighty the point and shoot
ya [lah] but we don't have so what I did to bypass it right is I shot I shot it in two <malay>apa tu</malay> two style [eh] two <malay>apa tu</malay> file format one is the raw one is the (uh) so <malay>kalau macam dia orang nak</malay> edit [kan] they just use the raw version apparently it works
that's what they that's what I did to bypass the <malay>macam</malay> the wall stickers I I don't know I don't know how to bypass it without having a so I just took into a in <malay>dua punya</malay> format then I send to the to the printer (err) not printer designer then I ask them to layout because it's a very big it's a big wall sticker you would say so you only I don't know whether you wanna if because our phone cannot take raw [kan] actually raw image it has to be set from a camera [kan]
camera our phone cannot set raw [kan] raw image file
what iphone can [ah]
are you planning to change your phone [oh] wait you change already [ah] I don't know whether I want to change a okay the thing is don't get me wrong I <malay>suka dengan</malay> my phone which is the model but I find it too big I just wanna pixel three I <malay>tak nak</malay> pixel but that time [kan] <malay>tak ada ingat tak</malay> I ordered online
four A is small [kan]
it's it's really huge [ah] serious I just find it too huge but <malay>macam</malay> when I hold it on my palm [kan] I will need to stretch I <malay>punya</malay> thumb onto the other side of the screen just to type it
so I I was thinking I was torn between these two options either I <malay>ambil</malay> I <malay>ambil</malay> the ring and <malay>tampal</malay> you know the ring where you can put your finger inside and then you hold it or either I put the link card <malay>punya</malay> holder <malay>tu</malay> so I was thinking which one is more practical but of course is the link holder

(mm) <malay>mana ada dah berhenti apa</malay> it's not [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
sorry [ah] I <malay>pakai</malay> contact lens please
<malay>kena</malay> [lah] it's just (um) the thing is that I have too many that I don't know which one to do first ya [lah] but usually
it's very everything is important you know when they say like [oh] everything is urgent
[oh] !aduh! the the the person <malay>yang</malay> email I <malay>ni dah apa tu</malay> ya <malay>yang tadi</malay> I <malay>berbual dengan dia tu dia dah</malay> email [eh] [oh] <malay>dia</malay> also <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>sama</malay> [ah] [a'ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] what we are small fry we are obviously right that's why [a'ah] [seh] <malay>kita semua dari tu</malay> [eh] get that experience
<malay>dah</malay> [lah] that's the thing is [lah] a meritocracy world I don't know [lah] I just find that sometimes it's really the thing is <malay>dekat</malay> my place <malay>ni</malay> [kan] I don't know why is like your capabilities <malay>tak cukup</malay> [tau] you <malay>punya</malay> papers is to <malay>macam</malay> is to support <malay>dia punya</malay> capabilities <malay>padahal</malay> it's like
you ask the person to go to the kitchen you don't need to ask for that [lah] of course [lah]basic is like have you <malay>pernah masak ke tak</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> doesn't mean <malay>tak pernah masak tak boleh masak benda sedap</malay> you know what I mean ya so I always give them this kind of theory so you <malay>suruh</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> something
but to compensate me to compensate me you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] (err) I know you do a good job <malay>tapi</malay> but sorry you not wearing (uh) (err) this (err) nike shoes so you cannot be promoted you know it's just like you are just trying to find a excuse basically that's what that's how I how I feel so whenever I put into perspective to this kind of people just ya ya but it's not <malay>kita tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> this kind of things are like beyond our hands [oh] the
maximum I can bring you is to the door but to open the door right you need this key and this key is a degree
then I will be like what then next time you ask me to do something I just say I could only do until this stage ya makes sense [kan] then <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>cakap macam tu</malay> will be like shit don't be too don't be too like (err) <malay>ini</malay> [lah]
then they will be like [oh] can [lah] #shah# you know I would right but I could could not I cannot ya [sia] really I always give this kind of then they will say #shan# stop trying to be clever I'm not trying to be clever if I'm clever I'm already your boss
then they just laugh
see [ah] can can I just share with you about my work like the the things that I being asked to do you <malay>tahu</malay> I <malay>kena buat</malay> about this digital plan about this (um) publicity booking schedule [tau] this publicity booking schedule is not as easy as you ask for one to six [eh] I <malay>kasi</malay> one to six I have ten people who can be asking for one to six
so who do I give it to so it's really based I <malay>punya</malay> like okay for example maybe person A <malay>ada</malay> event then person B <malay>dia bukan</malay> event <malay>dia punya</malay> it's just a reminder <malay>ke</malay> some patient safety reminder so I have to give priority to (uh) [ah] I have to give priority to the A person [kan] but then the thing is sometimes is not as straightforward as that because what if
(err) you have three people who want to put reminders and you <malay>tak ada</malay> event so how do you negotiate so so that's the thing [ah] is it the thing is I can do it but it requires (err) half a day I cannot do this kind of planning [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like as a <malay>macam sikit-sikit sini sikit-sikit sana</malay> I cannot I need to do <malay>macam</malay> I need to really focus I need to do the schedule I will do the schedule for half a day that's how I do so <malay>sekarang ni</malay> so I don't even want to start on it
because if I start on it I cannot do anything else and everything else is urgent so by the time I get this for this scheduling I cannot finish it ya and the deadline is tomorrow wait is today the deadline today is thursday right today is the deadline
for now time is ticking and I'm thinking what to eat later so I don't know so that's that's one of the stress that I I don't know how to work around this picture the other thing is
that admin person coming second jan [a'ah] !wah! because they are gonna serve notice one month at least so the thing is the funny thing about this person is <malay>itulah dia</malay> I don't know [eh] maybe (err) Q one end of Q one building up ya you <malay>dengar</malay> you <malay>dengar ni</malay>
I should [lah] actually
actually I like something it's very funny [tau] this person <malay>yang masuk ni dia</malay> contact so many people around me except me [tau] to ask me about the job to ask about the job [tau] <malay>macam</malay> like
you could you just ask me [what] <malay>padahal kita</malay> but then I always like no <malay>orang yang dia tanya semua melayu</malay> like is like <malay>kau boleh tanya aku apa</malay> like ya #shah# <malay>aku dengar ada</malay> opening I mean <malay>macam</malay> we met every year because I give out the greeting cards and the <malay>apa tu</malay> the calendar and then at some point of time you need like publicity you also contacted me <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>dia tanya orang yang dekat yang dah</malay> left [a'ah] <malay>macam dah</malay> transfer this [one] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> whether <malay>macam</malay> [a'ah] <malay>dia tanya</malay> #sinar# <malay>habis tu dia tanya</malay> #meha# except me
so I don't get it I mean like why would you ask somebody who who who left and <malay>orang yang tak kerja dekat</malay> department <malay>tu</malay> I don't get it [seh]
then I just like <malay>macam</malay> so I am a bit (err) I'm a bit like <malay>macam</malay> weary [tau] <malay>kalau macam</malay> why why she needs to <malay>tanya orang lain</malay> besides me because to me is I welcome internal transfer because I <malay>tak payah nak</malay> guide through <malay>macam</malay> that time ya because you can just ya because ya because you can just hit the ground running [eh] maybe they could have a better way
like bypassing certain things you know or work around certain things because the thing is although it's like a it's not a government a government sector [kan] <malay>dia ada</malay> we have more red ticks than the government you know and they very very <malay>macam</malay> very very rank conscious apparently you you <malay>macam</malay> like (err) of course I think sometimes what I want to tell my boss is that <malay>macam</malay> sometimes <malay>bukan</malay>
<malay>orang</malay> rank conscious [tau] is because like you <malay>tak boleh</malay> ask (err) a associate to be doing (err) <malay>punya kerja</malay> ya it's not a right [what] ans it is not because it's not it's nothing about do about your rank [tau] it's got to do with what you are paid to do you know so I I sometime I <malay>tak faham</malay> when people say like [oh] (err) you shouldn't be (err) you (um) saying that you just because you are associate you cannot do this
I mean is usually two sides to a coin [ah] you can see as like [oh] ya (uh) I shouldn't be (err) drawing lines about the work that I am doing but you also should look it at a perspective like if I keep doing this right then I'm being short changed and nobody likes to be short changed so for you to be saying this you are being selfish because at the end of the day you just want to get work done you don't care who but this person is is severely short changed so that that's the thing [lor] I I find that it's very hard to juggle <malay>kat</malay> at this this place I'm working at
<malay>dia macam tak dia tak</malay> (err) <malay>macam kalau kat yang kerja lama</malay> I <malay>ni dia</malay> very is very obvious [tau] <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>macam tadi</malay> my <malay>yang</malay> call I <malay>dia cakap dengan</malay> I (err) <malay>kat</malay> at least <malay>dekat kerja lama kita</malay> [kan] (err) we know okay this for this job <malay>cuma</malay> but the responsibility lies with the your degree holders the responsibility lies with them [tau] <malay>macam</malay> if thing goes wrong [kan] they are supposed to check
this and (um) they should be responsible (um) take responsibility for it and then now I heard they because they always change the person person [kan] [ah] <malay>baru punya orang</malay> and this person is from <malay>punya</malay> side [lah] so they are still learning the ropes to run that place [ah] side so apparently what I heard is they open more postings more openings for (err) diploma holders so <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] exactly so [kan] I <malay>bilang</malay> you there's [ah] (err) in that admission [kan] they have (um)
(err) the comms officer (err) assistant comms officer <malay>dengan</malay> #abassir# [kan] the one that I [kan] <malay>melayu</malay> they are very so now comms officer <malay>boleh pergi</malay> can take up the comms officer job
exactly and people are going to brunei you !wah!
I know [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> ya no no but the thing is the opportunity to go <malay>tapi dia tak pakai tu</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>tak pakai tudung</malay> ya so I mean it still applies [lah] I guess
I'm just thinking whether I should buy more of this (err) diffuser oil no wait I like it you don't like [ah] that's why you say <malay>macam</malay> the cockroach <malay>keluar malam-malam</malay> [kan] I mean <malay>dia orang mati</malay> [kan] I'm just thinking whether is it is it this smell that is causing them to be opening
unless it's like the baygon but the baygon cannot be is like <malay>dah lama</malay> [sia] I spray but if you notice this past few nights I <malay>tak</malay> spray [tau] maybe they just wanna commit suicide
I don't know no but (err) what I heard is you run over the tray [kan] you got you <malay>mati</malay>
no so what I did was I use the baygon I spray I spray a tray so the moment they pass this line [kan] they will die really you go and read about it is like you put them ya it's like baking soda so what they did was they put the baking soda <malay>punya</malay> powder [tau] then <malay>semua mati</malay>
crawl
really
<malay>bedak</malay> just normal <malay>bedak</malay> [ah] not <malay>bedak apa-apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> the the talcum powder [eh]
why don't we try that because the baygon the pesticide is really very

!wow!
I know how to self-defence like <malay>siapa-siapa nak pegang</malay> [kan] try me like seriously I learn a lot how to self-defence with guys [lah] cause <malay>dah banyak kali kita dah</malay> take advantage but then I learn how to be stronger [lah] <malay>belajar belajar belajar belajar</malay> #pang# <malay>satu kali ni</malay> this guy [ah] <malay>dia nak</malay> try one time shoot he run away he was like like
like legit no one talk to me anymore because he is the one <malay>yang nak ambil</malay> advantage <malay>punya</malay> he he tried to <malay>macam nak pegang-pegang tu semua</malay> then I was like bro we are just friends bro then you are touching me this way then he was like can [lah] can [lah] <malay>terus</malay> I give up like okay <malay>kau fikir perempuan ni apa lemah sangat apa</malay> I give him one punch at his face because I was
because I was like damn pissed off [lah] cause he really thinks I'm like girls is just like so weak you know like I hate it because
that [one] I don't care [lah] like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me <malay>ke buang</malay> (uh) me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done [lah] and <malay>dia pangkat</malay> sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant <malay>punya</malay> rank [lah] so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did <malay>buang</malay> so whatever he did to me he will get back [lah] ya
we are basically like the black people
no seriously like white always have the privilege I mean guys always have the privilege
(mm) that [one] is damn sad [lah]
I can't really say much but ya whatever it is like try me whatever happens happens [lah] because I know how to save myself but then we see how it goes [lah] who knows things change we don't know but like I can just be brave that's what I can do I just ya put my mind into him
like because like I feel like I'm talking to you like you know just don't make anything bad happen to me okay
I don't know the way that is not like (err) being like disrespectful disrespecting [lah] I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> cause he's the one that create us [what] so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with #allah# like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like <malay>bukan macam</malay> [eh] <malay>lu macam muak</malay> no
that's exactly ya that is like <malay>ya allah tolong</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>buat macam gini</malay> you know like please [lah] please [lah] at least that [one] he knows <malay>macam</malay> because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>berbual maki ya allah</malay> you know that
kind of disrespecting ya but then no [lah] so far I never do that before I'm like always like you know I'm always very comfortable
[oh] my god
I don't know what is their motive though we never disrespect your god why must you disrespect ours
I think because they watch a lot of nuns [lah] how is it scary we are [oh] my god we are covering up what we can cover man nevermind they don't understand we at least understand our religion nevermind as long as we believe in what our god trying to make us do nevermind they don't understand they don't need to understand [lah] they don't have to also
if not just ask us [lah] about you know try to understand about our religion at least like okay [lah] explain us about good I explained ask about your god
just because we look scary !wow!
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those <malay>hijab</malay> people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear <malay>hijab</malay> and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant #blah# #blah# #blah# no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like like that
like all those wannabes
same <malay>sama</malay> ya true true
(mmhmm) like not like not just saying that we are that old you know to the point where we can judge them like seriously this is you know
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect <malay>memang betul kita semua bukan</malay> perfect <malay>pun</malay>
so is like something is even <malay>orang yang</malay> very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes <malay>kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam</malay> [oh] !wow! <malay>kita aku rasa aku betul</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi orang lain tengok macam</malay> [eh] actually <malay>dia ni apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia buat</malay> [a'ah] [sia] <malay>salah</malay> [sia] <malay>padahal sendiri fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>baik baik baik</malay>
<malay>tapi nanti bila dah</malay> live a long life already <malay>fikir balik macam</malay> like [oh] my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that [lah] like so <malay>sekarang</malay> for the <malay>mak</malay> and <malay>minah</malay> I feel sorry for them [ah] because they maybe <malay>tak dia kurang ajar</malay>
<malay>pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar</malay> so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a <malay>minah</malay> and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a <malay>minah</malay>
I can be any anyone [lah] like can just say I'm a girl with a lot of personalities
I can be a <malay>minah</malay> I can be a #mat# I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and #allah# give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to <malay>macam</malay> you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes <malay>kita tak macam</malay> we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but <malay>padahal macam pada kita</malay> is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to <malay>macam</malay> sugarcoat everything <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you are doing so great [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai hijab tak tutup</malay> (err) <malay>apa apa ni leher takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>lupa melayu sikit takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tak tutup pun takpe</malay> [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>tak pakai tudung</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai tudung dengan</malay> sleeveless <malay>pun tak apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kau nak main bola pakai tudung</malay>
never heard of that but ya like <malay>semalam dah cakap</malay> [ah] it's like okay that kind of <malay>teguran</malay> is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like !wow!
[eh] example like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! #farah# so nice [ah] she everytime sugarcoat me ya but <malay>padahal</malay> #farah# itself is like
like I don't really mean that you know like I I'm just trying to sugar coat you because I want you to be my friend like that type you know so it's like people just don't know the difference
exactly (uh) like seriously I feel so <malay>malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri</malay>
(mmhmm) I mean they have like that self esteem okay fine that [one] I but then like that's too much [lah] know your limits [lah] no need to rub to our faces [lah] at least (mmhmm)
[eh] [oh] my god <malay>kalau tak jadi riak pun</malay> #allah# <malay>tak terima</malay> [sia] so #allah# <malay>sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat</malay> so the more you share to people <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tahu tak aku solat</malay> [sia] [eh] <malay>lima waktu</malay> [sia]
okay then what you want me to do <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you confirm go to heaven [lah] what you expect exactly so is like [oh] my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite <malay>quran</malay> [ah] a lot of time <malay>macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau <malay>dah</malay> khatam belum</malay> like <malay>aku dah khatam</malay> [sia]
I'm like okay you can at least say like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kalau</malay> if your friends like haven't <malay>khatam</malay> and you have already <malay>khatam</malay> like at least two times three times you can just <malay>ajar</malay> that person <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>aku tolong kau</malay> [lah] <malay>aku bimbing</malay> [ah] <malay>apa aku akan jadi</malay> your guide [lah]
guidance okay so <malay>kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam</malay> K [lah] <malay>aku jadi cikgu engkau</malay> [lah] <malay>aku dah khatam banyak kali</malay> like you don't have to say that <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah]
like for example I haven't <malay>khatam</malay> you already <malay>khatam</malay> then I'm like I really want to <malay>khatam</malay> because I want to be closer to god I want to really understand it I want to finish it I want tears of (um) like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then #farah# came up to me like example [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) do you need help like <malay>kau belum khatam</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab aku baru khatam</malay> so <malay>kau perlukan bantuan tak</malay> at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me I was like okay [ah] <malay>boleh tolong tak</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like [oh] my god like <malay>memalukan gila</malay> [lah] <malay>serius serius</malay> like <malay>tuduh ke</malay>
[oh] my yes yes yes

<malay>tak macam pelik</malay> [eh] <malay>buat benda macam gini</malay>
okay anyway
[ah]
you said that you <malay>nak berbual pasal</malay>
<malay>rumah baru</malay> [kan]
okay so <malay>rumah baru tu</malay> I was thinking
[ah] initially [kan] <malay>saya nak buat yang</malay>
colour <malay>kelabu tu</malay> [kan] <malay>yang</malay> colour grey
minimalistic
minimalist
(mm) minimalistic
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang saya pasal</malay> that time <malay>saya tengok</malay> Pinterest then <malay>lepastu</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>saya nampak dorang buat macam</malay> this deep green <malay>punya</malay> colour <malay>dia macam</malay>
royal green <malay>punya</malay> colour
<malay>ada dia macam</malay> deep very
<malay>dia macam</malay> not dark green [tau] <malay>dia macam</malay>
emerald green <malay>gitu</malay>
[a'ah]
okay you
okay you see this <malay>ni</malay> [kan] light [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> something like this
no this [one] this [one] <malay>yang hujung ni</malay>
[ah]
but it's not very dark [what] <malay>dia macam</malay> okay okay [jer]
so I thought that colour <malay>untuk kita punya apa tu</malay>
master bedroom
(mm)
<malay>kat mana</malay> hall
<malay>dalam bilik</malay> feature wall <malay>kat mana</malay> [seh]
[orh]
then
but then our <malay>apa</malay> (err) headboard for the bed [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> cover feature wall you cover half already [what]
on top then might as well you <malay>taruk</malay> frame
<malay>entah apa-apa</malay> painting [ah] <malay>yang cantik-cantik ke</malay> you go and buy <malay>kat</malay> Spotlight <malay>ke</malay>
ya <malay>habis siapa nak</malay> paint
who know how to paint
<malay>terkenal</malay>
(hmm)
frame
then
no [lah] <malay>tak jatuh punya</malay> [lah]
okay I <malay>ada</malay> this idea [tau] [one]
okay okay I won't say one room but one wall you know the hallway <malay>yang</malay> [ah] okay <malay>sekarang</malay> it's
right then <malay>lepastu ada macam</malay> this narrow pathway
that separates the living room and the and the bedrooms
[ah] that pathway [kan] <malay>ada</malay> one wall
[ah] that wall <malay>yang</malay> now is the study table <malay>punya</malay> corner <malay>yang taruk</malay> printer
remember [ah] I want to make that wall I want to
because <malay>sana</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> (um)
what's that
<malay>apa tu</malay>
they have the drawer
<malay>dia macam ada</malay> mini table
and then <malay>bawah dia</malay> is all drawers
remember <malay>makcik tu buat</malay>
I want to tear that down
so that it's a wall flat wall
okay from bottom from top to bottom is a flat wall
and then I want to fill up that wall with frames like small small A four-sized <malay>ataupun</malay> A five-sized frames
of anything [ah]
ya
yes yes correct it's like a frame wall
because it's a
it's a walkway [what]
so if if it's a walkway I <malay>tak nak</malay>
!huh!
no dining table is still <malay>kat ni</malay> [pe] (uh) entrance
(mm)
but I think
I think no need raised floor [lah]
<malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau] the
if you put raised floor <malay>dekat depan</malay> entrance
then does it really have a purpose
then
exactly <malay>orang dari orang dari luar boleh nampak</malay> and then the people sitting at the raised floor can't really see the
so then <malay>macam</malay>
quite isolated from the rest of the room [tau] to mingle
because the the house is big the hall is big
okay so <malay>kat sini</malay> is one area
[a'ah]
and then the [one] behind behind the entrance
is <malay>macam</malay> an area of its own
so if people sit there then you cannot mingle with the people there already
because it's across but then it's quite far
then <malay>macam</malay> you don't want to talk across like that
you understand or not
[a'ah]
[ah] [a'ah] [a'ah]
so might as well leave it as dining area [ah] because anyway it's nearer to the <malay>dapur</malay> [what] then once you <malay>masak-masak kat dapur</malay> then you just <malay>keluar</malay> [kan] then it's <malay>sebelah</malay> [jer]
[ah] but we make it minimalistic [ah]
<malay>tak payah nak</malay> bulky bulky <malay>punya</malay> dining table
[ah] because right now <malay>dia punya</malay> dining table bulky <malay>gila</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
<malay>buang</malay>
then I thought
I thought of having the minimalistic dining table like just a normal because the floor is marble [what]
so maybe matching [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
which bedroom the small [one]
(mm)
master (mm)
the second [one] is the second [one] smack you okay then
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>lepastu</malay>
can
can
okay wait wait wait wait wait the first bedroom
<malay>dia punya tingkap</malay> area is the triangle [one] [kan] <malay>yang ada bucu</malay> [kan]
[ah] can [ah] <malay>yang itu yang bucu nya</malay> area <malay>kita buat</malay> raised floor
so at least <malay>dorang ada</malay> seating area <malay>kat situ</malay> then you can put you can put books [lah] or whatever you can put your playstation <malay>kat sana</malay> if you want to play games
then you don't need to <malay>semak</malay> [kan] the living room
because you <malay>kalau</malay> [dah] <malay>main</malay> start <malay>main</malay> game <malay>cam</malay> playstation <malay>kat</malay>
then
you don't want to buy playstation [meh]
sure or not you don't want playstation
but workstation if <malay>kat</malay> triangular <malay>punya bucu</malay> I don't think it work because <malay>dia banyak pakai</malay> space
and <malay>dia punya</malay> space <malay>tak</malay> [ah]
you don't use the space to the maximum you know
because it's triangular
(mmhmm)
reading room
okay but how how you want to do how you want to do that
(mm)
okay
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
it's about knee length [lah]
the raised floor is about knee length
okay so you can easily <malay>duduk</malay> [lah]
okay
(mm)
okay
<malay>almari yang</malay> in-built <malay>tu</malay>
[ah]
(mmhmm)
[ah]
L
okay
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
laptop and all
(uh huh)
<malay>buai</malay>
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya <malay>cakap pasal</malay> swing
<malay>mak cakap</malay>
if we install a swing that mount <malay>daripada</malay> ceiling
over the years [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> ceiling <malay>tu macam</malay> crack [tau]
because of the weight of the
of the swing itself and
when you sit down you know
<malay>cam</malay> combine weight [lah]
<malay>nanti</malay> ceiling <malay>tu macam</malay> crack [tau]
[ah]
ya so that [one] need maintenance
(mmhmm)
[kan]
<malay>dalam</malay> house <malay>seram</malay> [hor]
<malay>seram</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>saya macam banyak</malay> imagination <malay>kalau</malay> swing <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>nanti macam ye</malay> [lah] <malay>awak kerja malam</malay>
then <malay>saya sorang sorang kat rumah</malay>
[a'ah]
still
I'm in the same house [what] difference does it make
does it make any difference
I'm still alone
(mm)
let's scrap the swing no swing
okay why not
we switch the swing for
maybe one or two exercise machine
which we we want to buy also [what] you want to buy weights I want to buy the cardio <malay>punya</malay> machine
you tell me you want to buy weights [what]
we will
no [seh] I <malay>malas nak pakai tudung</malay> jogging <malay>kat luar</malay>
(mm)
then you no weights [ah]
sure or not
(mm)
okay [lah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] swing <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>seram pula nanti malam-malam</malay> alone
then
you'll never know
I don't want I don't want I don't want I don't want
!ee! not helping
living room <malay>saya nak gi</malay> toilet <malay>dapur asyik nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>benda</malay> !alah! <malay>tu</malay>
(mm)
actually the I want to put on the wall I want to mount on the wall because <malay>dia</malay> save space and it looks neater
because okay last time people use console because they got speakers got player now don't have already [what] all you sync to your phone want Netflix everything installed inside that's why you buy that kind of right everything is installed inside right so
by right [ah] by right you don't need console but we are buying console temporary because
<malay>kita baru</malay> move in [what]
so that's why you want to buy it from Carousell fifty dollar one
anything [lah] #cincai#
(mm)
ya [lah]
why do you want to <malay>alih-alih</malay> [kan]
you choose a wall you choose a wall where you want your to be then we just stay like that [lah]
why you want to <malay>alih</malay>
you choose you decide
(mmhmm)
ya
(uh huh)
no
the mount is not inside the inside the wall you know
no the mount is just a hook whereby you screw into the wall
ya
then
if you take it down then you you you <malay>jalan</malay> wire right and then you just move the mount [lah] you screw it to some other wall that you want
then the screw hole <malay>yang kat lama punya</malay> wall you just paste it [lah] you cover
ya ya correct
so actually by right right
we cannot move the
because there's only one wall
beside the gate
[ah] okay <malay>faham</malay>
but let's say you want to <malay>alih</malay> you want to <malay>alih</malay> where where you want to move it
ya [lah] where you want to move it because
the main wall is right now the the main wall is beside the gate right and then and then after that (uh) beside that wall is already the window
then after that is already the wooden <malay>punya punya</malay> fake wall
so
you can't really move it anywhere
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[ah] <malay>tukar</malay> mood [ah]
(mm)
okay
okay fair we can do that
but then that means you won't have your feature wall <malay>macam rumah</malay> #shah# [lah]
because <malay>rumah</malay> #shah# is already permanent like that because he go and buy the big big feature wall
then <malay>jalan</malay> wire <malay>kat belakang</malay> [lah] <malay>berlampu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa semua</malay> all the lights all the lights
you cannot do that you know
but if you want but if you put on top of console why you want to <malay>tampal</malay>
but if you want to move it
let's say you want to move it <malay>depan tingkap</malay>
then the lights shines at the <malay>tingkap</malay>
(mm)
(uh huh)
[ah] [lah]
<malay>memacar</malay>
(mm)
okay
then I think
this [one] put on the floor
no that [one] you put on the floor
then I think
the light
we don't <malay>pasang</malay> first
<malay>tu nanti boleh kita tengok macam mana kita nak ubahsuai bilik tu</malay> that living room
and then we decide if really want to because light anytime you can <malay>pasang</malay> [what]
[ah] so that [one] we <malay>nanti nanti dulu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
ya it will be cool
(mm)
<malay>tapi saya saya tak nak rumah tu</malay> too fancy fancy you know [what] I want it minimalistic and clean and like one solid colour or maybe okay or maybe one one colour and then maybe two shades that's it two shades of the same colour let's say if I choose grey light and medium grey
just play with the same colour palette
I don't want <malay>macam</malay> blue white orange green I don't want I don't want
[ah] and I don't want black white black white black white [ah]
I don't want like that [lah]
no I hate that no
you want the house to look like one karaoke <malay>punya tempat</malay> [ah]
but it's but it's <malay>macam pening macam</malay> I don't want to come home to that kind of house
(mmhmm)
no I don't want
I don't want
yes yes <malay>betul tapi</malay> we can do that <malay>tapi</malay> we play with shades we don't play with colour you <malay>tahu</malay> okay I want the house to look very hotel hotel #ish# <malay>macam atas atas</malay> hotel so you see <malay>atas atas</malay> hotel they use very minimalistic colour
okay and they play with shades and <malay>dorang punya</malay> furniture is
either if you want to choose wood then it's all <malay>macam</malay> classic wood if you want to choose metal they won't choose the heavy heavy kind of metal they choose <malay>macam</malay> [ah] simple [ah] structure metal
so it looks very <malay>macam</malay> nice and clean and comfortable [tau] and very fresh you don't get sick and tired of it because you're going to stay there for years
[ah] a lot of money to change cannot [lah]
[ah]
(mm)
[ah] something like that something like that
yes something like that
or or if you want to make it fancy we can go gradient [ah]
let's say let's say we choose green [eh]
[ah] the royal green for our bedroom [eh]
and then we can make it gradient that means <malay>atas</malay> light colour like the same green light colour light green <malay>lepastu pelan pelan</malay> medium <malay>lepastu pelan pelan</malay> dark green
if you want to <malay>buat macam</malay> a bit fancy
[ah]
<malay>faham tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> gradient <malay>ada leceh sikit nak buat</malay> [ah]
because
that [one]
that [one] <malay>tak salah</malay> you have to use sponge then <malay>macam</malay>
[ah]
[ah] so <malay>leceh</malay> [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> compared to your time spend
paint the entire house you <malay>nak</malay> paint gradient <malay>macam gitu</malay> so about the same <malay>tapi dapat</malay> paint <malay>satu bilik</malay> [jer]
get it
and then you have to buy <malay>tiga cat</malay>
<malay>faham tak</malay>
yes
because you <malay>nak</malay> gradient [kan] you <malay>kena beli tiga tiga</malay> shades of <malay>cat</malay> [ah]
<malay>asal tak payah</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
cannot really see
(mm)
but you still need to buy two colours [mah]
(mmhmm)
[ah] [lah]
(mm)
compared to compared to let's say you want to (uh) do
solid grey let's say grey [ah] solid one colour one shade then you just buy one big tub of <malay>cat</malay>
of paint can already
settle
let's say [ah] let's say you <malay>tak nak buat</malay> gradient
[a'ah] only one colour
that [one] save money also [ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>tahu</malay> [lah] I know

<malay>kalau tak</malay>
[orh]
ya

we need store room [ah]
ya we do need store room
because if not I don't know where else to put
I don't want to put it inside a room [ah] then <malay>macam</malay> one whole pile <malay>kat tepi tu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
then
okay [lah]
can [ah] we can do that [ah] but then
but then the store room thing
<malay>kita nanti nanti dulu</malay> [ah]
[ah]
not now [ah] [ah]
<malay>nanti nanti dulu</malay> because <malay>tu pun</malay> renovation [seh]
correct or not it's considerd as mini mini renovation
[a'ah] so still <malay>akan berabuk juga</malay> [ah]
middle next year maybe
(mm)
(mm)
it's just a fake wall and then a few <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>apa tu panggil</malay>
[ah] <malay>rak-rak</malay>
(mmhmm) a few <malay>rak-rak</malay> then okay already [ah]
(mm)
and <malay>pintu</malay> okay [lah] [oh] ya [ah] I just realised <malay>rumah makcik tu tak ada</malay> bomb shelter
[oh] is it
your
[ah]
[orh]
[ah]
[orh]
okay
okay
and then the our new house <malay>mana ada</malay> first floor
where's the bomb shelter
<malay>dia</malay> start from second floor [what]
must have [one]
is it
(mm)
okay
is it
[orh]
[orh] okay
(mm)
okay so [dah] settle the first [one]
so second room
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
you want to make it into guest room [ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
[ah]
can
(mm) <malay>boleh</malay> [jer]

<malay>kita ada</malay> our documents
you know all our paperwork then not very nice [ah] because it might get messy
and then some more if I then some more if I bring in <malay>yang tu</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
exercise <malay>nya</malay> machine
[ah] then it gets very messy then not very nice
[ah] there more comfortable I think more comfortable ask them to <malay>solat dekat</malay> the second bedroom because we are going to put in this kind of carpet remember
so more comfortable for them
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[oh]
<malay>bilik</malay> #amni# looks <malay>kecil sebab katil dia besar</malay>
[oh] not single [lah]

(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so you're still going to keep [lah]
the L shaped wardrobe are you still going to keep
you don't want to keep already
you want to change to walk-in wadrobe
so that means you're going to tear down that actually [kan] there's no wall you know is a wadrobe you know
[a'ah]
because remember when we walk into our master bedroom
<malay>kita ada</malay> this <malay>macam</malay> very short pathway [kan] actually short pathway <malay>tu tak ada</malay>
<malay>pasal makcik tu dia naik</malay> [kan] wadrobe <malay>tu nampak macam</malay> short pathway actually it's just a huge square room that's all
[ah]
what place
(mm)
(mm)

(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] like the [one] we saw in IKEA [lah]
and then <malay>tempat saya bersiap</malay> my
(uh huh)
then got space to walk [meh]
because my <malay>tempat siap</malay> is <malay>tengah tengah</malay> what so if I getting ready in the middle <malay>abeh</malay> you want to walk where got space
because your <malay>baju</malay> there [what]
[ah] [lah]
but isn't it too squeezy
<malay>ye ke</malay>
sure
[orh] okay
[orh] okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) (mm) okay
(mm)
actually [kan] <malay>saya tak suka bersiap duduk</malay> [tau]
I like to stand and <malay>siap</malay>
[ah]
a chair
[orh] okay then can [ah]
I thought it's with a chair and then <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
[ah] <malay>faham</malay>
just to <malay>taruk</malay> my <malay>barang barang</malay> makeup right
okay
<malay>faham</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
actually I don't want <malay>cermin</malay>
I don't like that kind of <malay>cermin</malay> I like this kind of <malay>cermin yang</malay> you can go up close
like I want to do my mascara or something then I need to go up close you know like that
(mm)
no I don't want to sit down I won't ever sit down when I'm <malay>tengah bersolek</malay>
I don't like to sit down
(mm)
I always stand up and do my makeup
(mm) <malay>laci</malay> [lah] <malay>laci kecil</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
can [ah] then the <malay>laci</malay> I can put my <malay>tudung</malay> and then <malay>kat atas tu macam</malay> I buy the transparent plastic <malay>rak-rak</malay> then put lipstick [lah] <malay>ke apa semua</malay>
(mm)
glass
ya
ya
because
(uh huh)
most most probably <malay>berselerak</malay>
high chance
<malay>dia tak selerak bila apa</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> the first few days that I <malay>kemas</malay>
<malay>nanti</malay> [dah] after the first week <malay>terus</malay> [dah] <malay>macam berterabur macam ribut taufan kat situ</malay>
okay [lah] can [ah]
(mmhmm)
what you mean by your side
your side of [what]
[orh] side of the bed ya you <malay>sebelah tingkap</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) side side <malay>siapa panggil</malay> side side bed
side bed [eh]
bed side table [eh]
(mm) <malay>tutup belum</malay>
okay
(mmhmm)
(mm) yes
because I was thinking if <malay>ada</malay> enough space [eh] if
I was thinking I want to put a small
couch <malay>kat kat kaki katil</malay>
you know okay when you go hotel hotel <malay>kadang-kadang dorang ada</malay> small couch <malay>kat depan katil</malay>
and then infront of a small couch you have [what]
correct
(mm)
that's where you sit down drink <malay>kopi</malay> or you want chit-chat but you don't want to be on the bed you want to sit down
you understand
(mmhmm) so instead of I want to put projector
<malay>kat</malay> wall [lah]
(mm)
<malay>gantung kat</malay> ceiling a bit ugly you know
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti jatuh kena kepala</malay>
[orh] <malay>rak</malay> [eh]
maybe maybe we can make
one simple we can drill in
one simple <malay>rak</malay>
just one plank
then after that <malay>kita taruk</malay> projector <malay>kat situ</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] then can <malay>taruk</malay> frames also
I like frames because I don't know why I like it so much
I don't know it's very nice
then <malay>macam</malay> it brightens up the room
it does <malay>dia macam</malay> you have so many memories then you can frame it up
then you can
change change the picture
<malay>cantik</malay> [what]
it does
because it's very personalised so <malay>macam</malay> okay for example you go travelling and then you <malay>beli</malay> painting or something and then you come back to singapore then you buy a frame then you nicely frame so <malay>macam</malay> it means something to you
maybe <malay>orang luar yang datang</malay> visiting <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] but you know [what]
because you are the owner of the house so you <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>aku tahu aku beli</malay> painting <malay>ni dari mana</malay> and then (uh) okay this picture was me and you from where we go
you know
!alah!
!alah!
because you want to see [what]
because okay <malay>kebanyakkan orang kumpul</malay> this <malay>benda-benda</malay> sentimental <malay>lepastu</malay> they chuck it one side or they put it in the box they put it in the album then they never look at it
or they look at it once in a few years
<malay>dia macam</malay> not very useful [lah]
because it's in an
album
ya but it's there [what]
so you are making use of it
correct [what]
[eh] don't want [ah] ugly [ah] <malay>tampal tampal tampal gitu</malay>
[dah] <malay>macam bilik budak</malay>

what it is is
you
instead of putting it in
all the boxes it at your side [eh]
<malay>apa dia buat</malay> is
you need to put the pieces
alternatively like if you are putting it at on all the black boxes put it on all the black boxes only don't need to work on the white
(mm)
yes [eh] but you can use either one [ah] either the black or the white [ah] but you cannot put on both colours
no if I put it on the black boxes you put it on the black boxes also
(mm)
and in chess you can move I think quite a few directions but for checkers or <malay>dam</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> move diagonally
but you can't move back you can only move forward
[eh] chess
[ah] chess

that way so it's very disappointing [ah] better don't plan just go you say like you will say (uh) if you plan plan plan but sometime never go to your plan because you are you are you are doing with two person you know
me and my wife if
the other side will be like (uh) [oh] no I want this one [ah] [eh] you cannot I plan already [mah] so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think [eh] want to get married it's not going to be (uh) sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later [lah] <malay>nanti dulu berbual</malay> so <malay>sekarang kita</malay> go <malay>dulu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> later part then we can plan <malay>lepas tu buat</malay> plan K (uh) getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house [mah]

<malay>tak dapat pergi</malay>
so
that time I thought my wife [eh] then <malay>kita baru kahwin</malay> [kan] so I thought she will get angry and shocked the whole airport can hear her voice but she relax already
[ha] that time [kan] I think !wah! I married a a I married a I married a rightful girl [eh]
<malay>dia tak marah dia</malay> just <malay>cakap aja</malay> !alamak! it's just I know that she's very disappointed you know
<malay>tapi dia tak</malay> expose <malay>dia punya marah tu kat</malay> airport so we plan that was <malay>macam</malay> I literally divert [tau] <malay>pergi</malay> malaysia
and then at malaysia passport I my passport <malay>lepas</malay> so <malay>dia kata</malay> can pass through [ah] my wife <malay>pergi</malay> book every <malay>yang mana yang nak pergi</malay> so that part [eh] she really a hardcore <malay>dia boleh</malay> book
hotel on the spot

so how you can say regret no no no no not not really [lah] if something like <malay>macam benda yang</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau tahu buat ni takde takde</malay> it just went well if I plan if I say that now
if I know I being I do that now <malay>macam sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>baru nak menyesal</malay> then we're going backward
<malay>kita akan ke belakang diri sendiri</malay>
for the wedding service not the goal for for us [lah]
I I'm not going to plan for a good wedding (uh) because for me it's very just a day or the marriage is is the marriage actually it's not a wedding
so <malay>tu yang</malay> best [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
marriage <malay>sekarang ni ke apa</malay> [oh] okay
