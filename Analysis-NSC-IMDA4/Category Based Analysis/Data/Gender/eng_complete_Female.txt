yes
that's considered a lot ah like start then plus bonus or plus incentive
like minimum five K
ya if you want a normal normal life like you want a house you want a car then five K I think it's the bare minimum
total
okay lah enough what
no five K one person
but that's not bad what you see your house also like like bigger than my house then your father can afford a car so okay ah
I think something right starting another business sia
like six eh seven to three jer
so it's not like very long hours
there you don't need a waitress you know you just takeaway you take the food and go
who
my mother after she pay everything right and you know that stall
is four K you know
ya then she can earn herself like that one shop like minimum three K

but
earn a lot but you say the expansion though she cannot wait for one shop she open
fusion

at where
oh really
wow
one day I should try also maybe we should go
I
ya but I think they are not earning that much as that last time with her friend
for that shop
ya I mean but I don't think can even earn twelve K though
they are at home what
that's why they
same
don't let you what
around in singapore
oh
like if they if their bike screech or something then I fall then after that I go inside hospital
uh ya ya
okay

okay lah all's good all is good so
how
um
err for me
I guess is like
okay lah lesser
customers
but
so it's so hard for people to no be able to listen then it's like I try to raise my voice but then I feel like
so how other than
work how else is the pandemic
ya lah rilek ah okay water break
but ya I think uh one of my pet peeves I guess is
kan like what's the point bro you sneeze from your nose not from your mouth so you cover your mouth for what
and
mm
you know
so it's just just from her face
like a gangster seh but then
okay uh were there other people that felt the same way as you
um
um
um
ah so like two face
just marker
I think uh
because
you know for what ya so so it's just like
maybe
some of them are okay jer
but it's just you know it's just a stupid reason for me to just like ah
ya it does
ya ya ya ya
ya but but this is why I guess
we
as millennials I guess or gen Z or whatever okay you you millennial right because you are older
ya but
because we we put ourselves online
you know even especially this recording is also online ya so
ya precisely
actually is good for you to hide yourself like you know on social media especially
um if you do want to
go on dating apps
I suggest you can use a different name
well technically but like at least is still obvious right
okay that one K K K okay that one case lah but like ya that one that one is like but ya I got see a lot of people
on Tinder also oh okay say they put in their bio like
hi I'm actually seventeen or like fifteen then I I just straight away report they just fake their birthday lah but straight away we report lah because it's like
just imagine if
um a police read or something for some reason and then it's like they ask oh why you talking to a minor and then just like
I feel like we doing podcast but ya well
um
for example you are from a royal family or something or you are someone very very important you know ah ya sia but then ya it depends on the situation but
ya
you going to get bitten
um
Maggi Maggi cup jer
which one is it the indomie one
karma wow
I wonder what they serve
trauma in karma
but then I heard uh
okay lah I just google lah just now they have no menu so how ah
I feel like
it will be a full course meal starting from
starters appetiser and then all the way until dessert
sorry I never go restaurant before but
ya either way ya it's like the seven levels of hell basically I feel like
ya
but ya if if karma were to serve me something right it will be
revenge I feel like
from
lek ah lek lek lek lek lek
uh it's just
because back then in school ah now I working full-time already lah ah so
uh I made a lot of enemies because somehow some way people just don't like me and is like is like some kind of an algorithm
for at the end at the end of every school year right I will lose all my friends
ya ya well I don't know if I lose to them or they lose to me lah but
either way is this
ya I still remember one occasion
ah secondary school
but ya because like oh my god first major exam so like you expect people to at least
just
but then well ah long story short
it's just a
when I
that night where err
whether now so
you know like those kind err high school sweetheart kind of thing it's a no from me
oh shit okay no no
and then
ya so after that
uh so I guess on that night we just decided to be together to be in a relationship not me and my best friend my and the guy so
so somehow right the next day
his girlfriend is me then I was like who sia who spread and then obviously the first person that I suspected was not even my best friend you know that was how much I love her I want to say like but that sounded a bit
ya but then then ah
um before me and the guy
err talk right
he like another girl and
ya so
ya secondary school anything can happen so
err I talk to my best friend lah and say like oh why who who do you think spread and everything then she like ah I don't know you know everything then I was like ya true I also don't know because the thing is that I somehow I was too dumb to realise that she was also in that call yesterday lah like I didn't remember that fact
you know and then
ya that's true sia
that's why okay that's why you know the phrase where
some some people do say that oh I prefer befriending those on ya ya ya
some of them is like that because they will act like everything is just like oh hi let me ask guy best friend first
some of you all you just don't try to act innocent when you're not lah
ya
but
but that's why for me is that I prefer
how do you ah say I prefer
um
ya ya ya ya ya
um
ya but ah I got I got those kind of friend before I just drop
ya
eh ya I want off topic sia but okay your turn your turn I I go I go back jurong lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
example
check out rhythm skins in latin
who knows
ya but
ya I guess karma is technically revenge lah but not from the person itself but it's just from the world
ya mmhmm thanks
ya I guess um
if okay if you okay for example if you were the restaurant yourself if you were karma yourself what would you do
for supper
not for yourself lah not so bad lah for for anybody that you feel like
I guess
okay
mmhmm
in what sense
oh bro is is he living up to the quote of like every great woman is there's a great man behind or something I know it's the opposite lah but
but let's say
ah then that means
dude
do you feel like they are insecure of themselves when they say that kan um
um
um
mmhmm
ah ya my ex also did that
um
to a certain extent
or snobbish also
exactly in twenty twenty please get therapy
ya
even
okay this one I cannot brain
women also the same what
I guess in a sense
um um
ya because I feel like we
we don't have to mansplain stuff
right is that the word
so we okay if we say that oh my god I was
I don't know ya it's just a bit only not asking for much
I the self-proclaimed resting bitch face basically
ya like very edgy in a sense
no lah you normal lah
yes
but then for her is just
it was very hard to try to make her open up as in not open up to her secrets or whatever it's just talk to me like a normal person that's it and then it came to the point where she became clingy at first for me I I she said that I was clingy because I was trying too hard to become her friend but then I was like
err
and then after that
and then like oh how I wish I was in your group then I say oh ya same how I wish I and my friend were in my group but at that point of time I already started this liking because the way she was being very possessive and jealous over me even though we were just friends ya
um ya precisely unless you're married lah that one I think
a bit can
it's
ya
okay we're just single lah that's why we talk about this
ya but maybe for me is just I don't like the way you text so bye bye
so okay I I got I always ask this question if if you had three wishes
what
will you do with it I mean what would you wish for lah you know you know like those eleven eleven kind of thing
true I agree
so okay if everything was free how will you obtain those materials
forming oh farming how do you farm an iphone
ya how
what
okay she she living in thirty thirty one can farm an iphone
well I guess but we need a lot of land though singapore don't have a lot of land how ah
get a rooftop
then for the next wish okay other than the first wish will be everything will be free second
oh
wish
so explain your comfort characters um
ya anime anime ya
can you imagine he just pop up and just answer you
I see okay so
maybe you should manifest some cash
okay so what what
okay so secondary wish is your comfort characters third wish
oh that's cute
okay if if your cats were to talk right okay for all your cats that you have
how would you
how how do think they will they will talk to you for example gizmo
what do you do
give them a character ya ya ya ya ya
okay then your other cats
do you think she will be like the queen bee of the school
okay ya got some people just like that like
ya some some people are just naturally very attractive but
ya they very nice
ya maybe she'll be like what your big sister kind of character that will be cute
am I I I I guess maybe
and then okay your other cats
you live with them what that's why I'm asking you
oh that's cute alah
oh damn
I see okay I see
mmhmm
what
ya
okay lah makes sense mmhmm
something like a lot of
but is a cat a lost kitty
ah
ah okay lah at least um
dear you still have gizmo I know you you sure gizmo a lot
and and and
mmhmm ya ya her name is baby
damn okay
ah okay how how you take a cat home
in the carrier wow the love ya
ah
cute
so does she give more or does she want more attention
ah kan
no you you can have more cats than you know than more boyfriends so
and it's and it's and it's socially acceptable
okay what at least you're not spending money on someone who who can cheat you know which cat would cheat on you
right most to most is just get fat that's it
it's fine I can always you know help you
ya get
get I don't know get scratched I guess no the thing is I like cats but
sometimes I'm afraid to approach them
I mean you live with them
ah
how then the cat never fight back
ah that's true trust on trust
yes if you don't trust there's nothing nothing will happen so many things
ah that's true true like if animals were to like you except for insects
no thanks that one a bit sus
no we got a problem officer
so okay between cats and dogs
okay
I was thinking of something but okay thanks
why in what sense
that's
oh
um
mmhmm
okay that that makes sense but you know about the law where they they are forbidding people from having cats in
ya ya but demonising but ya it's just I feel like it's unfair because
for from my perspective right cats
they are cleaner and they are they make less noise the most to most they are meows are just very soft
when they run around
damn okay
so so animals are like that also okay
ya
ya sial ah who who ask you ghost
ya
but
ya I got around my neighbourhood if I do see the big dogs they are fine they are chill it's just the small dogs I don't know for some reason they just want to approach you like don't don't
ya
glass panel
is the one at the door right the gate right
specific eh
because you angry
what why wah so specific what you do sia
ya
ah mmhmm
uh huh
I don't I don't understand sia like I feel like they they have some kind of hate or anger inside them to the point where they can just hate so much
okay ya that's right
but but if you are below one five zero that one is a different kind of temper honestly
serious
ya because it's all compressed
ya it's all compressed so if you are ya if you are power
ya that's all the short guys don't date short guys
from experience maybe it's just a stereotype please don't take this too hard
well okay
I wish I had a cat
but I feel like
I don't know I'll be so emotionally attached to it
I don't know I I emotionally attached to a lot of things for example my water bottle or whatever is it can be quite toxic ya mmhmm don't make me sound so old please
so so it's like
nah I'm not single I'm I'm I'm single but not ready to mingle okay but
but ya ya I think I'm those kind of grandmothers I think like with the family heirloom that I just I just pass pass down my granddaughter my bottle that she cannot do anything about it she sell also people will just realise it's just a normal bottle that's not much value
well gen gen Z gen zentiment
okay lah I guess ya that would be our labels from society right like gen Z and just ah strawberry generation lah all those kind of shit
but things are done what
like everyone is struggling in their own things it's I don't know
yes
yes
precisely
of course they can lah the competition not that much
ya
mmhmm
ya
I I agree but because because it's true because I mean everyone is facing the same thing no matter how how much of
how much pressure that are getting lah so very little or what I mean I feel like
the future generations will also feel more pressure because there will be
too many things happening at once especially the pandemic now like
are home based learning okay lah a lot of people struggling especially those who
are either starting their first year of like you know or poly just ah tertiary education or like even
on their last year of school
it's just like
it's a very ah ya I don't know what to do kind of thing
content morning but game is a
um
so it what it's saturday sunday just
ya I mean for school I understand but for work
uh huh so so
by monday to friday so she had like rush it through and
damn
I'm just amazed at the fact that okay I mean sure working throughout the weekend but who has a meeting at ten until one okay maybe makes sense because timezone ya
but still
ya
well
okay other than school
but I feel like ya well
we all trying our best lor so
you know they were like like what you said just now like oh I did back in my days it was easier and then like now is just like there's so much competition there's so much you know if you want to study for example nursing a lot of people are taking nursing now because of the pandemic and then ah you know like now even the tourism industry is just basically dead
you know like err ya and then like it's it's just sad because
so much time wasted so many people getting retrenched and everything
I mean at least we get to you know some of us maybe we are from like
ah from our business background then we go into like
medical background or like vice versa you know that works also
but I don't know how it will play out after
how many years lah I feel like
it will stay for quite long
getting
no no it's just about the world we we never mention any ya
ya but but also like culture wise you know like I feel like there's still this thing about tattoos and going around
ya and I thought that you know at work it was like some kind of offense you know with the law that oh you cannot have tattoos but then when I ask around is just is just the culture
or any kind of physical ah body modifications I was about to say mutilations
ya but
it's nice oh especially it's just weird that
you know if you go to poly university can colour your hair you can do whatever but then like
ya brown dark brown
slightly dark
ya but hmm that's it
it's just chicken that has been un-raw
ya
I mean it's not it's it won't affect
you know it's just
ya
ya and it's as long as you do your work you do your part that's fine you don't have to like oh because she got she got tattoo lah he he got piercings ah you know he got piercings on the eyebrow and then just like how is that distract you you just don't look ya that's it
ya but I just hope
how to say I guess our generation we have things to look out for right
ya
ya and hopefully all the other things happening will be great lah right right

okay how was your day
you have to go to work tomorrow right
in the morning kan
ya
in the afternoon not in the morning lah
mm
production meeting eh
prepare for the production meeting at the the details eh
ya
ya bit busy month
but traditionally it's the busiest month for you right
traditionally for the past
twelve thirteen years right the demand december november december but not this year right because of COVID right ah
I see
what time will you be back do you think
okay cause I need to prepare lunch
and I want to I think the kids will definitely want
to eat the fish with you lah the
I don't I think for you is best to eat
so it's best to
to cook the heavy meals for lunch
why
ya
stretch the food even further the food we have lah
so I also don't want to waste food ah okay so tomorrow then you have to continue your work but you be working from home right you'll be studying from home right
the details ah
why take so long you still have to do research is it for each slide
that sounded like writing right it's almost like writing what
but you didn't put that much effort when you were write
I have to edit the what your write your your your what your article is is it your your assignment
two three pages but you know it's like
not it's not so bad it's not so badly done I mean I'm not trying to say you did it quite badly but
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
err who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like eh that's not the famous song from tokyo square
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the tokyo square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it ah
so tokyo square actually that
it's not a a got a tokyo square concert but they perform a few songs ah
uh because there are many other things that err at that show so tokyo square was one of them so I I I remember tokyo square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word tokyo slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
to america right they don't have
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is sukiyaki ah from what I know
that's the that's the unique thing lah that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin I need you
put us somewhere then she brought me with her lah so I think one of that that's why she know tokyo square
uh
they had this show they had this
ah so you remember lah
mm
uh the open space then they put up err the stage right eh um but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like what
uh
sam willows
uh
is there a song baby jane eh
uh
four
ah
uh
uh
ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese err medium right like the malay medium
err have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
uh on the side line lah it's like the a full time job for them
uh
I mean actually added actually actually them the I'm actually say it's the
is the the talent right
he was able to
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous what
ya
ah ya the malay medium lah but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like kit chan
at that she because she performed for cats even cats ya
ya
ya
not really a band not ya like but there is a talent lah like like the singapore talent ah
nuradi nuradi nuradi is a ah ya singapore talent
ya ya ya
astro eh
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this err
not fantastic lah not like ah zizan razak though
no I think
it's only people like ah zizan zizan eh
they are more exposure ya
the theater lah that the malaysia that we went to to watch the nadrah right
I remember when M nasir was talking to a
err hady eh hady mirza
for the
err what's the talent show eh
err M nasir so err hady mirza because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube lah I I I I watched through
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose lah
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think err err M nasir asked him err hady where have you been
because he was err wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work err
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem eh
like zoe tay and that time zoe tay was the were the in she was really the talent like pan ling ling
oh
her association
no I said if you want to go you can go with
no at that time lah
ah
pass away already eh
pass away eh
retired lah
how does it look like
oh
pointed out ah
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
she's just tired you know
and um
I think that's the main reason why they retire
eh even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine oh for you you are millennial I'm not sia
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
uh I am a generation X leh
it's really the you lah but you are not the the the the people that seroja and borshak was saying lah
the they were saying that this millennials ah lazy you know lazy ah
ya
ah
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
no she said people the
so
I think ten years eh twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even err make any profit
err around the same price as seroja
uh uh
uh
slightly more lah or around the same price lah
because she already bought a she already got err her flat
err her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
she want to because she love err cycling
I think she wants to cycle near the beach lah she doesn't have to
uh
ya lah but she has wonderful legs ah
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around uh ten years or so ah
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road eh
the amber road I'm not sure maybe ah
I think I I don't think is a new condo ah
uh uh
uh it's new it's new
uh
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
and not having to borrow money from the bank
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
oh my god sex heaven
condo kan
it's very very nice
uh
because I thought I I thought she stayed at serangoon garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
uh uh
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
huh
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask lah
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
especially french so I think it's something that they
uh
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very err thrifty lah sia
rent eh
uh
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
mm
that's why she move uh
make sense right
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo lah
uh
uh
uh
so they are a bit different lah their their the way they
their upbringing is different right
uh distinction lah uh
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so lah
uh
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best lah the best usually not them lah
uh I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace eh
she he ya
ya
he went to eton know that was his socialization tau
oh I uh my father owns a travel agent company
uh
uh and then
uh
uh huh
they paid five hundred dollar a month
just to teach one subject
uh
this is doing you know
ah
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I I found out that he was educated at eton so I was like eton then dasha was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to err the people in eton but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the eton boys err russian lah
eton is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
ah ya
uh
uh huh
by russia ah no uh but uh
ya and and and the thing is is not just uh it's not just vietnam but also uh indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
err study in russia because russia uh uh study medicine in russia
I told you about this malay girl who studied russian I don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year ah to brush up on her russia before she
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to or america uh it's recognise lah
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when err kacha was telling me kacha the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to sarawak or sabah
uh
huh
money
ah
malaysia hospital recognize
uh
but she cannot come and work here
uh
uh rundy his sister she studied in ireland right
no ireland not scotland
ah
ah
ah ah
to send her daughter to australia
the pace of life is different lah
uh uh laid back
she told me that
aiyo kartini what you think is so serious and important here over there is like
so laid I mean this is sofiani who finish his
paper like one week or two weeks earlier before the deadline you know this guy and he said that we really went over to australia he just learn how to be so laid back that he doesn't really care but I know
sofiani will find it very difficult to not care lah you know
ya he will care a bit but maybe not as much as before
ya
ya
I know your auntie have to challenge with
challenges with the egypt and jordan right
right with the girls right but the guys are the ones studying local
you know ahmad ahmad stays here
ahmad was like when he switched to secular right
adi secular
ah same as ahmad right
oh
ya
strength
their strength is languages uh
ya
ya
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test leh
ya but we we found out from my
err university of
jordan and the university of
not cairo lah err al-azhar
al-azhar
al-azhar
uh it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
they don't consider a degree for al-azhar a degree
uh
don't know allahu aalam
uh
uh
ya
uh wani eh
unless they do online lah unless they do online lah but I don't know al-azhar now not that good lah
the system of learning ah
err I think ever since the the egyptian spring ah uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time lah we know that the story lah
oh now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
uh but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
err at the
uh
err visa at the jordianian embassy ah
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran lah you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the fusha
that's the that's the thing lah so they get whatever they can
uh they can throw that at your face
you know but that is the the the nature lah but then you want to get the sadat eh they call it sadat you you want to get sadat so you do that lah
let her just stay here lah let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
uh
language is a bit hard lah
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
uh
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength ah
uh I mean I have friends who who like for example murni and I have a mutual friend
err okay lah one of our girlfriends lah
so I'm not that close to her lah because
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
uh
err

can she Google whether any provided result beside kaplan
no lah I mean
we went to kaplan to register her
oh different uni
don't you think with his diploma in kaplan can she use that or not
to for the bridging oh no you cannot then you have to go this
ah
ah
it's exam-based also lah I mean written written exam
how many choices she have
but
line kan must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses eh
ya I mean with this combination diploma
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam lah kan
no choice
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
now is december
mm
orh
but part time will be what how many years three years
orh
but what is different if she's a part time students and full time student what benefit
her
orh
ah
then she's no more ah means she's tertiary student what
hmm
like I said if the the thing is whether the diploma kaplan diploma is recognised or not for all of these other uni
ya
this one is uh this one the
ah bridging ya
so you must have that diploma
at first it's was ya
it's just is it good to sit with her I thought you must go to to the school with the
ya
mm
but I mean does it change if
do you think also the same thing they might have new course new ones new courses
not very confident
the thing is when you go outside
is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside
that's the things lah kan whether you can be safe or
don't know what's going on
so that's why you have to explore okay with this diploma
one more year one more the amount you have to pay on it ya
don't waste timing
I said to him can that one is your pastime not your professional time
that depends on his portfolio
mm
so
there's something to do with maths also in in in photography
think cannot pause is it have to talk all the way is it until end
wah there's twenty more minutes to talk next subject
speaking about SAM uh
maybe if you open for english the franchise fee
I don't know you need to find out lah kan
samuel
that uh
pick up a teacher just do for english then if the teacher say okay you willing to come this time this time this time or not ah then if everything okay then okay lah kan
cause if they use two classes that means no place for us to sit around already cause the class
yours yours
ah
then it can runs let it runs lah
but it run
ah you say you either take over
you take take all
ah
and is uh people is enquiring

we won eh I represent the team also
mm one zero ah ya
jer
ya jer and I think it was harry kane yang scored

okay but I didn't really talk to him so I
ya my primary school okay lah more not a friend lah more of a classmate
uh ya whatsapp group
uh he was inside that group also and I never talk to him at all so
this was like in like primary five I think ya
ya
ya okay anyway
anyway
and then he corrected me seh
ya he corrected me and then he's like oh your english sucks
ya ya and then I left the group
ya I left the group cause
because of him lah to be honest and that was like rude what like I know lah like my english sucks at that time of point but you don't say that to a person
I don't know I I don't care
I have no idea I literally have no idea
ugh that's not the point
ah just just so rude but anyway
that incident made me want
ya made me want to brush my english ya
look at me now
ya
ya just now
we just ordered food actually I wanted to go out cause I didn't wanna stay at her place
oh by the way karisma didn't pass her driving
so what happen
uh huh
serious
me too
serious
but like before the test she look she looked confident to be honest ya
uh like she sounded confident lah ya right
eh
I think it's just the nerves ah
huh serious why
but she book already
then she should book
you already have motor just take the motor lah
okay lah actually no it's good
ya okay
auto
your head lah no need lah for what don't waste your money
you want you do ah your money right
ah then she's like she's sad she still talk about it
okay lah ya same I get the feeling
but it's okay I mean at least her instructor nice kan
her own instructor
ya
ah
ya
sort of but she but she applied for to teach
I don't know like after this english test then she will
teaching ah
this is diploma in teaching
ya diploma so she can only teach in primary school if I'm not wrong
obviously but speaking of that
ya I don't know how about you
industry
oh
oh so when what do you mean by food what manufacturing ah
like do you get
okay
food oh
oh
okay
chemistry
oh
I get it then so what could be your potential future careers with that degree
what would it be
mm mm mm
ya
mm mm mm mm
ya
I see but so interesting
ya
oh serious why
uh huh
oh
ya
uh huh
oh but why I thought she just got a full time job
I no no I don't understand I don't see the point
but it's just what she's suddenly passionate I mean like not passionate but interested or
exactly
options
okay that's true
ya ya
stick to one
okay lah hopefully
ya
but to be honest my degree also I'm also not so sure if I want ya
if I want to
ya stay or like continue finishing
huh
ya
why
alah this is why
ya honestly
but their I mean the teaching style is quite relaxed ya
ya
ya
then just try to help out each other in any way that we can
ya ya all through zoom

I was like did she just leave the house
ah
ah
mm
uh oh
ya oh my god that's really really far why why why
pity you oh ya she study
oh for ad hoc eh nice cool cool cool cool cool
school oh okay
oh for different department ah
oh then they will just photoshop people in the same group lah
eh she was at her
oh wait she is the
eh she is head ah
oh who is the vice head
oh yes yes yes yes oh my god
I like I was like trying to think who is the oh K K K yes yes yes
ya
ha ha does you feel like not being in ad hoc this year that's great
I'm proud of you for caring about yourself
volunteers
oh because they're not gonna do any physical okay
ah I see err no eh they haven't recruit volunteers for I say members
no not yet don't think so
ya
putting it on record is not your problem
no lah I think cause they are still trying to secure the heats
so if there's no heads they can't get the members
that will be kind of weird
mm ya ya ya
oh
oh okay okay that's interesting
do you miss it like joining something at least
mm do you intend to join
like next sem
don't know I feel like
um like when I join when I was in year two it was purely for the sake of okay trying out new things right and I tried both ad hoc and sub comm
experienced what I need to experienced in ad hoc ya
I feel like
I think I was like oh like it wasn't that great experience
and so I don't think I want to join again not in my last semester lah
yes last year best year
like I that was right so I am doing other shits instead of doing school stuff
that's the way
okay set set
Muzmatch next sem
I try before I try before no no not me I ask my sister to download so she was like
I feel she was like ya
it was that like it will it will really bring you to the guys tau so you can just swipe right or swipe left
and then like we saw the guys I was like oh my god there was a okay lah
you can just
ya
I actually I think so I haven't really use other apps
I don't think can
I don't know actually maybe we never look through it hard enough to find where to delete
ya so like
we swipe up one guy
nothing within the hour she deleted the account after that
didn't see it but ya so I think
I think you have to complete your profile first so when you because we never upload her her profile or everything right
then there were we it was a limit of ten guys I think
ya so we only manage to see ten guys so out of the ten guys we only swipe up one guy
come here looking for like eh it is
but I I guess that's the whole point of um Muzmatch and also like like half our deen right the app this dating apps but the half of our deen is
so that was how my aunt got married
ya so ya
so at one point I think she was tired of finding guys she just wanted to
just go all out and try and then like okay so she she knows what she want she's like okay I'm serious I want to get married I wanted do this I want do that right I want I know what I want in a guy and so she join half of our deen
I think half of my deen or half of our deen I can't remember and then um
she met this guy so like err he is from another country
but like he comes to singapore and wants wants to do work and stuffs I think
and then he came to met her and the parents of her
nd then now they are happily married but now she lives in australia
ya we want international guys
sure sure ya
that was kinda kinda
cool
the I think because
half of our deen need you can have like yearly subscription or like I forgot what else ya I told my sister um by the time she reach a certain age
and she still no guy I can help pay for her subscription
if she wants
mm
is it
I didn't know
oh okay okay
I feel like Muzmatch when you want to create the thing right they will actually ask you
how halal are you ya ya they will ask you about prayers so like the question was oh like how often do you pray then there is like sometimes most of the time everytime that kind of thing
I feel like that's the I feel like now that you said it I feel like there was one of the questions that was asked ya so in their profile they will show
I think I wouldn't mind I would say I'm not against it
it's just I I feel like
um not saying any couples out there who met through dating apps like you guys can be happy but like
I feel for me if I want to fall in love with a guy I have to know the guy in real life first
you fit the ideal in because sometimes it's like act it's like you say things and you show things that you want people
to perceive of you that doesn't mean that they are truths about you
I like I rather go through the process of finding these things out myself about you and then I decide like I don't need
um this interface to tell me okay ya
mm
ya
opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instance if people around him keep saying that oh my god it's such a nice person and he doesn't this this this then I'll be like okay see it's like he's kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya and then that's kind of hard to to do with a guy that you meet on a dating app because you don't know the his friends
right you only know him and after that if he chooses to let you in on his social circle then you will get to know his friends but besides that
you only have him ya but like you will say lah like if that's important then
meeting a guy in real life whom you know through like mutuals and everything is more important
eh do it leh let me be the why
but you can tell from okay so because my sister friend
join Muzmatch for quite a while and she dated a guy on Muzmatch but like she told my sister that the guy is that uh
um quite trashy
it is so like I said like the things that they put on your profiles doesn't reflect
what who they are in real life you know I mean
ya so ya she dated a guy and then she broke up cause the guy was just too
eh
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
I guess um
when you this is very superficial lah but I guess when you do it in real life
it makes you come across and that's desperate
ya because nobody knows how many guys you are talking to in in a dating app you see
you can be talking to twenty guys and that they they just think that like I mean they probably won't think you are talking to them alone because you are on a dating app but it feels like you are talking to them alone
but if you were to do it like in uni context for example when it's such a small social circle
and you put yourself out there and you
you know try your very hard right then it that case becomes desperate
ya
correct I know like I before I join um ad hoc and stuff like people already
say lah you know did like people like actually join ad hoc and stuff for the sake of
ya so actually that that was what
turn off people from joining ad hoc last time
like during before like during that time when I wanted to join
I don't know
what's like your ideal date
ya lah
I would like to know
ideal date no I don't think so
mmhmm
mm
oh
mm mm
so is that your ideal date or your ideal first date
first date ya
I I don't think that's anything is too much
I think it's up to people preferences
ah because
watch the movie what do you mean okay then
oh
I mean it opens up doors to topics of conversation afterwards like
ya
ha your date how long
um okay K K ya trekking sounds like a great great ya
okay I first date
I like nature so
I will look so unglam
like just
I I won't I won't dump it on scene on the first date I don't want you to run on the first date I'm gonna capture him first you know
like I will wait for like a few months
maybe like the second month ya oh let's go trekking then we see how lah
I like I like going outdoor so so so maybe I would like a picnic
ya
right ya
like I would like a picnic then we paint
ya right
like like I don't know like I had seen my friends who are couple and then go a picnics
ya
ya so sweet
it's so beautiful
ya then after that we watch the sunset
right
oh no oh my god
okay if let's say you are on a bad date okay
would you ghost on him half way or would you
they just went toilet and then they never come back
mm
ah
okay so it depends on how bad the guys is lah
ah I see
ghost
ya so that was this um they were talking about their dating experiences so there was this person who said that he was catfished
um on a dating app you pretend to be someone else
or you pretend to be something very different from who you are like you don't have to pretend to be someone else but you can just pretend to be younger or older or like
shorter or taller that kind of things so
then he was catfished by a much much older woman like at at that point he was only
nineteen eighteen ya
I think so lah ya then after that he was catfish so when he came right like
he saw the lady was much older at that point is so young right and then like um he just went to toilet
and then he just never come back
ya
mmhmm
it is
I mean
I think if I was catfished
the the the guy obviously deserves to be ghosted
because like why in the world would you lie to me in the first place
ya right
that's why
like I don't think that's a nice way to present yourself
ah I forgot the name like the dating ya ya ya ya
that's this thing um that you date
the girls on one side you guys on one side and then the girl and the guy will enter the same room but they cannot see each other
show uh that day I just find it
ya and then err so basically they will get to know each other through those rooms for like a few days
and then after that like if they like each other right they they can continue meeting each other through those room but they cannot see each other so when they can see each other is when the guy or the girl if you want proposed to the other person
so only when they are engaged
then they can meet and this all happened within one month
have you watched that so far it is it is
I I really forgot what's the show ah cry
maybe just finding
kan
just you know
I mean at this oh love is blind yes yes yes
ya love is blind is it was a pretty interesting show actually
err ya ya ya it is it is
like out of
ya
so even then there were a lot of dramas and everything because you can only meet the person so
at that point it was really a matter of
um they will basically they were trying to prove like does looks matter do looks matter
ya like in in a relationship
so at that point because you cannot see the other person so it's really about
whether you can really appeal to this person just through your personality lah
mmhmm mmhmm
would you ever
no I I would be
I I feel like ya but like but like
I I think in matters to some extent that I get to see who I'm interacting with and potentially get engaged to you know
ya
mm
mmhmm
mm mm
match making ah
um yes yes I guess it is the same thing like
ya but I guess that one is it's kind of sad lah cause they don't have a choice you know
ya
what change
that's nice too right
I used to set deadlines for myself okay twenty five I must get married
ya it is
ya really is right but like that was when I was like still young and naive and just thought like ah you know
ya twenty five sounds like a good age after uni ya
and I no guy also like where am I going to look for
guy ya like
my batch mates tau I understand seniors but my own age
ya ya like
shit
ya ya kan is
is I feel like it's really stupid like the the fact that
can only apply where people can only apply if they are getting marry and stuff and then like how the age limit to buy an apartment
the law says it's thirty five years old like I think that's really stupid
err ya and also like
I think the government also want people to procreate right so like they want people to get married have children so that's an incentive for them
yes
yes hazimah
for women our future generation to suffer
ya
oh my
actually ya that's a good thing ah and I I've thought about this my answer is no lah I don't think I'm willing to have children
at it like in this knowing that the world is like this
nonsense nonsense it is it is and like
I don't know like I don't think I want my children to grow up in singapore
like not it's too stressful then
to be a minority in singapore it's something like in other countries you will still be a minority
true
true true true it's just that for a country that price itself over
multiculturalism multi racialism whatever
ya
I saw I saw my history teacher posted this on story
um to my sec four students uh here like um no actually is like oh uh
both she teaches both so she was like here is a good
oh I'm proud to live in singapore err to my sec four students here is a good example of multiculturalism
and then just like right right and then I'm just like
but like you see you can always find minorities doings stuff to be
to like make an effort to accept other cultures but you don't see majorities doing that the same for minority cultures
so you can't possibly say that is multiculturalism if it just fits into
your ya
correct and then I was like oh K
no I haven't have you but I saw snippets of it
oh god
I saw I saw yes
about like oh like why did you not care about politics oh because is fatally boring right it was like it's boring
it's boring to you because you don't care about the or you don't care to change about the world that fits you perfectly ya
that's exactly what I discussed with a friend that I fell out with
you know like
it is but
no it's not some disagreements and like like I said to this friend like
it's not something that you can just agree to disagree not when my rights are
being violated you know like when not when I'm denied these rights
um have privilege over
you know it comes easy for you and that's why you can just choose to say I don't want to care about politics because it's so boring and it doesn't concern me but for me
politics is so deeply entrenched in every aspect of my life and for you to say that
uh like being so nonchalant about it it it hurts me lah because then do I even matter to you
because I feel like if you want to be
um you uh
are a majority in this country right you have a lot of power and privilege
and if you're not willing to do something with that power and privilege
then you're just being an oppressor already you know if you are not on the side of the oppressed you are with the oppressor
ya
I so
perhaps it's also because if they acknowledge that chinese privilege exist then they have to
face the fact that you know the there's this inherent problem in the system
that is damn perfect suits them perfectly but denies
uh huge like minority groups of the same rights and privileges you know then then they will have to to you know they know that there needs to be changed by they are unwilling to go through that change because it brings inconvenience to them ya
ya
um
and then like talking about Mendaki system uh subsidies and stuff and like
prove that no chinese privilege ya
ya it's just um
it's just
ya I feel like
when people say that oh you want more why why is it that you need more many represents or more minority representation
for you to hear minorities kind of what they face ya right like why do you need so is that you only hear people with power
what then then who are you really representing that you are not representing the people's voices you are representing yourselves people with power amongst yourselves
yes yes that's
ya so
ya it's true true but you see why is it that we always have to compare with other countries why can't we just compare with our own and admit that it's sucks
ya
I don't think you should just compare countries across countries like that
which countries
ya I agree with you like
there are other form of oppression that minorities face in singapore it doesn't have to be
oh because oh like other countries if you are muslim you die you know but in singapore like there are oppressions like hijabi don't get to wear a hijab all the time
there are instances at work where they have to remove that and that is something conflicting with religion and
you know being in workforce
ya
ya
ya like
ya it's like oh we should be grateful that we are giving you some rights oh oh okay
ya like
ya like okay can then like
coming from a I feel like a
I would say privilege background
like I was very um
blind sided to all these issues that was prevalent to this society
like I was
I feel like I was like always trying to be accepted in
ya ya
ya
ya
took a lot of unlearning to finally accept that you know what
it's okay like
ya like I'm proud of being who I am and I shouldn't care about what others
like
I mean that's how conversation works
oh my god like ya
ya I feel like recess week is ending kind of fast
no no no no don't say that by the time you said that suddenly it's sunday already
yes

no lah can can make sure you take good care of yourself
no there is no such thing as too good care of yourself
that is nonsense
you can't say it
oh what what which do you like best

I already know mine but it doesn't live in the zoo

oh okay okay

I love cheetahs I love cheetahs for my entire life
yes
and I get by basing their cause there's like cheetah leopard yes
leopard yes yes yes
do you know that cheetahs don't roar do you know what sound cheetahs make
oh my god I would love to show you no they do not
they do they do make noises but
they do not call for kor kor
hold on ah
my favourite word sleep
I don't know eh dude there's one
no this is a full grown cheetah
the purr but it meow
and then they also make some okay you listen to the beginning right they actually make some other sound
ya them they make this sound
don't know
kan
like I
I love them so much I love cats any any kind of cats
ha ya they are all cats
they are so cute
like I want to meet a cheetah one day
oh
ya like why should they be in the cage
aduh
ya additional five dollars for the boat rides then I was like pe and then
not actually a lot of things is not on the river a lot of things is
no idea maybe there's a river there that's all
right and then I feels like ha maybe cause like can go first
a bit like a roller coaster kind of
really inside the lock right it's like a lock right there's a mechanic you know so you just go through it's like a ten minutes ride
no I thought it was going to be real but it's not
but but uh kai kai or jia jia whichever is the female one she's pregnant yes cute
then like they like she had to she couldn't come out lah she was she rested in
in his own enclosure
ya
like the I think kai kai is the guy one kai kai was um
ah menopause ya
the jia jia was just sleeping like rolling around sleeping
I love pandas they are so clumsy just
yes
yes
does it include animals
babies like on where instagram
maybe that's why your algorithm is just on this yes ya
mm that is interesting I think mine is also on
shows that
ya
shared to everyone in the world because some things are so intimate like
ya like I was saying um
so intimate to you guys I
maybe different people have different perceptions of what is intimate to them but in my opinion this kind of things are
I don't know it's just
true
true true true true I
I would say that I can agree with that of course like I I'm all for you know normalising guys crying and miscarriages happen in huge like
be able to talk about it openly but as you know it's just
ya ya
so ya I don't know like
they are like
I see
ya
there is this I have this favourite couple the guy is so sweet and then like there was like a date the girlfriend did a challenge called my husband and then the guy was like oh
my heart you just called me your husband
oh so cute
I guess maybe like at that stage they still don't know yet but then when someone says it like that it gives them more reassurance that one day it's gonna happen you know
you you can try lah like oh like do a live oh my husband here then like
then your mother follows you right later your mother oh okay lah then your friends then
I've never thought of it that way
I've heard like a lot of times people like the the people the guest coming to the wedding are not really people that you
know or are close with they are just people that you invite because it's a formality that you have to maintain relationships yes yes
with family members ya
kan and like in this pandemic like you
it is telling lah that that's actually you don't actually need to invite a lot of people you can just stick two hundred people and and that's it
you know
ya so
inshallah
putting it out there yes I think my my family won't be nice too
okay lah good luck to my sister then

hi
okay ya
what do you mean what happen today
oh okay so basically
huh
yes I did oh my god I'm exhausted but like did I not like I had don't think I got tell you but like a girl got her new MacBook today and then you are the first one I'm calling on my MacBook she's beautiful she's gorgeous
oh my god ya okay so I ended up buying the gold one apparently on Apple it says gold but then actually it's rose gold like she's like gorgeous and she's obviously rose gold not gold so I don't know whether people are blind or something
I like yeah she's gorgeous
what about you what have you been doing baby
orh
okay then
you like on apparently on the freaking website it says gold but then the actual thing is actually rose gold like it's very very tinted pink
ya so there's that
yes girl girl bought MacBook air
cause she's airy or what
err
I don't know I upgraded some shit and I don't know what
so like around one seven
some
sushi for two dollars and I solid like contemplated for a solid ass like five minutes in front of that thing and I was like I think the uncle was just like
I thought he was like thinking I'm gonna take some like twelve dollars sushi and then I proceeded to take a two dollars sushi I was just standing there just like
should I buy should I no but I'm broke I'm broke I have to last like fifty dollars for the next like three weeks or something like that then I want to go drinking and all that blah blah blah I'm like um
there's that there's that tea
okay so that day
no
I had always had money then after that when I realised that I wanted to buy the a new laptop
then I just set aside all my money and then I started
working to hit one point seven so at the start I think I had about one K already then I need seven hundred more so last month I was broke to get that seven hundred and then now I got the seven hundred then now I'm broke cause I have no money at all you know what I mean
I was
but I had this amount of money and this entire amount of money is set aside for my baby ass laptop my baby boo so I am broke okay girl girl doesn't lie
kay
so that day I was
um
going to
I don't know who I was meeting
then
I remember like
this
I don't know why I like just suddenly I was just on the train and then apparently like we pass by Admiralty then I think I saw somebody who looks similar to him or not I just don't know so um
so
since I don't know whether I got tell you this story ah like since
um primary six
so my mum will go to this auntie's house
so it's like super complicated then my mum I don't know how she just
then since primary six up until last year because COVID was this year what so up until last year I will always have to go to her house to cut hair
this auntie has a son who is two years older than me okay
even though I have a thing for Chinese guy he's not ugly when you have like put it on a Malay scale if there's something like that ah give me a Malay name
kay let's just use
hais neither do I but like there is one there is one
kay
let's just use
okay let's just use his name ah
so his name is #Adi#</P2
then like she will like when she will like
yeah his name is #Adi#</P2 something
ya I think
like it's a long name ah but let's just use a generic one ah then after that
so
then after that like I will just avoid the question just act blur sotong and all that all lah I don't know what I will do lah I cannot really remember
everytime she asks questions like do I have a boyfriend
or all that I will let my mum talk lah
then I will just never talk to the aunt even eh the mum even though like
the questions are posed to me
so last year right dude
then I was just like
huh
err I'm like my fucking future is a freaking pitch black hole and this base is like
number one
not even a single word to the dude you know not even one word can you believe it she wants me to marry a guy that I have never even said hi to
like hi like I don't even know how his voice sounds like that's the problem right now
like they will just laugh and then they will just like like that like that and then I'm just like I obviously know you you're talking about me and laughing and like you know teasing me but like why like I've never even spoken to the dude before and I don't know why
how I cut my hair
ah the last time I went to an actual barber
ya so after I told huh
no after I told my mum that I was genuinely uncomfortable with everything we stopped going there
it's been sometimes since I went to the house already
ya cause the harassing or like I don't know whether is considered harassing or not it's kinda cute
if you think of it in one perspective it's really cute
but if you think of it that it's been happening since primary six I'm kinda traumatized is how many years already
um
I don't know baby but what about you do you not ever had harassed

I don't know lah okay like I've never been cheated on so I don't really know like now I can tell you like straight up like oh if he cheats on me I'm leaving his stupid ass but like
in that situation you never know what like
if you really love someone then
I don't know
huh
what
ah
mm
mm
Serangoon a'ah
okay
you're already late
confused
ee oh my god dude
oh my god okay okay I also have a story to tell you okay it's like kinda similar so my friend met this guy like recently okay so they've been talking
like from then until now is only been two months okay one month into knowing
err one month into knowing each other
they got together
and then recently I met her so it's going to be about two months but not really um I heard that
the dude already met the girl's mum
on an actual like they actually plan the thing you know I was like thinking
like we actually planned a day for her mum to meet the guy and then I was like
huh
and then apparently like this coming okay I mean today is what day Friday so apparently they say either Saturday or Sunday the girl my friend is the one that is now my friend is going to meet the guy's mum
or or Sunday
yeah
yeah
don't you think it's fucking fast first of all right they've been they've known each other for less than two months got together in less than one month and have been together for two weeks and within that span of two weeks both of their parents like they met both their parents so the first week of getting together the guy met the girl's mum and then the second week is the girl meet the guy's mum
isn't that a bit fast
and then this one
ya and cause he's Chinese but like
I cannot comprehend
like you know they took for less than two months and then you are confident enough
that
you bring
even if I start dating like while lo and behold
I go and date some Malay guy I am sure as heck not gonna like ask him to come meet my mother in the first two weeks of getting together
okay
maybe not even like one year
so like I don't understand
how does this work
what the heck like it's cute
that the guy actually
but like one week into getting together though
I don't know
like just touch wood lah imagine if you don't
have gotten together in the first place ah of knowing a guy for less than one month
but then there's also #Saif#</P2 so
Rudy Aip what's up
okay cool
huh
what
what
huh
wait what I cannot even comprehend that
are they still together
to get out of jail
ah
because I met another person
like the effort
I don't know babe like you cannot really judge
like
I don't know
I don't know man
oh ya sia like I don't know recently like
I I get both sides cause you know as a girl you want reassurance but like you cannot deny you want reassurance but then the fact that you are asking for reassurance about something so far fetched
is very weird like
cause
in but I would like
want him to tell me like hey we're gonna be in this for the long run lah
so okay so
um
there's this one friend of mine
like
um her name is Amy</P2
then like
ah
ah yeah yeah yeah so
most of our friends like our mutual friends are like dating like have been dating for like five years or whatever like really really long so they actually know let's say like
we're gonna get married here this day eh this year and like we are gonna plan for it lah like they actually have a plan like a future Amy</P2 has been together with her boyfriend for like a solid five months
and then her boyfriend is the logical type okay like Amy</P2 and me are the same we're like fucking romantic and be like baby I love you I love you from the moon to the moon back whatever bull crap right and then the guy is the type that won't say anything that
he knows it's might not be true you know
so
um she's then recently she got jealous that
her boy like her friends are like all thinking about marriage and future and then
like her boyfriend doesn't even want to say like she will say shit like
oh I hope it's going to be you in the end or like I hope it's you
the rest of my life that kind of shit and then like he will just dodge the entire thing
and then she got so sad
and then
she got so sad that now she wants to try a fucking keto diet
she wants to try let me reiterate and repeat these again okay she was so sad that he doesn't want to you know like
give her reassurance that he's gonna be there for her like
till the end then she wants to do a keto diet so that she can be skinny
that body goals I don't know man it's just a whole ass mess like she's just so sad
there's that but then you also need
ya I just that's why I was thinking like I get her point of view like I get it cause I really think that if you really love someone
no matter what
you still want reassurance that they're gonna be there
for a long time
because you love them that much but then like if you compare it like five months and five years is two different things ah
no I just got blocked nose
I don't know why
suddenly like throughout this thing suddenly got blocked nose I don't even know why
but yeah there's that
I just like
ah
ya so the next time Russell</P2 asked me to drink there you better bring your ass down
and then if #Saif#</P2 texts me I'll let you know
there's that
there's so much
huh
ah ya that's why how to go drinking I ask #Russell#</P2 pay ah #Russell</P2 my daddy

but like Sushi Deli isn't any cheaper though
when I went there like seriously
what is it and it's actually halal but it closed down but ya that one
ya fifty cents
ah
I should have taken everything
finish ah
I never
before Andalus I started in primary one so I think when I was like in kindergarten like for two years I was at
have you heard I think you've heard about it before no
yeah
so
um
but okay so the only thing I don't even remember going there you know but the only thing that I remember oh my god I love my whole story is that right
I came back home
one day from school cause my parents will always fetch me cause it's like in the middle like it's not even in
but is in the middle of a road
and then after that right like
after that
um
one day I went back home and then I just told my mum
ma somebody kiss me on the cheek
I'm a fucking kindergarten kindergarten is what fucking six years old or five five to six years old I went back home I was like ma somebody kiss me on my cheek and then my mother was like the fuck is wrong then after that they realised right that
but like they went right
was like a family friend
then like
I remember like they will talk about it so recently like they will just say you know like instead of saying the guy's name or the mum's name
ah then I was just like
somehow
it's so weird so it's kind
I cannot remember but the only thing I can remember is what my mum is telling me which I did
and then I was just like
it's damn weird
ya so ya there's that so I don't know about you but girl girl got kissed at the cheek when she was five
I hate myself so much I was such a hoe
at such a young age
you know
okay we cool after so much shit and then #Aisyah#</P2 story's is just not done okay then
my mum I guess
that
are you serious
can it be cured
oh my god
um
my god she's another #Wati#</P2
huh serious ah
like
like how did it go from
her to your mum so fast
can you imagine our batch having a reunion but okay cool but besides the point
but selected people or what
oh
that is not a reunion but okay kinda like okay
um
mm
some fucking vicious cycle right there
mm
mm
what
ya like why are you putting words into my mouth like what do you know
whether
or like what
so like ya in conclusion you really attract toxic girls
or friends I guess
okay that's a bad thing to say lah how are you supposed to make friends if you don't want to tell people
about
the things that bother you
but then really though like genuinely you really attract
really bad people but then we are friends so I don't know what am I saying about myself
I like
yeah
am I like your first stable friend
like the mentally stable like the one that is not about to burst into a bubble everytime
is #Ain#</P2
and Eileen</P2 not considered a stable friend
ten years later
ya tell her the tea that she's gonna get next is me sitting on Kahir#</P2>'s lap to beat the bitch up
to make
ya but there's that
but like it's okay
I'll be okay
I will forgive and forget girl girl
will not
succumb to being such a big bitch
I know right
it's so freaking fun
you know it's just like fuck
I don't know like motor is fun but I want a car
cause girl girl can drive and
you know safety and all
but like motor is fun
yes
bye bye baby
bye

it's so long since I've seen you
so how are you
oh really
how is it
oh
so ya because like I I wanted to go uni right but I didn't get in so I will try next year but for now like I need to find a job so is quite difficult lah because of the pandemic also it's like uh it's like very limited with the jobs so hmm
oh ah cashier job
oh that no that one temporary I mean they did ask me to extend lah but I it's not something that I want to do for like a long term you get what I mean ya ya cause like cause I work you know at there right like as the cashier so have to deal with like a lot of like like for you lah your one is also elderly right then
ya we also have to deal with a lot of elderly like for example like ah we got we got the you know the senior senior discount right on like certain days so I think it's ya no no no it's uh like uh for the elderly citizens like those sixty years old and above right if they buy their groceries on like for example wednesday they get a discount
ya so that's why I'm not working there anymore because it's quite difficult
right oh really ah
as in she working oh
oh
ya eh she working as cashier also ah mm
um I think I got make like a few mistakes lah once because I was just new what then I like had to do the cashier all by myself right because usually at the start right they the aunty will be beside you to help you so like after like a few weeks right then ah you have to do the cashier part alone
so ya then I got make a few mistakes like like something to do with the money lah I mean ya then after that uh the manager and the supervisor didn't scold me so I guess that's good like they were very nice about it ya even though it was ya
ya lah we need to pay back ya we need to pay back but like below five dollar don't need to pay back but if above five dollar need lah ya but so far never ah
oh ya got this one point of time when I was just new then like I was doing with the aunty lah so apparently like I think I miscalculated leh then got like a shortage of like ten dollars you know like ten dollars or more
ten dollars more ya because I think was fifteen dollars so five dollar offset right and ten dollars she need to pay well I I was supposed to pay ah cause I think I was the one that did the mistake lah then after that my aunty insist that she will pay for me so I felt so touched by her ya because they they're all very nice there ya ya I think it depends on the outlet lah
ya
oh my god
ah so nice luckily the uncle
so ya I don't know if it's like some of them may be on purpose or what lah but okay maybe there are others who really not on purpose then sometimes the card will have a error like they will say try again or payment not accepted or something so that means
ah pay on the spot right then the machine cannot use like ya so that's why is like we have to be like attentive lah also but also some of the customers like I think ah some of them are like purposely like never pay then they just walk off ya
ya ya cause some some of like okay lah the one that time cause I work with sophia right then she had to pay like how much ah eighteen dollars like she had to pay ya because the customer walk off then like she cannot find a customer
ya ya luckily only eighteen sia imagine if the person buy like hundred dollar plus or what wah that one is like is like one week pay leh
oh ya okay I wanted to talk about the the ya wait what's her name fadreena is it fadreena so you met her from right the try out
hmm
oh no okay wait so my friend ah I don't know if you know her lah is she's the one that wear the hijabi she I mean hijab the she's my secondary school friend lah
so apparently she and the fadreena they are in the same course I believe it's ya same course but they are not classmates lah so apparently uh my friend she went to japan that exchange program with the school right
then after that the few the next few days kan um the fadreena was like getting close to my friend's friend so like there were times when they would just like she would like go into the hotel room right
then like ah the japan trip also like she was the fadreena was like very like I don't know like the vibes of her was very off and then like they cannot click because I think also fadreena like I don't think you know her much lah but her personality quite strong
ya then there was this one point of time I think they were like making fun of each other lah fadreena and my friend then because ah then like she they I mean she said something hurtful about my friend like say uh I forgot what ah
very bad from then then ah oh ya recently cause that time I met with her so the my friend naziha right she said like the fadreena sent her a long long text
saying like um what ah why you go around behind my back saying about me and all that when the last time they talk right was like two years ago because that that the the japan trip was like two years ago mah
so from then my from then on right my friend never talk to her because like obviously like they can they cannot click right so why would she talk to her right so ya and then suddenly like very recently she ask she just sent that long text ah of like why you talk behind my back then my friend also like huh I also never talk behind your back for what then also because she got like a boyfriend right I think I don't know is
ya
ya I mean like I don't know like so pretentious the vibe

like I think she he cannot move on from her lah then the ex also is like now quite successful already so he's uh working under certis cisco then his pay quite good lah from what I see
then he say like I have everything now but I don't have you so like the only thing that I'm I need is you then my friend also like uh like contemplating lah cause like she when she was with her ex for like two years when he was in so now she has to start back from square one

no cause like uh I mean she likes the guy currently lah I mean she really loves him from what she say but because the guy also must like I don't know why but she she keeps comparing the current with the ex like the way they were in well when they were in lah so like apparently the current one right now is not giving like uh how to say ah like
uh my friend right she gave a lot the guy like as in like efforts lah not not as in like um money or what but like giving like effort like making handwritten letters and all that and then um buying him chocolates and all then but then um the guy never really like

obviously lah everyone will aim for that spot got shade what
it's two onwards
I would think we'll reach there three plus ah this is our plan B
um
but I say that will be very suspicious
he always park there then like
it's like it's like we might be meeting someone
I told them that
ya lah like caught them off guard kind so
yes
yeah can
ya
you must you must give the poker face like nothing is happening
no
he will definitely follow
uh on your birthday I already have something planned so you know
almost two years
eh or is it more than two I don't know lah but
long enough lah
ya
anyway
ya then that's sort of like the deciding factor ah then I said okay then another if if let's say
then we go Marina Barrage because it's easier
what was the deciding factor again I forgot ah
no okay wait no if we have a car we go to Marina Barrage
I don't like to waste time
yes yes
but
then I'm like he cannot lah
yeah
yeah
I honestly think Marina Barrage is a good idea
but but
okay I'm okay no okay oh wait wait wait
no we all like the activity we all can agree on that it's just that we know that we are starting late oh yes I remember the deciding factor
yeah
weekday cannot lah he what
then
so you see three plus
we can enjoy the activity the package got five different place you know
where got time to
no no we didn't choose that there there is a package with cable car but we didn't choose that
no
it's not really
I know got Shah Rukh Khan
you've been with me at Hong Kong
what I say just now
no then like oh yeah that's the deciding factor because sometimes
say he don't want to go for class ah he skip that week's class
yeah
then I but I told her lah uh whatever it is we don't be the one to tell him
we don't be the one to tell him not to go for the class lah it's wrong
yeah
yeah I mean if he wants to let him decide on his own
if he
Tampines ah
I think ah
no actually don't know
I think he usually come back Tampines he don't like to go back that house
no lah but he he always bring motor he will always pick up her first and she stay near Tampines hub there
so
no
near Tampines hub
yeah
yeah but ya lah he he likes
yeah
ya ya that's the deciding factor now I remember
attraction in Sentosa
yeah
six last eh entry eh something like that
ya lah which which means that there is five activities so if from three o'clock you wanna cut cake eat first that will be four plus already
cause we bring a small cake
err it's very he
yeah well they all want it that way
I okay jer
yeah
I give my opinions but you know uh eventually I feel that the one that has more say is the girlfriend lah cause
she would know how to get him there or
I like surprising people
I'm pretty good at it
but yeah I mean there will be a time where I'll be like you also right
so let me enjoy my youth
let me enjoy my youth okay
yeah but I really I really hope that we go Marina Barrage
yeah it's simpler
then like
food lah estimate
he said last time he went he paid three hundred plus
but but with eleven people
then like I got a shock ah I'm like what in the world three hundred plus
all guys yes I must add that all guys
so it's like
and it was during the time so they are probably really hungry
and I was telling them ah
I was telling them uh I'm a very picky eater you know and like I don't know what's there so
I was saying that to the girlfriend
yeah
then
I don't I told her I don't eat satay
I really don't
yeah
eh but the place looks nice they wanna go DuitSg actually
I don't know but I know it's a famous place right now people are always going there
Canberra Canberra
DuitSg
uh they sell their specialty is what ah
I don't I don't eat this kind of thing lah okay
I hate that question because like I really don't know where to go
you just make up your mind and then I follow
it's okay lah just go with the flow if cannot then cannot lah
we can just like
but like
very light food lah
cannot eat cannot eat I okay jer
um
hmm
uh eh mm
that that that that's a
that's a good
then I'm like
then I'm like okay guys anywhere I don't know much you all decide about food
ya about food I really don't care
all I need is drink
I okay as long as I have water bottle with me
yeah
it was super hot bro
ya ya they did mention that
ya
anyway ya so that's the plan lah
um
then we talk about like other things lah
she you you can tell that she really put in effort to
yeah
that's what she say ah
I do a lot of things so
I'm like uh I think FaceTime better ah but like ten thirty onwards
ya so ten thirty onwards yesterday they call me until one plus
ya then
who the two guy friends and me that is our clique we have other friends but
Arshad
one big group
yes yes yes that's right
so he is in that big group
okay in that big group there's the three of us
inside got that circle three of us then inside this big group got another
slightly bigger circle the one that come over to eat
yeah lah you know
those people
no those people lah
those people are like the other group
overlap meaning
oh the thing is uh out of the three of us that two guy friend and me
yeah so so
so he he said what for attend such thing
like so he likes to be within this three of us
yeah
ya bubt it's easy for him to do that because he wasn't he's not one of the girls right he wasn't even close to her to begin with
yeah
yeah so he don't like
yeah
yeah yeah
then
ya then ya lah
so but then we
they know
they know how close I am with the other two
they I told you right they are going this weekend
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when I I said in the group I was busy you guys
no then then
then I'm like no ah don't let me be the deciding factor ah
mm ya true so
now now I'm just like okay go ahead lah
it's okay
then I say lah anyway
and I'm always used to be the odd one out so
if we go in odd numbers
I've been out with three people to and it sucked
ya
ya ya
and it really sucked
because every ride of course she would wanna go together with the other girl
uh I mean huh I don't mind
I don't mind I'm not
I enjoy lah but you must go with the right group of friends
so far the best experience I had was probably with Humaira and marissa
yeah I realised that uh I enjoy going out with
I enjoy just one more person don't need like a group
yeah
ya that's how I feel with the two guy friends lah I mean
other than the fact that they are two guys
I okay
yeah
I don't also what
ya you see like like Ria
like I just go with another person anyway that one no
that one
that one no choice
only the two of us
mm
it's okay lah
I mean yeah they go see they are going they are asking about the price haven't buy the ticket
sunday
yeah
yeah I know ah
so sad leh is
is because I recognise their faces so it
because they don't look they are not Singaporeans it's easy to tell what
no it's because I went there prominent lah
like
every weekend with different group of friends
during I think that one poly right
during my break
then I get the pass
err towards the end towards the end ya lah third year
okay lah uh
I sorry ah but ya lah that's the difference between you and me lah I enjoy pe
I enjoy all the ride now the rides that I used to be scared of is no longer scary for me
yeah
uh red one not blue
dangling I want to tho
hhmm
waste money sia go in take photo
ya lah the vintage car
oh yes
oh ya I remember eating that with Humaira
I remember you were pregnant lah last time when you go with me
crazy
I know
no it wasn't
it clearly stated no pregnant lady should be on this ride
that was early early part lah
yes you are right
crazy crazy woman
yeah you're crazy
it was a thirty second ride lah so
some kids are scared
there is the moment that thing drop what
do you even remember what you took I don't think you remember because you were just having fun
yeah I went with Marissa she was she was screaming her heads off
uh
I got somemore drawing to do
oh ya ya ya ya
ya ya cannot
what was her email ah
need to find her email
mm
ya
ya lah anyway
that's the thing I feel like she's not shy to speak to ask about
stuff also
yeah
she talked she talked about uh how
we were saying lah we know we know the process of how he met her right
so found her Instagram
and then
ya you know the nonsense
nonsense kind of
line lah I mean it's not even true he wasn't even there that's the funny part
so she replied and then they started talking
ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya he knows what he wants ah that kind
ya
that's right
yes
ya err also because he knows himself better lah learnt from mistakes
he will take action
huh
I think a bit lah he's not that bad
it's just that teenager angst you know
back then
ya ya ya whatever you call it
whatever you call it lah
but he changed for the better seriously he changed a lot
ya it's it's that kind of feeling lah
he's only what four right calm down
he's not even going to primary school yet then you will freak out
he will grow up because he meet
a lot of people he would learn how to do things on his own
suddenly you don't even hear him screaming mama anymore he will just mind his own business
mm
I think that's me
I think I share a lot of things happened in school or whatever to
I do that I do that just so she won't feel worried
that's my main objective not really because I want her to know what eh what's happening
no no no
now now as a mother do you think that is right
no right if you see your daughter or son
very quiet you don't know what's happening
I tell you already I don't know I you didn't
yeah yes definitely because I didn't even remember talking to you
you were
ya I feel like you were in your own world
you uh it's like I don't even talk to you I don't even know what's happening in your life
yeah
now now that you mentioned it just now right you got married when I was in sec one
so it sounds a bit funny
teenage ah
yeah but you already bloomed dah
some someone lah
yes
ya
really
oh my god you all nerds
and the teacher never react meh
mm
it's okay what you late but you still study well what
this is what eh
secondary school I very busy with my ah that's all I can say

even without O levels in your way
that is sad
crash landing on you
I do that but at home
yeah but well
seriously so sad no exam also you study very hard
okay lah good good for you lah
some people can do it
what in the world
I don't understand why you cry
oh my god I didn't know you were such a geek
you know you know when it was me in school when there's a surprise test
then I just look at my friends did you did you study no okay
then just do the test lah
I don't I mean
I learned halfway through in my life when I was in school
I learned not to put so much pressure on myself and some things I cannot control
what I mean
school's supposed to be fun don't have to cry over surprise test
I'm talking to you right now
yeah maybe when he's big enough like me next time you can story
yes of course
yeah
but in secondary school I think I was just busy with my and upper sec is my
until seven plus eight
until the
ya lah
it's okay A for effort
crazy
they never see ah I remember my friend
uh doing the practical right so at the back with the
drilling drilling machine it's called drilling what is it called I think so
but it's for acrylic right
she didn't tighten the acrylic properly and she on the drill
so the thing starting spinning so all the
chips flew out then cut cut cut cut cut cut her hand everywhere
and then I was just behind her and then I'm like
off the damn switch lah why are you like you know letting the thing keep on spinning
because she was shocked herself
then then I just
you know acrylic like plastic sharp sharp
cut cut cut cut
the sharp edges
yes
so I just went to the side and pull out the plug
and then my teacher come
you know teachers are usually supposed to be strict right
he just
he laughed he was like what in the world are you guys doing
the drill is nothing wrong it's just where the the the the holder where she put the acrylic she never tighten it properly
yes kiap the thing whatever you call it
but
workshop

orh
okay ah I mean
oh ya ya ya
um
wei then what what's your job as like advisor
ah
um
like the like exco member PERBAYU exco member need to have experience in like different ad hoc ya
so it's not not that bridging the gap kind of thing but more of like exposure for the exco member itself himself
ah
ya but
I don't know I mean you got say it's like a perks of
being exco member like
try
I mean I don't know
ya
oh
ah okay
but you sign up to be the
leader pe as in advisor leader pe
oh okay okay
ya but you have a choice to reject or accept pe
I mean
okay ah
um
oh I think it's clip though oh oh up up movie up
not really analyse lah but
um
ya I think okay macam like you need to incorporate your whatever theories that we learnt in class right just macam relate it to the movie
ya
is about err old people like elderly something like that ah
then
ya cause the the story is like
is is centered um centered on like this old guy pe ya so I guess that's how like my prof thinks that it is relevant
join ah
mm
oh ah ah ah
ah
so
so what's your what's your take on it
in the future but why is the future is now
mix
okay
okay
a lot of like
like on their especially in singapore like on their it will state
what race they are what
but it won't be like that what cause you only you only like
you only come out of your mum and dad
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
oh okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
err
like what's your point
uh huh
mm
like you say they shouldn't choose
oh
do you know that got some macam
ah
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
um probably indian cause
cause like
I mean okay I don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
then they need indian pe and then that their open slot is only indian like macam that open open macam the empty house is only open to indians
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for ah indian
ya
ah
probably the same race
a'ah a'ah
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to macam some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying ah so it's like
um
uh
um
ya
okay honestly maybe for me like I still support it but is just that I feel like um there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of ah like macam
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now ah
ah yes ah macam
ya so to a certain extent I guess like it's justified but did you know that macam this um
racial enclaves
ya
ya true lah true
ya and also macam there's a lot of like um
I mean this is what I learnt ah um
ah there's like two different kind of macam
considered private housing pe so they like they have um
actually not dorm more like rental rental places so like they can choose their roommates kind of thing then
like those big houses kan it's like that's the
yes
um
I think
condo
maybe condo okay I have a like macam a dream house that
is
but not but
eh
west okay
oh
okay
okay okay I think I
ah ah ah okay okay okay
ya
door
oh
mm

hi
hello how are you
okay okay
okay beauty in everyone
mm
uh huh
okay okay
uh definition of beauty eh okay
uh personally I think I don't have any good looks
what about you like what's your definition of beauty
mm
mm insecurities
mm
mm
uh huh
mm
mm
okay like for you do you think beauty
beauty in the long term would you ya would you for example would you friend someone who is okay because for beauty some people define it as good looks but then good looks to me uh I I see as a short term thing
ya ya ya
ya okay so my question is like do you think um
would you would you go for that beauty in the short term basis or a long term basis
um
okay
mmhmm
true true true
attention ya
mmhmm
um true true
ah
ah
mm
mmhmm
uh huh
mm like
true true true
okay uh
uh for my course okay because my course
they are very loud
ya they are very vocal lah then and they have good looks also so
ya fashion wise also ah

mm
mmhmm ya
ya
mm
ya true
um ya true
ten years down the road ya
mm true true
yes
competition
oh okay
mmhmm
oh ya
um okay
uh for working life eh
I think
it's subjective also because if you were to join in in the beauty industry then I think like good looks is the first ya like first priority that they will look into then followed by talent
to how willing is the person to work in my company
and then beauty is like
I don't know like I don't really place any priority in beauty
ya mmhmm
err yes yes
ya ya
mmhmm
mm
um
beauty in appearance or mindset personality wise
uh
okay like I think it's natural for humans to like
the first the first glance ya yes yes yes
err yes
okay so for me appearance or mindset in a partner
first time impression or
ah okay
mm
mmhmm
okay
uh I think will be mindset slash personality wise
uh okay okay
don't have good personality or mindset then
ya like what's the point of the marriage ya
um intelligence
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
err you groom yourself lah
mm
mmhmm
oh okay
mm
mm
if we if you were to put me in a room where there's a lot of like pretty pretty like girls and or or we we are we like the most most like insecure person lah
ya that
I hate
uh
mm
ya okay the
uh
okay no before
do you think girls or boys place more importance on the good looks
when making friends for the first time
mm
mm
subjective lah also
mm
mm
practical they're quite practical
is
uh ya
comparing ya mm
ya better
mm ya should we move on
mm
beauty standards is it
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
yes
mm suicide
oo
mm
mm
ya I think uh
err yes yes
uh yes
mmhmm yes
uh if there's a term
uh if I'm not wrong the term is dysfunctional um
ya dysfunctional um um ya so it's basically like the society is not
uh it's it's rather it's rather to have that society like even though the uh beauty standards or the socioeconomic status is not
so I think ya
yes yes any ya any competition also
ya yes yes yes
ya I'm not really sure what's the term lah but ya
mm
mm
ya ya
any any drive to move forward
true true
ya
mm
mmhmm

true
mm true
oprah winfrey err okay
mm

about
what's the what's the topic again
success okay
success also uh
ya I think in the if you want to be successful in the long term then it should be your skills your experience
other than beauty beauty as in beauty good looks then
uh no I don't think in the long term you be as successful as the one who have uh experience and skills
fashion
uh ya
mm

mm
okay err then our us okay about the fashion thingy right
uh

oh I know I know err if you want to go eh if you want to go far you go by yourself something like that ya
mm yes true
mm
mm
mm
rethink
okay so uh okay this might be out of topic but
you were mentioning about like um like okay it's not really related to what you said but I think there is some relevance but you um
they society sees one sees an individual who is always alone
as someone who is below below societies um
like being in a big group is deem as uh your offer value rather uh offer value and then for someone who is who is um
who is individual who is alone
uh seems uh society deems them as uh the weaks err yes the weak ones

oh
mmhmm
oh ya
mm
mm ya
yes yes

ya
so uh for me five years ten years down the road
uh my message to be um
to to emphasize to place the emphasis on your own life and and what you are you want to achieve in this world and the world after instead of looking what and not be influenced heavily by your surroundings so
it's really it's really what
your heart and your what what you really want lah instead of doing something that the the people around you
yourself and be more selfish like easy ya
mm
so ya
ellen degeneres
mm true true
mm
mm
mm
yes
ya okay then we shall end this recording here
alright thank you

ya got it already
technically
I complete four hundred hours lah around wednesday but I stretch over
I took half day half day
ah
ya alamak
mm two and a half months around there
ya ya I just need to complete four hundred hours
like was just getting into like the hang of it then after that like
kobe
I don't know
uh it's not project um it's just basically more case management
what I did lah for my previous job
we do lah same around the same lah it's more intense cause
err it's residential areas so it residential not institution lah
ah
I don't know if I want to say
okay lah
I don't know
the um from the office my my office there lah so
ah
so he decide and he he decided he wanted to try out I think corporate world so leave it be lah
ya
I think so
I think so not too sure
okay lah
but ya
finally somewhere I go is near my house
like at least at least ah fifty minutes travel
that's so sad
um not
I apply right then I turn up at the interview
then they ask me a lot of questions then it felt like an interview
ya
mm mm
ya ya no issues lah ya I think
I would say that she overrides him
ya ya I know
err oh last time
err the assistant director did this err blah blah blah and then she always say if I need help can come and ask ah then
um ya you can just give the money just collect the receipt and then log it in lah
ya
then I was like but the chat I thought the chat is also meant to be used internally
mm
I guess so good and bad lah
like what is it there's no bad impact lah on the client at the end of the day ah
like ya but
but at different locations ah under different program
mm mm
I think
in the social service ya
ah then it's also under so previously my previous job um they are the funders ya
so err
how to say
err fast and err presentable results
that's your
it's considered private affairs what uh
so in the end you have to get consent from them
they cannot
then
ya and then ya that's why
emotions and what happen during their period of time and usually christmas chinese new year spend with family right usually is like a big major events for them
ya
ya correct correct
ya
supposed to
supposed to ya
uh no no
um you have to record down ah
and I was like
I don't know I I think I'm not suited for at all
so it sounds a bit
like case management same thing but for youths so then ah
so then I ya so then I was like asking so what's the difference lah because last time like this kind of services still the same and
I mean it's duplicated in different services and then second of all is that it's just basically you asking the
uh people I think can't remember where
ah so I don't know lah what's going on
uh ya so
as as long as the place is position is empty lah
ya cause I just
uh like
I just like finished my practicum I just like submitted my last assignment
ya
and then in two weeks time I have like exams which I like I haven't even started studying
ya ya
no no no no it's okay it's okay uh
my line is very small I don't know if it's clear or not but I'm holding the the the the mic ya near to my mouth but sometimes I move lah
so cute
so maybe when I take a break from studying lah I start applying for a jobs
that's so sad
um

ya I did uh aiya
why
ya
um
that areas or like it's my area like which is far for you
um
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya good
like uh
uh
it's near to
ya it's near to tampines interchange actually
mm
I can send it to you but the the pictures are nice I think like I've
she goes to how's afiqah ah
ah
mm no
ah when was she married ah
ah eh
okay
ah okay okay
I
okay
you never met the guy is it
mm
mm mm okay ah nothing ah
eh is he our age
okay
okay now now where are they staying
ah
mm
mm mm
I think there might be some tension
ya
mm
ya ah ya
one person stay at home like you still need that double income somehow
ya
is uh
babysitters so
ya so
ya
ya
ya
I know
four months four months
mm
mm
you send the kid to play group lah then even then even then it's not full time you but not sure lah ya so do you want to work part time and then
I think ya

so basically um
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and err so err
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything lah about his life so
true enough lah he is a very uh forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an uh up point for him lah you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
changi airport
um
and that changi airport is what we thought it was lah to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it lah
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then um so now he is uh working at uh novena and he is there because uh he wants to do office work and rightfully so lah because he wants to uh spend more time lah with your family
uh and
since he has going to move towards
getting married uh he thought this the right step ah as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound lah in why he's doing it okay then he talk about um
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay ah this one ah oh every time I do as in ah like
was it so difficult to ah get this out
the mirror the mirror side
ah middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so ah what else um okay so I I
ah okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
ah that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
ah
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact uh do you have connect plan that's he look at me like uh what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years oh we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said lah ya ah six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and ah okay
that's why exactly that's why I say
ya lah but I don't know why they want that place lah anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
ah he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
correct ya
so um ya so that that part they understood lah you know what it's it's spilt milk ready lah kan like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
and then
that's why lah
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk zina whenever zina butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then err
ah revise plan ah ah correct
ah I also don't want to embarrass lah zina cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing zina session but no point lah the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
for zina to actually ah secure a job
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows lah that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working lah and you zena needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience zena hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for zina to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children ah then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
ah that one okay lah they bring about the halal thing lah so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya zina needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
you
grow up
grew up together
ashraf you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
and then
ah come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
ah then they say
okay for me I uh I feel that
so it's like if he lah in the sense that ah so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
then after the whole session also I told zina and even just now I texted saying that
so
of course lah
mmhmm
anyway I
so mm ya then I told him okay ashraf after all that's been said ah I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya lah I said you have
mm
then
um so basically that's it lah and then
at least it's it's clear lah that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
no he will just use
mm like
mm ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage lah
ya
so
ya
sister is working as a librarian but at changi
ya so it's was very easy lah then after when he left also I was telling lah see how easy and simple ashraf
was
by just being upfront
no zina you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
ya lah so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
ya so
like my ah that's why it was very simple lah because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that lah kan
so and he also can recognize lah the value in it and can recognise why you know zina needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that zina needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time zina would be the one taking care of it
ashraf ah because uh
someone needs to be there at home lah he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or zina's parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working lah and then I then I ask him so uh are you exploring the possibility of zina working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
um
okay lor then after then the
in the dining
uh
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear lah clear and upfront
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
for example
um
okay
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
huh
zina is receiving dayah is not there yet
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working ah ah
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
dayah at is at this stage of her life
mm
mm so we don't know that lah huh
basically this this guy ya
that's why
so oh anyway going back to zina I I told zina like
you need to sit down and you really need to uh
figure out the plan on how you gonna
plan it out
fair enough lah if he uh considered um
cause he then I say uh I
uh
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how ashraf is
I told her lah did you see or not what ashraf did
ya
that's why lah she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as oh
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
zina that is not easy-going
mm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going what
you are not um having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
mm
that's why during the
that's why ashraf
if
the way
ya lah of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent lah
I don't think he would lah if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
err
push zina right
pull
pull
ya
consume
step up
mm
so ya basically concludes the whole thing lah with
zina and ashraf then
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya dayah and me then ya I understand that you and dayah are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what hidayah is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
ah
huh
you lah ah then
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
I had the same kind of argument with me and izat I bet you ah you and dayah would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least ah you see ah it me and izat
I'm doubting you know whether you and dayah would apologise to each other
ya ya
that's why lah that's why it seems it's
ya lah
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
what the
like have to see it as steps lah
so
that I mean like
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
so okay lah I think
I can tell that me and izat even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
uh huh
that family comes first
that you need to see that
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya lah so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
we will make it happen
yes so I
and then
mama wah at one okay at one point
mm
nevermind just mm
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like um there was one point where um
then I said zina since when you are that close to izat then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to izat then I say rubbish lah
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
so that's why I told her ya zina you are close to izat because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to izat
izat is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct ah but I say you are close to the boys just because of uh
uh you are close to izat just because the boys uh with izat you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to izat
then I say since when you been talking to izat since when
all all the
you are that close to izat then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys kan
further studies
ah then I then I also
need this person the person ah to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what izat can do this job ah
ah then izat do you think then she's like smile ah aiya lah cannot lah
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
mm that's why
hmm
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward one really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
you know comfortable
ya of course

I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days ah like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and err the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so given that nowadays phones they uh they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me ah I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about oh no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about johor do you remember going to johor
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old johor house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old johor house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
mmhmm now the closest to johor we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there ah
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at uh pulau ubin what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so um what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
mmhmm
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to bugis like literally a five minute walk to bugis if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to bintan
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said oh we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like ah we're choosing to go to hong-kong oh why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so
talk to you another time relay ya oh what time you know
it's a colleague so ya
okay we should uh and our session ya it was nice talking to you poor
okay bye

well if I have
three wishes kan
um the firstly lah I
I would like to become a millionaire
oh ya sorry my last wish is that
I got a lot of friends who from all walks of life I can just um
okay how many options just ah one or two or three
not that good
meal eh
oh overseas okay I got one that I remember
whale meat when I go to japan
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
the taste is really unique lah
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best eh
to that extreme yes
ah
no the wagyu beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
a special kind of breed only for
ya
itaewon the itaewon actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain ah it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up err that hill
then after that if you go down
they are malaysians but the way they cook the bulgogi is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the bulgogi
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
cause I go it's actually
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal lah I I actually go down
nearest park then that's where all the snow is lah
very interesting
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
cause why for I mean for own
and wah I tell you the
okay in japan kan in a middle of
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of lah
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive lah but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
school lah cause err frankly speaking in asia right
really far kan
ah so that is the gist lah actually
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
hundred percent halal they won't accept err alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting kan that's what I when if you go around the world then you see lah
mm
correct correct correct is like that one
uh so they have the alcoholic
for them to to you know to do their things
ah so that is the gist lah
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy ah but again lah like
into youtube kan
ah yes cause garlic is very good lah basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy eh I
healthy
fruits lah I eat fruits lah but uh if you want it
okay ah usually fruits lah I just eat fruits
oh almost everyday is egg lah by right egg is is considered healthy food mah
skills eh meaning what
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code lah code very very well so that I can build
err games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
and that is your business product ah after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
uh one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
all
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause uh again ah
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again uh it's all about the skill set ah if we got
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food ah
just say food
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
goes very deep lah and also very err
they have very rich history uh their okinawan
karate-do aikido
if you're late for one minute eh they totally banned you from the class at all
tense your body means you have more strength but by right okinawa the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
realistic more relax and more
kata it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
to charge at the long distance
to fight the short distance
ah that's why when they have the any competitions
they do not know about okinawan the original one
they are trained not to use any weapons
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use uh a weapon to fight
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really ah do research on it
sorry again
was free
err
yes of course healthcare
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this err
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
I mean that is the realistic view lah but if like you say you ask me again
humans no longer
oh
oh
okay ah
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
mm
everything
so most likely will
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
go to mars maybe go to venus
ah cause I think that is the way to go lah you just want to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
activity eh
meaning what ah
hmm ah eight hours eh
activity eh activity
activity
eight hours eh
wah
no no no is working out
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight eh I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
karma
ya
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke lah if a comical joke easy ah double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause err my life how to say ah
it's a pretty boring lah
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya lah
actor eh err
okay ah actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
um he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one ah also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like err
what troy that
trojan war troy
between this ah
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
that cannot be killed uh then after that
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
ah orh even beyond that um you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that eh
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male ah character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this ah characters also this achilles
uh his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya lah and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used um can really
make if you really into this ah like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful lah I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
ya that's the gist
oh how I keep ah I don't know leh
actually I just went through life ah
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that um
after I read a book for half an hour
all these uh youtube lah especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it lah
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read one
I don't like I would
pictures and of course obviously the videos lah I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right err I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something ah err you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist ah
seventeen years old eh
seventeen years
old self
ah
seventeen
need to know ah you need to give me a time period
seventeen
oh poly eh
err
advice
I don't truthfully ah I don't regret anything
advice eh okay the best thing is
ah
ah actually frankly speaking eh at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago ah and actually
ah if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
even for those like you imagine ah
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
err
things in life yet
your character back then when you
uh
so my character when I was only
that kind of thing so just live life lah
just a live my life that's all lah mm
where do I see myself eh
in five years' time eh okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same ah as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married lah so usually is you do like that
actually
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge
of everything that I'm learning business especially uh
money making invention business so basically is
the coding lah hopefully in a five years' time right the technology that will come out in five years' time which is maybe
a a new youtube or a new facebook
I'll be the one who invent it or who create it wah then I'll be woo
ten years
for houses they say lease ninety nine years

okay
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but I mean come on ah
I rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what I mean
because
I'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
so I say that to him lah
mm
so they were looking for people to debate lah like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
ah I'm not sure whether per debate or what because I mean I love to debate what
so uh
err I
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
you know what I mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
mm
seriously ah
okay
okay we don't talk about lah eh
is err
that's yes correct that's the main reason why I left
uh huh
ah right
that's the thing ah
even
but government allow sport activity what
ah
so I call this guy he's known for speaking ah good malay
uh to mix we always mix
ah
a'ah it's very standard ah
err okay so three wishes
I would wish
to have err
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay lah let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
oh my god
you know what
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
mm ah okay okay
so
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
something like that
ah alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my err future lah
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
ah be a professional sports player
okay
uh huh
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer lah cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
err but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
ah so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money lah
ah
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific lah but
Singapore soccer is a no no lah
all macam haziq
ah that's a bit unrealistic the passion is uh actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of err
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life lah
ah
alright
sorry
ah true true Malaysia pay better
um
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower ah
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport ah
anywhere and everywhere
wah so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late lah I don't want to be late lah
ya so for example ah
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
mm
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching ah
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about lah
ah
it is an emotional story
um sad
but
no it's a series series
mm but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
hmm
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
oh
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class ah in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well err in primary school
ah because
um
how to say eh
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no lah I mean that that's the problem ah because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have err you know
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
ah play soccer at the void deck all lah so
I will change my mindset lah but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this ah cliche phrase
it's true ah what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example ah that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like wah
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song ah kan maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
ah
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders ah basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start eh you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song ah
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because ah there was this video playing that song ah so like oh not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K ah I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
you know but I'm like oh ya eh nice song nice song ah
so it's damn annoying ah actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the lah
okay lah okay lah we cannot throw shades lah okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
mm
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
um
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries ah will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
mm
ya
precisely
mm mm mm
that's a sensitive uh topic
okay
let's see next question eh
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do mm very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds lah
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
um rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need ah okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and ah okay basically iphone is good lah those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
um shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at pasar malam
and then
shoe uh twenty thousand lah
you know ah Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
ah bought a very expensive car lah
uh so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like eh you know this this and this bought this and this I'm like oh okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money lah
you want to show off
and all
give me their money lah I can put to better use
okay oh yes sorry
mm
uh
but people just live to complicate it
ah
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face lah
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do lah right
alright next question
oh this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours oh my god
oh my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
yeah
ya so like
like they say ah everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different lah
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
so I'm like eh so there's now two shops eh
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food lah outside food the look is so important
mm mm
and
mm
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got ah
hopefully
oh you know what I just want to come lah
um next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
err oh okay okay oh okay okay
okay hmm
oh okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone eh sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
mm
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
some people just the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face ah
okay I wouldn't say expert because
err I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right lah
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on lah it was like what blonde
then I was like
ah see ah this one ah
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in
you have to admit ah
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
ah the
eh don't do this lah
you know what I mean you are like come on lah you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but kena our
you wanna get expelled is it
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
no comments
um okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
um
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
um
can ah but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is err
skill eh
maths
ah I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths ah maths ah like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of uh discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me ah
ah
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
mm
mm mm
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
yes
okay
it's good lah they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
alamak cannot search ah
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning lah
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events oh basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny lah okay we skip class
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding ah a serious scolding ah
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
ah
I mean
it's hard lah it's hard
yeah
damn but
oh my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss lah definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it lah eh let's not throw shade to people lah eh
but oh my god I miss our class with
uh ham boy
S&W
uh
you only spend time when ah
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you lah
like that we really sit down and talk
ah
ah yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was ah
ah
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time lah
ah
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
um graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or correct
so okay lah
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
err
ya okay then you have to go to okay
then from where's where's the next destination
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
you know what I mean
but
ah
and I have better options ah I have better prospect so
if I'm gonna go this way
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do ah to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
because I hated every moment of
one week then I didn't come for another one week
you know what I mean
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that what you know what I mean
like giving
so
true lah true
yeah
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free ah
cause I'm laying low a bit
ah I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things lah in the future
mm so you can actually come down
three more right
mm
alright alright I I will look forward I will look forward then will be here for
huh
fifteen minutes fifteen ah serious expressway
mm mm mm mm mm in Singapore you wanna rev come on lah
you throttle abit beep
kena fine
okay
let's see
okay okay okay
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
um
let me think ah
it it seems good right
oh
I wanted to
like you know my friend buy then I get the free one lah
what happened
oh your wifi seems abit bad lah eh
okay lah I think we go next question ah it's a good question
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
okay we we apply it to ourselves lah ah not to other people lah
what would you rather have
yes
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that lah this I guess this my fate lah
so if
in the past yeah fit body now ah
whatever god give me I'll take lah
like uh whatever it is lah good looks fit body
but now I'm going to so I guess I have to choose fit body again lah
like know because
ah but oh my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body lah like
we don't need upper body strength
you don't pass don't shoot eh
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying lah because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
if you look at the oppunent team eh
the best is usually the fastest
ah but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst ah offensively
ah
so
but I have to keep up with those uh because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not um
used to it ah like I'm not exposed to it what
ah
mm mm mm mm yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
for me
for the rest of my life bro
frugal eh
the one near the bus stop to go to
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house lah because free what
right
oh chicken rice for the win bro
funny ah you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore chey
oh I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
chicken
beef
ah
kampung chicken they make sure it's from a
not say kampung lah but you know kampung means they bring it up naturally
ah it it it you don't have to worry about the
others lah
uh
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival what the basic survival need
eh
O K S I
okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe ah I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya wah I mean
true lah true
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
uh system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict ah
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
ah
correct
mmhmm
um
wah
yeah
you know what okay
no very simple
then we open
um
like uh
only for pioneer generation lah
why not
yeah
correct or not if the old people are not a tech savvy enough okay they go
ah
must use the ah reservation booking
yeah
uh whether they have space or not and but come on ah
the
this is the problem right find solution lah
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who ah
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is lah ah
so we just have to take care of ourselves lah that's why you know ah like
honestly this phase two open my eyes a lot ah like
actually we don't have to go out always
ah but that is different thing but you know to go out every single day
you go out transport money
food money
shopping money
money money money
everything is money bro you wanna go here to here okay lah you never eat outside you bring food from home food food from home also cost money
you got out take transport also money
ah
correct
ah
ya because K want to lepak okay but
not outside you know what I mean like that's why I always invite you to come my house
ah
it is prone to have problems
like my neighbourhood is very peaceful so okay lah
nothing much
ah
no
mmhmm
seriously
then later when the number of cases spike then everyone panic so
no comments lah this kind of thing is very
just let let
let it be lah eh
we don't have much say but
okay lah I mean we'll just don't be those kind of people lah
but
ah
I don't appreciate it
seriously firework is overrated for me
like
okay
I could just create this using my computer
you know what I mean
but I it it's just me lah I don't appreciate it lah I appreciate doing I'm all for doing kind of than seeing kind of guy
like you bring me to the most beautiful country with the best place to sightsee I would appreciate
like you bring me to a country with the best theme park I would go
ah
correct correct
okay that's different lah that's different lah bali nah
nah
but normal normal asia bro it's europe
or south america bro
okay lah if you talk realistically ah you want to go to europe also you have to go to the europe safe country lah Turkey
ya
they they handled the situation quite well
based on what I heard lah because you see ah like
U ah they are very big hit
ah so it's quite worrisome to go there ah
mm
greenland
no
mm mm mm mm
is it greenland or iceland ah that has no army
don't have army yeah one one one of this wait also one of this country don't have mosquito
I think it's greenland
because you see ah it's so err
precisely greenland got ice iceland is green
legit ah
oh oh oh oh oh
oh okay
mm
mm why
I don't know why didn't you apply for it
but it is still available ah still available lah
go for it bro go for it bro
in times of crisis we need
if you can get if you need help we have to
get whatever we can lah
but don't beg
yeah
ah yes yes yes
I off all the light

thirty percent of your overall behaviour like thirty percent is from your your behaviour
um
elementary business analytics and cyber security and and life skill is like type A module so we don't take exam for that we just take like uh
tests we take tests we take uh we do assignments we do uh
like stuck class task group task all and then that is our like final grade lah like our participation you know
like tasks and assignments in the class all and then for
um
how we are supposed to like treat the customer then how like we supposed to like analyse data then make like
uh like
ah I talk about like first
ah seek first to understand than to be understood is that kind of stuff is like things you learn through life lah
then then but we have two other modules which is business rewriting and early childhood ah that one is a type B module so we must do assignments like we do everything that we we do the same thing as like what we did in like
um
and
what's the thing
and
life skill but then like this one we have exams so we have like chapters to learn and all so our my first exam is like fourteen september and which is exam and then second exam is sixteen september so you only have two exams then after that we can go for our break
somehow we can go for our break then like they will release the result online then you look at your result online jer lah but then it's very complicated because like
uh what kind of mental disorder what kind of like
uh mental uh mental disabilities is
a lot to that
and then
um minutes of meeting notice of meeting taking like notes when you have meetings is
a lot of writing like one you have
in exam paper you have comprehension
section each comprehension and then you have letter email notice of meeting
and then ah like another one is what ya I forgot but there's another component and then you only have one hour thirty minute so you must like
very very fast like really fast
but then like there is a lot of content
so like multiple choice just do it just like pass through that get average thing
lowest mark should be like
twenty
hard part but then like
we are looking forward like err after finishing exam right
we forget that sometimes it is still we're not ending our first year in december then we are ending our first year like next year april because started in april then now it's just first semester and then sometimes like when we think about it we are like
we have been this school for like so long we have been like in the first semester for so long like we do so much project we did like what five project work and so many
damn tiring
it's very tiring and I do not
really want to like
continue continue like this for a long period of time I just want to like two weeks break and just like go to sleep
like really let's like spend the day like sleeping I didn't even want to go out I want go out but
so it's just but I just want to sleep
cause like now even now they are preparing us for like poly life they asking us what poly you want to go and I'm just like oh my god we just stay in the first semester why ah why you thinking about poly but then like we have to think about poly cause ultimately some of them don't want to continue this course like you can tell
mm
mm
I think like
I think we're in also same I find it hard working in teams honestly cause like I'm the type that I like to
uh
mm
the classmate cause we have a group like forty people
uh
quite a large number of people in one class forty forty one
and then secondly is
uh
how you
well you work with people and thirdly is like
the different opinions that people have because you are going to be somehow like you my course you are going to
be a teacher you have to work with a lot of different people in the area people cannot speak english people that cannot speak
like
people they want people can only speak chinese then people that can like
how you
but then I find it very like
even
like
it's better if you can finish earlier kan in a sense but then
perfectionist like on
point and he has differing thoughts from mine
like where we stand lah
because he is the type of person that think very like
oh he doesn't think outside the box often
he thinks like inside a box like shoot my rules person then I'm not that kind that kind of person somehow I'm the type that I like to talk about it then like I think other ways
is that kind of thing
but then like it's very hard because like
like because you can't I think you're other classmates don't do it you're gonna get A you want get high marks just because you did it but in my class is very competitive they're not stupid people you know they are really not stupid people like
there are people who score like eighteen
then after that
some people come into our class thinking that come to thinking that okay this is going to be easy right cause gives a lot of the scholarships
scholarships and more lah a lot of like opportunities for students
our class is my class it's very competitive like
like a lot of the things we learn like more like less
even that for even for me that is very hard cause like to adapt
to being in like uh
like secondary school
but
at the end I produce like good results but then now like
it will be like very like easy right
I'm like then my friend is from early childhood poly then she is like
uh
guidelines for how certain age you're supposed to like talk by what age you are supposed to talk by what age you need to walk then that kind of stuff but we have to memorize that kind of stuff then we talk about the brain like temporal frontal lobe
the parietal lobe then I'm just like oh okay then was like in unit what unit six that we learn about that kind of stuff and then when I look back I'm just like
oh my god
same things as like a normal teacher do like all all is linked somehow then it becomes like
when you realise that how hard
that this is gonna be right cause from the
damn
this is gonna be hard and then ah I'm like I'm not even in poly that's the thing
not a lot of paths for you to go
you know that
or you want to sign contract with and just work for a few months
uh for a few years and like
cause that's what I want to learn what since my points didn't get me to achieve that but then now that I have the opportunity kan I just want to go for like child psychology
I don't know somehow like girls are better at planning their paths
like I is no shade to guys there's not shade but we think about the future a lot which is like overthinking lah we think about the future a lot but like okay is this gonna be like
a smooth journey what am I going to do next like the thing won't even come don't even bother and I'm thinking about uni I know that I want to go to
cause it's a very even on twitter you are like ah you guys look down on but then like you must experience that cause it's fun it's really like fun it's like secondary school but upgrade
cause now people are more mature so like less drama and just small fun and then you get along with everybody everybody is like
you know it's very fun but then like obviously now
cause first of all we never when teacher first cause when you first enter kan
what do you want what is your achieve what do you want to achieve
and where is your next step that is what
they asked and like we go around the room
so like we already we all have our own end goal this is where we stop that kind of stuff
when you go uni you fighting with secure spot obviously they are clever people then you fighting if with poly which is clever people you don't know who yet there is no saying that is not clever but we are slower in learning pace
that kind of stuff I think
I I realise at certain point if is this hard
that is the shock and then I think
go to poly after
it's gonna be hard in poly cause poly is more like tough
then we just one person do then everybody speak out like now my group has become like usually we it's a group work but now it's like I do the slide and I just separate the part
language I am okay with it but I'm more to english in a sense cause
in early childhood if you get at least a
if you get C five right you have to retake
like ego is what
good thing about I don't want to say good thing about COVID it but the great thing about online learning is you record a lot or your lecture
then but I still there was assignment given at the end of your lesson then I was like
okay now I have to do assignment but I didn't learn anything cause I uh sleeping
it's a good day but then it's like
eighteen it's not such a young age but it's not such a old age either it's in the middle there at least eh there are people that want to get married you know marriage is like ugh
older and more responsibility in a sense
and then ah one of
at eighteen you find out a lot about yourself
what kind of person you are yourself discovery journey is eighteen what kind of person you are what
who is your real friends who is your friends and who is just your acquaintance these three groups of people
and then she say then you realise are you a relationship person or are you not
like how are you coping with your relationship it cause like
I would choose studies lah if a guy said I want you to stay home when you get wraps up
no I'm not marrying you uh I want to like I want to have like education I want to work I want to travel the world
she
don't cause she wants she said after she graduated ah she want to take one year break
just
she want to take one year break then I'm like that's a long time bro one year of your life what you gonna do but then I also respect
cause taking a break is something that
NAFA is poly after she finish NAFA she graduate
she can work she is basically a college
kan
you know you can join us you know cause you know what megan me and aqil are going there for
err early childhood cause their programme that early childhood is very strong and then megan is going there for science like food science I think you can go there then we can all get a
apartment stay together it's gonna be so much fun but hada don't want to go
studying a lot
she more prioritise experience and I kind of understand that
mm
there's no right or wrong
in a sense there's no right or wrong but it's just that there's people more like
you don't want them who struggle in a sense
ya I feel
mmhmm it's like
there's no such thing as no free no care like to me in singapore right your education really somehow determine
that's that's total like
ya that's total like a lie like we all know it determines who we are as a I'm always like every
year right at the end of every year right
I can understand why they put pressure cause we talk
like like
plans like of like timeline I have a timeline of my life what I want to accomplish like I don't have my dad already set by twenty five then can bring back home guy
bring back home you don't get married you know bring back home guy so I have like ugh and then now what another like
nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
seven years to find my one but then like I don't focus on that
like cause now
yes
the crying no non-stop
that kind of thing
the cry non-stop right then but then
to me I don't know in a sense right
like okay I want
a boyfriend but then
somehow
when I realise can
like how to say ah
I'll be like you focus on your life I focus on my life
we'll see where it goes lah
I mean like
even with my ex I didn't know you know despite all the off and ons right we dated for like what
two years two years and half like that's a long time
like that's a pretty long time lah but then like then you realise at the end already right
how I am
you have a lot of happiness in you
because my friends say you number one when you break up eh
like that's not good
it's but ah then you get get okay can be there then you just like I'm fine I'm the greatest person then you
spend that that days like okay I'm actually that good and you focus on yourself
that's what I've been doing for the past like two years I think I beat up a lot of myself I'm like the
like I think this year
changed me a lot
somehow COVID kan
I now I know like who I want to be friends with
like during this period of time now I know who I want to be close with like I have you I have like the other girls I have like even raziq sometime although he's gone most of the time I try to understand cause you never know what's going in a
person's life like there is a lot of things that
I would say that the start the twenty twenty the start of twenty twenty january imelda is different from
september imelda now in the sense cause I'm more like
okay because I feel like I've been like living my life
you know that kind of thing
we talk a lot less spend then second most is like with the girls the other girls then third is raziq
like I is mostly because I spend a lot of time with family and that's the best thing you know cause they can
appreciates family time a lot like he really loves I think when I was in sec actually ah I hangout a lot with my friends like sec four I can talk a lot with them
then I realise like how
checks up on our like
uh she checks up on like our locations
then she check up on our like
uh
like with with her phone she can switch off our phone like time in time out but then like
then my brother my brother would ask a lot of question
but then we will give and she just download it and she just install it we didn't even know
I don't ever feel personally I don't feel angry
in a sense lah
cause
ah
we just like uh
cause
but ah same to me ah
mm cause is I think my family is like that you know then you know the one good thing is we don't hide anything from each other
naturally when I had boyfriend I tell my mum and my dad actually they don't
that kind of stuff cause the guys that I date tie me down

eh babe

ah ah lah

okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap eh
the first one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
to eat
then I'm like huh
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
it depends ah maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
mee goreng but you know me and mee goreng
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that mee goreng taste
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not lah
which I don't think it is
this is actually konjac jelly konjac you know C O N J A C
ah have you tried mala before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of mala cause actually I I went to hai di lao we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to hai di lao and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all lah
uh because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try mala they so bad you know like you have to try mala I was like what this this this big deal about mala sia everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too kaw
you know kaw
yes
like too strong like that
uh
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil lah
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you ah
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K nah
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
ya err okay K ya ya uh it so it's konjac jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this mala taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious eh
you think the conversation is good
like
mm
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets ah the other two is for my other friend
so I brought it home first
uh uh
you can just throw it away
because
stingy ah
mm
mmhmm

I'm like literally sitting down waiting to go to work then in the end I went to work late plus I was watching this
I don't know
oh eh when is your exams ah
mm how is school
what do you mean by normal
eh speaking of which
actually I have school sorry if I'm like cutting you off
I know I'm like a tricksy
I'm just going to take you out ah
K I have a diploma in mass comm
degree in business marketing
in building drafting which is architecture
so I'm like
one thing to the other to the other
and then now I was thinking
about psychology a lot lately because initially I wanted to take that but
it wasn't safe lah but like now lately with all the mental stress
diploma in psychology and
ya I don't know lah I was just thinking a lot about it ah I don't uh it's been about two months already
why do you feel like certain way
at a certain time
um
more of a selfish thing I want to know about myself not only that
but I want to
I want to know why people react in a way ah
because I see people change and I see
like
like after a while you be like eh a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID
mm everyone is so wary dodgy now
sus yes sus
sus suspicions
what do you think what should I
err ya
ya have to really think about it ya cause you invest in time as well
mm
ya no no because the thing is because of this whole economic downturn
K yes I was in exhibition line
K it's getting a bit too personal already
I thought of like changing
changing the career line lah
changing the career and instead of
this whole cause the whole of uh the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it lah
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm of course ah but I'm just thinking like
it's more of a personal thing to be to be honest it's more of a personal I want to know why people act such way and
not only people but myself also lah
mmhmm
no like just diploma first
of course
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
because if you are talking about money yes I'm I have the job base
it's paying okay
just okay
and plus I can always pay pay installment yes malay people like installment

but no no uh of course obviously it's like school fees you pay installment what so
not that I don't want to move back with you guys but I'm so comfortable staying alone

I have travel all across europe not all across lah like maybe the western eh no eastern side of europe I remember it cheaper
like above
what was that the
the know not not not not not I won't said poor lah but that ya ya the eastern side of europe we should have a poor countries of europe everything there is cheaper right above france
ya not in france itself but ya the it is uh ya eastern side of europe
things are cheaper there

everyone muslim is following him ah
so everyone muslim is doing the stock then I was like eh this whole stock is not really halal you know
but anyway so I'm just going to see how it goes
ah ya speaking of which um hobby yes
sewing I thought of getting a sewing machine
like soon
I actually plan to go down to gain or like gain city or challenger
I want to start stitching my own clothes

eh you know what I can incorporate you know why cause I was actually thinking of you know
um okay I saw that fashion show where they were doing like
those headpieces
with those beads pearls laces
I was actually thinking of incorporating that
into making a mask
you know the face mask that we are wearing
cause like everyone's wearing a normal
normal mask the most fanciest one is they buy from like
carousell whatever
uh ya very lame and cheap and always the same design
I thought of creating something that is like stand out
yes with beads lace
and then maybe can incorporate your methodology
or like earring whatever not not really earring lah but like maybe like some
metal pieces that you can stick you saw raja
the one the mouthpiece that raja wore the
that cover the whole face but leave out the eyes like catwoman like that kan cool kan
uh ya I thought of doing that

like oh I want to hug I say you better get away I will smack you then you know

this year how it really change eh
mm
ya next year should
come my friend is sell trying to sell me something
some E commerce thing
really right like it feels like yesterday but it's actually a long time ago it's actually
know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
no not twenty twenty is really slow walk ah but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location ah in the end we loved it ah
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop ah
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like um sya was
that's why a lot of things happened
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three people start queuing already
ya which is
too far they were cordoned off already
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
so I went down at about
ten no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten I was like eh the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like oh shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like huh
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
and it costs five hundred I thought I told you before
mm
it costs five hundred so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
carpet eh seriously I need to change this carpet
mmhmm
see
alhamdulillah
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity
yes manifestation of positivity and who pushed you
who went around
excuse me he died a long time ago
ya he did what
exactly a long time ago what
yes samled
mister samled
he passed away he's a good boy
codeswitching
like towards the end I never expected eh
ya
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
he's been forever kan
since you were like four or five
ya four or five ah
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain orh
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during
remember
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
or like walk around and do my work here or like
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
everyone needs the money
but
seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
mmhmm
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
mmhmm
uh huh
shouldn't be that expensive what to entice people to buy what or like rent
downgrade
decrease
mmhmm
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small lah
a false wall
then like I'm like huh
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this ah
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like oh I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like ah okay no way
but it's costly lah
it's nice sia it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all kan with the window
oh ya speaking of which just now I pass by uh river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like oh my god I really miss that place
I really miss that place
huh I miss the outside I was like walking through the whole thing
ah that
I love the outside I hated my room
it's like porter room so small
river valley
wait where you which one you talking about
potong pasir
no
potong pasir yes
potong pasir I love the room because it was an upgrade
they clean once in a while it was nice
the room is nonsense but the hall is huge and I'll always sleep slept at the hall
yes
hmm
huh when
she cook curry
mm
huh then where was I
oh interesting
exactly exactly plus the hall was already so huge
so the windows made it look huger
look bigger huger you know make it look
bigger
ya if only the rent there is cheap
yes it's considerably expensive ya of course for myself
no no no no no no no no no rent a proper room this uh this time round lah but it's still expensive now is too expensive
it's like almost two thousand dollars
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like uh
eh no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
mm
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right

okay can
oh serious
okay lah then tell mama cannot lah if she want then can go to sentosa or something
that will be nice ah
ah
the laser tag thingy right
ya coming into december then my parents think about renovation for their house and the renovation is a little bit of a nightmare
not because of the tau but because of the house itself you want me tell you the story
no it's not haunted

okay lah some aeroplane food is nice
qatar flight food is quite shiok
right so like when the flight come like the flight to singapore come so only those who are from that island be at the airport cause to okay lah then the singaporeans can go to that island then it helps their economy it sustained from also

the err primary school
I don't know I don't keep track also err too confusing the kid is at primary four or primary five I think
actually I don't ah I don't join teaching because I don't want to be under also
that's why I do adjunct
ya the stress I think my friends you know in teaching career okay lah actually the the reason why I don't join teaching is because I want my holidays lah
no I want my holidays during off peak period
mm
kindergarten
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours one also
ya
yes last resort mm
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment kan so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing lah but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
mm
oh maybe I just don't handle stress well
ah like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second one so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that one I you know lah
they have been trained
ya amazing

the world of the marriage
ya I did but I watched halfway only
cause so draggy so boring
I feel like they could have just settled it within like the first five episodes but they drag it all the way
no lah I watched until the end lah eh no I watched until almost the end
but I think I stopped like
I've got like three episodes to go I think
why
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya lah like draggy right
ya ya the new wife also psycho
so that's why I only watch I skip until the last episode then I saw the last episode
the new wife left the husband right
ya lah because she fell for the psychiatrist right
she fell for the psychiatrist right the colleague
I I think the guy like her that's quite obvious what
uh huh
oh is it
mm
oh is it I didn't see that part though I think that's where I skip
mmhmm
I feel like they could have finished in ten episodes
because it's so draggy
ya
the what they ask for is system set the standard ah the standard ya no the standard lah because like if you see
on average most of the dramas are sixty episodes what
locked can you please lock the door
like the story line lah
ya ya I got bored I didn't even want to finish it
ya I still prefer the old dramas like what I'm re-watching the princess hours
did you put that
no I watched there's a few versions right
I think I watched the nineteen ninety seven eh
ya I don't know ah that one also I never finish
it's very rare for me to actually finish a drama I get I get easily bored
no I'm not it's not about being busy it's I just
no I will like I tend to switch over very often
ya but I keep re-watching like
I don't know I find comfort in watching old drama that I've like watched a thousand times before
ya full house also remember
the rain rain right the actor
that was good
mmhmm
ya the other day right I went to the clinic at choa chu kang
but then at the same time because the doctor was very nice so I ask him lah like if he deal with
which contains like vitamin A or something ah I forgot what he said current sixty plus
but then the thing is I googled right website they handle err severe cases
mmhmm cystic acne
oh that one I don't know
ya
so they referred her
but how's the payment like ah I'm on I'm on tight budget seh
but they they only accept cash ah they don't accept like medicine or what
ya but but you don't
you should
you should wash you should use Cetaphil
the exfoliator
why
ya
but this one also is because
of last weekend
cause I didn't hydrate myself after drinking
is this one is cystic acne then after that it exploded but the ones on my forehead it didn't
ya lah
but I also but it's because of period
but my forehead I really don't know
then
then you want me to get married to fix this
ya because your hormones balance off what

three pointer

self drop out self claim drop out
ya
half a year I thought that I dropped out you know until like half a year later I talk to him about it then he say ee no that you didn't
ya I thought I dropped out
cause the the way the my mentor said to me was
like you don't have to come anymore I was like as if I dropped out ah but he she didn't tell me that my dad called them to just pull me out of the course
whatever lah
mummy but it's okay I have no regrets honestly

clap ah
okay start
is our first time sia I quite nervous I'm so nervous
okay okay I think your phone needs to be nearer ya okay err just now we had our chinese lesson
so um like coffee bean was so packed ya so but no choice lah we really tried to find a place kan ya but I was also very sleepy ya so what do you do in the err sungei buloh
how many friends did you go with
is it the the malaysian guy that you told me about before
oh
then you all didn't decide to grab lunch or something
oh
oh what did you buy
he was he was singing then I was like wah in my heart eh is like like bursting tau ya so I was so happy to see him singing and like being very cheerful cause like I told you that time err he was a bit down and like err demotivated kan
so when I like I heard him singing then wah like I was like thanking the god like don't know how many god okay I mean I only worship one god but ya I was like oh my god I was so happy that he was happy then he started walking also like I told you he hasn't gone out of bed for like I think at least one week ah ya so today was the first time that he walked and he was walking in front of me also
your face ya so ya lah so they were encouraging him to sing more lah cause they were happy that he's happy then err he even he was like err cause one of the nurses one of the male nurses is called his name is rex he's a filipino guy
so he was like rex I'm going to dedicate this song to you and like all the nurses in this ward for taking care of me and then he was singing the all of me song ya ya john legend I cannot remember ah all these names ya so ya lah so they were they were like some of them were singing with him also like while they were doing um I think doing his blood test and all that
ya so like I think I think as a nurse also if I were if I were the nurse also I'll be super happy like this patient like in a way found their motivation
ya
okay I'm done
err what did I have for lunch ah oh ya because I was talking to haziq until so long right my breakfast end up became becoming lunch ya so I ate my nuggets and fries at around like one eh eh no ya around one eh no
no no twelve twelve sorry
ya I that's my comfort food
mm true I agree the ya those two dollar chicken rice two dollars nasi lemak at those are it's like a god send
ya correct even though it doesn't come with soup or like doesn't come with I don't know like err but the portion is decent ya the portion is decent then err the taste also not that bad ya so ya I I've been eating there quite a few times also
oh ya ya no no sorry I digressed and now I'm talking about um just in general me eating there because I love that place now ya choa chu kang
ya is near the the the the old school bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop that's only like one dollar plus only
ya ya ya but anyway ya that was in general I love that place ya but if you wanna ask me about lunch what did I eat for lunch yesterday let me think no I didn't oh okay I remember I went to oh cause I okay yesterday I was supposed to work full day but I took half day ya so in the morning I was working
ya okay so anyway ya I wanted to try the burger king you know why cause there's a new snow cheese snow cheese burger
it was surprisingly better than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a fail because you know usually like cheesy stuff like I mean other than cheese fries a lot of the cheesy stuff usually they fail cause like um it's not enough cheese or like the cheese is like fake cheese or something but this one is like they really use I think is mozzarella cheese cause when I bite into the burger right the cheese actually pulls
ya and I have no idea how they make it lah so like like how they can like make it in a way so cheap cause mozzarella is not that cheap ya then ya it was good then after that I went to gym then after that I went home to shower because the gym in choa chu kang doesn't have a shower
later like what time
err the burger err I ordered the meal then I added forty cents for what ah I added forty cents for onion rings so it was I think a normal burger meal is eight dollar ninety cent
ya so are you thinking of getting one tomorrow
ya
ya nice but I think right after trying the mozzarella eh no the snow cheese burger I kind of still prefer the swiss mushroom eh the mushroom swiss burger cause it's saltier and I love salty food
ya don't know ah it's just like I I like it that way ah
ya then what did you do in the evening yesterday do you still stay in
oh
where
mm
mushroom soup how can mushroom soup be salty
what as in like is too clumpy
oh okay okay okay
oh
oh okay wait what is this cafe called again
is it is it like the
but is it like in a mall or is it like in the middle of nowhere
oh wow that's interesting um so why did you guys want to go there
mm oh ya since your friend has a car right so what did your friend order then
oh and that's enough for him
mm
mm oh ya I saw your friend before he's like a teddy bear
mm
then after that you all didn't go for dessert or anything
I think so ya oh I didn't know there was a drive through there
you and your mocha
mm mcdonald's drinks are always sweet
mm that's nice so so he pick you up from
aww that's nice
ya yesterday I just went to the hospital oh like after I gym then I went home to shower then after that I was feeling pretty lazy lah honestly so I just err ask my brother ah eh can I take the car or not then he say can go and take ya then I took the car I drive to I drove to
so I was super scared about that so like err when I reach there right it was quite empty like quite a few cars parked there lah to be honest so like I was not too worried but then to be safe kan I just parked right smack in front of the lift
nasi ah sorry I ate the lor mai kai then I ate the then I order three siew mai
ya it's damn nice right for some reason that lor mai kai got the like the wok hey taste ya oh my god ya so that's why like wah I think if I go there again right I'm just gonna keep buying the lor mai kai
I didn't see anything at the ulu car park ah parking lot exactly so ya some more hospital kan ya so I was super scared then I just like okay never mind don't think about it
okay let me let me look at the other prompts
eh
I hope that we can play badminton later seh
ya
ya too windy I think too much but I think
so that err they all evaporate faster something like that lah I have no idea how the science works ah ya okay let me see what are the prompts um
okay if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
damn ya that's super deep I I didn't expect you to think of that
ya you know mine on is like super shallow
damn what who who is that celebrity
oh
ya that's true
that is a very is hyorin right that is a very response is like a very well formulated kind of answer ya
ya
mm
oh damn
sounds very black mirror kind of
in what way can he help others
damn you say is the boy is it how oh chey
I was expecting like you know like a seven year old boy oh
damn
it's like it's like robin hood in a way
robin hood I mean takes money from the rich and then gives it to the poor kan but he does he does he do that like like that style or he does it for his own good
mm wow that sounds very deep ya I realise you really like watching a lot of random netflix stuff okay um do you have any other topics to talk about
no right okay wait I know I know I know I feel like this question both of us can answer okay what labels do you think you have been given by society damn son this is a very deep question
in general
I mean you already out of school so
mm stereotypes ah
ya I get what you mean ah ya is a bit err a little bit offensive ya but I think honestly for that one it doesn't really affect me the one that I always keep hearing is oh you malay ah you in uni ah oh so you are one of the what ah a smart malay ah they literally label me as a smart malay
ya I don't know whether you you experienced that before lah but I got it a few times especially even some of my friends who are currently still saying it then I'm just like damn keep quiet guys ya I just ya lah I know I know recently also like especially during um the circuit breaker period a lot of the hoo-ha on these racial slurs and whatever has been going on
ya like like what what is the rest like of my society like how to say like by fellow malay people doing that like we get such a label ya like I don't feel like I deserve it
do you regret choosing your current path then I'm like am I supposed to is that like a serious question like I I kind of felt offended like why can't I just go and do something that I like ya so err aiya don't know lah I don't know why they asking this kind of question so I I just I mean it was a job interview so it's not like I can retaliate or something
ya then I just like ya it's just something that I've always wanted to do customer service ya then she was like oh okay okay okay but ya like like quite sian ah to hear these kind of comments ya I just hope that one day because now now like our generation more woke already right ya so I really hope that err everyone will try to like calm your tits
ya and just like try to I don't know be more mindful of what you say lah
he's on what on the ship oh
ya that's true
you know like that question also like made me think of this one situation like I'm not sure whether you know but Mendaki has this initiative like for um youth mentors to reach out to in a way like at risk youths ah
so I was interested because at that time I had a lot of spare time so I just sign up lah because err even though to me lah like even though you are only in a way impacting one person's life as a mentor that one person is gonna be grateful to you like for in a way maybe lah inshallah like for the rest of their life ya so like the impact even though you can only impact like you only have like such little impact in your opinion to this person
ya so like I remember that time when they asked me whether I had any concerns right I did ah I suddenly thought of it on the spot during the interview cause like for me like you know for me like especially before this I the way I speak was very english she find ya very very
straight laced person like from primary school to go to secondary school some more it was a girls school then from girls school go to err and then from go to uni so like it's something that I scared I cannot relate to to the students there because they are very different from me ya and then like
like I I don't know ah like I just cannot cannot handle it lah ya so I was just I ask them that then they were like oh don't worry lah I think from what we know about you right now at the end of the interview they said that like it should be fine ya
it is lah ya cause err one of the mentors was telling me that like err he was a he was a mentor a few years back then he said that like one of the students that he was mentoring ran away from home and he slept at this mentor's void deck for like three nights before he found out
oh damn we have been talking for like fifty one minutes
ah ah okay let's look for one more question mm
okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
isn't education free eh
that's true but technically also isn't it like
wouldn't you think like if
if the students work hard enough they're able to get scholarships to such places scholarships or bursaries are existing what right ya
I can't remember what's the other word ya like you know the the diagram of the like people standing over a fence then ya ya ya that that um analogy lah ya so like equity and equality right if I'm not wrong equity is making sure that everyone has enough resources individually
the customised amount of resources
ya ya
but then like for equality is like when everyone gets the same thing ya ya correct ya so like some people giving getting the same amount of assistance compared to someone who actually needs it more like may not appreciate it more lah ya I think is quite hard to differentiate like that lah
ya oh my god my throat
hey oh ya okay then for me what was the question again ah
um my first answer is food but that's not deep enough I tell you if free eh food is free right I will just I don't know why I would I would become a snowman ya okay wait let me let me try to think of a deeper answer um if something was free ah can I say time
ya
like you have all like literally all the time in the world
yes I want like you know like there is no such thing as time like people do not age people do not grow
is a like like your parents will be alive forever ya I mean ya lah like in a way is kind of what I will like you and but at the same time you won't savour moments as much ya wah it's like being immortal I cannot like I think I think I'll be super bored leh if I were immortal
no oh my god if I were a vampire
I think I will be a vampire because I get to sleep all day they go out at night I don't mind
ya cause like vampires ya you literally just be lazy ah okay maybe cause I just been watching a few movies right but vampires actually do nothing then like they just um and they have like superpowers that make it easy for them to hunt ya so like life is easy for them lah basically
aesthetics ya sia okay that's true that's true
I don't know and werewolves are ugly
unless you are like taylor lautner unless you can shape shift hmm will the werewolf be the shape shifting one maybe will be quite fun
okay no I think I will still choose to be a vampire I think in general vampires are a more accepted society no breed more acceptable breed in compared to um the werewolves ya cause werewolves is just like literally animals
ya damn okay then um I don't know would you rather be like

okay
again
no again
oh I cannot hear here
wait ah I clap

you see when should I increase my baby ounce ounce is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can eh as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty ah
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can ah
ya

so how did the anime help though
mm
oh that's cool
oh my god
this is like toy story
like tiny people like just random people
that's cool
err
okay like I I retook
O level art like
so I took O O level art two times ah the first time like I did it then I took it again in secondary five
uh so there was two time like the first one was like achieve it to my
grandfather who passed away
ya
so that was quite like close to my heart lah
like mm oh my god I'm gonna cry like err I incorporated like things that remind me of him like there's this biscuit lah like he always like offered me
he
ya so
and also err
there was a portrait of me and my family like sitting on the sofa and like uh our expressions were like sad lah to show
and for the sofa pillows kan like
uh
apples was also like something that reminded me of my grandfather because he he always knows that uh I like I like to eat apples so he or he would always like buy buy for me then leave it in the fridge then ask me to eat
so ya I made the pillows like uh apple like texture so ya it was kinda cool it's cool and for like the second
the second time I took uh O level art um it was
it was
I don't know it was like a quiff
artwork ah it was it was like mostly about my hair lah about my pink hair I don't like I didn't like it
at that time
it was just like a form of like expression
like uh previously there were like some people who say like I I wouldn't look nice with pink hair ya will look like
I don't know gross or something but then I'm like
no I'm gonna do it I'm gonna prove you wrong so I did it so I dyed my hair pink so like that became like my whole theme for my second artwork
so it was like
flowing hair
uh for like most of it was like a long canvas then then in the middle was like a self portrait and there was like ya a few other portraits around it
and I incorporated my sister in the artwork
so ya that was kind of cool
I miss painting and drawing
also like lately I've been trying to draw a lot
also I I I I joined a art competition like my school's art competition lah like it's being held from
like err err
like sketch club ah
so ya
ya for sure and I've been lazy
true true
yes
just high ah
true true
ya
like content heavy kan
true true
ya
just polytechnic life
so what are you planning to do for your future
mm
I see
I see
actually ya
ya I'm in like chemical engineering so that's quite interesting
so ya a lot of shit also is like content heavy lah
I think ever since like this intern right it really made me reflect on
like
what I want to do for the future and also like
what kind of work I want to be in too I think for now like my plan is like err
hopefully my grades is like good enough to go university lah
then uh let's see if I don't go to university
I think I might go for
earn and learn programme
ya like
like you study
but you also work at the same time
it's like
ya like
like you study for a few months then you go like attachment
so it's like a specialised diploma which I which I think is quite cool lah
like it's
some it's like a choice
that I can try
if if legit like I can't go to university or can't go to like earn and learn then I might just go to work orh
then if I go work I will I will like
work for two years then hopefully I can like try to
convince my future managers to send me to further studies
ya that's the plan
mm
because the pay for it is
still
true true
ya
it's quite sad
and I heard like there there will be like a second wave kan
ya
like
true
two K jobs like only earn like two K plus or like one K plus if you cut it even more it's like can barely survive seh
true
ya
but that's so bad lah obviously you have to change your lifestyle and if that happens
mm
true
true true
mmhmm
what
mmhmm
mm
but I'm shook
but I'm shook at the fact that he go Zoom call at the staircase like out of all places
mm
true true
mm
true true
a lot of now is also like they carry out using Zoom Zoom calls
you know
but that's so boring though
but okay lah at least something you know compared to like nothing at all
confirm when I grow up I want to be a farmer
I don't know
okay lah that
that kinda satisfies the my dream a bit
but I want to be like a full on farmer I don't know I think I've had this dream like since secondary school
like I
why why
uh
I know but like maybe ah maybe that's part of it ah but it's not like entirely him right it's not like I want to like have a farm with him or what sia like but I genuinely just want a farm
like I want to be rural
then like just vibing
you know
no I'm so shy
no
no
ya
true
oh actually true
but I don't think they do it on top of housing though
oh ya I guess so
you don't even eat vegetable like you don't eat your vegetables at all
ee
ee
that's another you
it's good ada vitamin dia semua
alright see I'm a genius
I need to tell that to my grandmother
but I hate mutton taste
I hate mutton it smells like shit
ya I like vegetable
why
oh you god yes
mmhmm
mm
mm that's cool
oo
oh my god
oh
to buy
to buy
yes
ya true
thick
like your thighs
mm
ya
a'ah
really
video
mm
mm
oh ah
I need that
I need that in my life but it's it's probably a lot of like
maintenance like you probably need to really take care of the plants and you really have to take care of the fish
I think you'll get dirty quite fast though
true
I think the the poop is gonna be more
than what the plant take in
damn that's
change the world
ugh uh is this a question
oh okay okay ah change the world I don't know oh my god I want to be more environment friendly oh my god talking about environment friendly
so I join like uh
like I join ah then I went to this
this uh
what's it called
I don't know what is it call it's like a outing I don't know it's like oh it it's a volunteer it's a volunteering
like uh
stands for bring your own bag like uh
they held this thing like uh we had to go to like various supermarkets then after that err we took the like bags that were donated from the public
then um we will take out those uh which are dirty then we will we will take the clean ones then uh we will go to the various supermarkets then we will offer
people who didn't bring their own bags so we will offer like the tote bags that were donated to for them to use as
like the grocery bags ah so it was quite so it's a
uh then
I think that is like actually a small thing that can like change the world like in a way like we should really like
cut down on our like plastic consumption lah
I think like plastic is really bad for us
like is so ingrained in our society that it's like super hard for like the society to change
to
like
like they implement like certain things ah to make it better
like I think the like pulau semakau like the like the island they put the trash all like
is getting filled out like quite fast ah then they go through
ya we will be fourty
ya but I feel like that tension is right not really pushing people like I feel like singaporeans are just like
ya true true
ya imagine like fifty cents it'll be like more like
ya for sure
so that's cool
why
and I never ask for plastic bag I bring my own bag
when
I'm so proud of
yes
change the world
yes just like how michael jackson sang it
change the world

ya we went there then after that
eh alamak closed closed then we went to err the
it's
ya ya ya ya there's one standalone stall
I don't know man I just there like okay lah
err
ya put aside lah it was
ya ya
ya wasn't so enjoyable because I was like ah shit you know so much so that
so same P one

err maybe one day we can ask him over lah
to our daughter
pass away who pass away
that was like many many many years ago right
ya err family eh
ya
so
ya lah
punggol punggol
I don't know like how many like
you know quota something like that lah but apparently
he
I'm not so sure I think what I I have a feeling probably it's an english school or what lah I never I heard lah I forget to ask what's the
the name of the school
ya
uh huh
yup
oh
okay wait for the place okay
okay okay okay I just now this err today lunch I ate at jurong point do you know that jurong point there is like a japanese kind of like halal place do you know
ya ya ya no no no no it was at err along this err
the swensen's all that lah that was that
I don't know
probably I think so ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
we we finished already we finished eating so we just pass by there
err
ya he just she's not into that kind of food lah I I think so lah
eh three daughters
like the the eldest one is like what twenty three twenty four like that
so ya lah
that's that
tomorrow err tomorrow tomorrow
uh
oh then after that the ya
then no after that no more already lah right
ya
okay okay okay
okay we see how aiya ilan madrasah
slippers you mean
mm
mm ya
oh okay
ah okay lah
okay
oo ya
oh
ya talking about her ah
oo that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story ah because err
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing lah but the timing is also like err odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish ah
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early lah but sometimes
ah they go off or sometimes
when you work late ah you have to finish late lah you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back ah
not that bad ah
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back lah right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off ah something like that or
something like that lah alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is err I think
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish ah
err I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know lah and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early lah to finish
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
then she oh then this one ah I will ask sani to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear ah kan
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out ah then after that she like go out ah then she like alamak aiya I like I also don't want ah to be leader you know
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything lah kan
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this one because they are like contract ah
ya contract not staff
you can you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this lah you put in extra hours lah you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing lah it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like err worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
ah ya
ya
ya ya ya
so the thing is like she's not supposed to know
like like like for example ya I want to quit ah and then if like okay you quit okay then who want to take over you ah hani ah hani can and
ah ya I know I know ya
so weird right probably
then like err
probably ya
ya ya ya
that's why so it's ya that's what the thing is
mm mm mm
yup maybe we should go there
art ground also ya
oh then you better check lah
mm hmm
eh
mm is it
ya ya ya ya
who who who just said ah I remember one of the maid does that
where is it ya
yulis do that can't remember lah that maid do that
so anyhow ya
oh I don't know no no ya okay wait
uh ya ya ya
kan
oh
you you you
know he has been sleeping late because ya every ya every night I come back
uh the light will be on not how
so I just
okay
okay
eh
so ya so probably what the art ground so think lunch at home lah ya probably lunch at home
I don't know that
oo okay
discovered ah
so I no no more already ah I did I did buy something like for myself some potato chips I think potato chips yes
then there is chocolate also we got chocolate right
snickers at the end I never I haven't tried
um
no
mm hmm
need to book what where where where where's that
where's the place ah jurong west ah
jurong west where
I don't know I don't know
I don't know lah seriously
group ah
like you call yourself like oh what from the ex black hole
if if I'm black hole I will sue them man
oh is it but I just I just find it weird lah
because it's it's like my brands lah
okay you you want to advertise ya I I I think I have to be upfront about it lah
like you don't use my brand ah
like say eh I'm from err Adidas like that one Nike you know
ex Adidas err it just logo right basis like shoes right
ya but but I think it's just because our context like singapore is too small I say it's like ah
I say like I'm I'm ex you know
I don't know I just I think like he
I just feel it like it
come from like you you leave me and you you open up the same thing as me you get what I mean not
so it's like I I leave
my
agency and I set up another agency but I still leverage on err that agency's name I think it's just
if you open up something else probably lah but I don't know
ya but you took to advertise I don't know
advertisement ah like you know right it's ah
if I if you are like the owner how how do you feel
ya ya where were you from oh I used to work here okay lah
it feel like advertise herself as that is the header lah
I'm from like ex ah
okay
I I think it's it's maybe not right lah
ya
ya so so many things err
ya
okay
okay
okay
oh
ya
oh
oh
the
okay
then his shoes his black shoes how ah
this one this shoes also quite new ah I don't know whether want to sell whether want to
then you sell and buy another shoes the one that the friend gave you know
right
never use lah that shoes
ask him to use but I think that that his black shoes still can use eh
but I I ask him to eh never wear this shoes what he says what
ya according to him lah I don't know
ya
oh that day got one somebody enquire about the
the japanese shoes you say you want twenty bucks then I say thirty bucks
then I say like thirty bucks lah you want I say oh I need to try I say come lah you come and try lor
then no answer already
so ya
mm
ya but I've been keeping it and not wearing it also so it's
no because the thing is to be honest the shoe is quiet big for me ah
I think bought err like
so I'm wearing err a nine point five but that one was a ten
eh
big big because different ah I think the cutting different certain shoes like like my Jordan I'm wearing nine but certain shoes I wear nine and a half
but
what I do right now buy shoes online right I would like go and try first
try first and after that
ya try
so this is my first time lah
okay
yes

ya see whether can
soccer boots soccer boots
actually can
can but I don't know that one is it's
right
what ten dollars
ya the soccer boots you should lah
err
ya because the thing is when I buy it's also second hand
so I don't know better
ya but I bought it second hand
that one I bought in so I don't know whether this one
authentic or not authentic so I really don't know really
because I went to the cobbler bukit maju right
then he say eh eh actually I got another shop at just wanna try it on

I have two boots
I fix one boot then I buy another boot why ah

oh same lah same lah like they all like multinational people but then they all cause they train in train in korea right so all of them in korea lor like you know all of them chinese member hor you all cannot go back ah so they only stay in korea
I think right
I think I'll be homesick lor cause ah I a bit of a mother's girl so a bit of mummy's girl so like my mother not with me ah I think I will like I don't feel comfortable lor then I will also definitely enjoy the experience ah going overseas and then study you know
you leh you ever thought about studying overseas
I think australia will be the most safest for me and like but then the thing is realistically speaking you also don't know if the cert can be taken in singapore but theoretically I want to study in korea why cause can see my oppa
hmm
or a bar right I saw recently did it just came up but
then I I also saw that thailand show I also started watching eh
oh cause actually my friend also recommended the show so I started watching ah cause I saw then I see the first episode cause my attention span not so good mah so I see forty minutes or an hour right I like a bit I a bit sceptical lah but then I started watching like the first episode wah not bad then I started watching the rest lor
oh cause my one I watch on Netflix so no advertisement
I leech off my cousin
oh talking about singapore ah cause they want to try to cause no tourist what so they want to try to increase the tourism board they got a lot of interesting attraction nowadays now fifty percent off at zoo eh or river safari or night safari I haven't been lor cause my family trying to get the tickets ah then there's also like discounted price for you know now is fifty eight dollar like including a LiHO drink then other than that um other that and the one land resort I think wildlife resort singapore maybe you can try everybody now going cycling at like pulau ubin or coney island have you been to coney island
same
other than work ah hmm
nothing much lah actually I just want find work cause I want get the money and also to pass by time cause like you said at home stare back then like keep ordering food ah become fat you know during this whole circuit breaker
spend a lot bro you know I tell you before got the online concert right weekly basis got this different group my favourite group lor so like they all like inside a unit tau so they got four sub unit I pay each and every single one of them luckily my sister also pay with me pay half half lor wah but that one really hit it eh every week got concert my money gone leh then got merch some more merchandise walao
secondary school ah
ya ya why my softball teacher my teacher wah seh
I don't know leh last I talk to him was in february I think cause I went down to school lor other than that not much eh cause his insta but never reply to
literature
you got a lot of people right in your group of friends
hmm
surprisingly no leh I never met any of them outside school I've never seen them not even teachers I've never seen teachers outside school but right a bit a bit funny cause I got a teacher who live near me but I never see her before like I know she lives there I seen her once or twice in secondary school but now I never see them anymore
ya ya ya that one
ah hangout ah
but right cause a bit also have but then I I I reason it out my mother ah cause she always make me say cannot other people one actually it's already out there if I don't finish then who else will finish you know
ya very troublesome because like I want talk to them also a bit mafan ah but then thankfully ah I don't have more than five group of friends lor is like in a group of friends I don't have more than five so like just swee swee just like that lor like swee swee less than five all lah like swee five so like don't need a lot of table like I see my friend that one that time they book three table leh I don't know how many people they have but three table then like very secluded so very difficult to like catch up with them so ya I a bit thankful lah for that
I always buy the standard shake with nata de coco fifty percent I now member mah so like I can the nudge you know so like when you collect the you buy the drink ah you collect the point then you can like off set when the next time you buy then you know last time during circuit breaker cause last time mister coconut and bubble tea all close right then you got see or not the trend they got buy the handmade LiHO then they make it at home you got see
you you you got try or not
ah no ah cause I find it a bit expensive also ah then like the bubble tea the boba ah the pearl ah a lot leh then I scared cannot finish then is is a it's like a golden pearl kind then I don't really like the golden pearl I only like the black pearl or the black sugar pearl eh brown sugar pearl
I got try eh Playmade but I don't really like Playmade eh to be honest cause ah their pearl is a different ah it's not tapioca pearl it's not like the normal pearl it's a different kind of pearl lah then I don't really like the taste ah then the I know everybody like Playmade ah but like I find their pearl a bit a bit a bit questionable not to my taste bud ah probably probably you can try then you see then you tell me lor
I
no eh I never but like cause last time my sister same poly as you ah she also say she always buy like McDonald's only like subway I got try your school subway that one once only but then I also know your school McDonald's is cheaper then outside McDonald's right
I saw their McDonald's cone is seventy cent
actually uh I never really properly by iris only follow my friend maybe I should try one day then you leh
I think standard ah I think all poly also got subway and cheers also if I'm not wrong you school got cheers
I also know your school quite big then how ah if you late to school or like you swee swee you just ah you know five minute before school you reach then how ah you confirm late or not
actually not really ah honestly if I late to school then my my my my class at the end of the school ah only take me about five five minute to reach there so I can like speed walk then I can just reach earlier but it's quite quite space ah got a lot of big spaces lor but better ah than it being cramp I guess so like not too bad ah but still small ah but like spcious also to say the least if I'm not wrong also my school the smallest poly right
no ah nanyang nanyang bigger then then then then my school
honestly right um my first few days of school ah my first few weeks I cannot make it but then but then like afterwards like okay already lor uh but then like uh how to say ah your my school um some food court they two different lifts must take right specifically that one I a bit confusing ah and then the one behind my school is just the sports centre so that one only if you got like if you got like like that ah like then you go there lor
hmm
um honestly cause of COVID right people will kick you out even if we are students right they don't allow us to like stay there so they like they say got one time the I saw the security uncle tell the person you you over here what you want do you got school or not then the person then the student the student was like no I want study then you should study at home ah the uncle was damn rude eh then cause the person was taking quite some time to pack right then he was like what you waiting for christmas is it wah like this security uncle cannot say nicely meh COVID already then like be understanding ah we understand you got superiority but like
hmm cannot ah I think they will be stopped at the entrance I think like cause they wear uniform already mah then I don't think so they can go in so like I don't know I don't even think so they can cause nowadays when I go back to school some times I don't see them like coming over also then like I think it's um a a rule for them to go back home afterwards I don't know but either way also the place is crowded lor cause got student want to use the wi-fi for mah ya
ya but like our table not so far apart um like they put us five people per table but like how to say ah um they so one metre one metre also the table but then now five people per table without the one metre ruling mah that one a bit ah cause my teacher sometime don't know if it's true or not so they ya but then also cause of the five people per table one metre away right my teacher also a bit more careful I guess but like ah don't know ah it's just a bit lor
um sometimes it cannot be helped ah because like is mah then everybody need to use it need to take it for for to travel to paxes cannot expect them take Gojek and all the transport mah so like um sometimes cannot take it ah cannot be helped so like public transport cannot be helped ah
a bit scared ah but like I said cannot help it like I a bit scared cause I live with my grandmother so it's uh the thing is more contagious to them you know more higher risk for them so sometimes I a bit scared leh but most of the time so you just go home you straight away bathe lor don't interact with other people I think that's the best ting to do lor
see uni cannot go out she every time got chance she go out you know how old people are you know how they are they cannot sit still one the always want go out like that then like most of time we tell her cannot ah cause a bit far the places she want to go like her sister's house at bedok eh a bit far then her sister also want bring her go mall and stuff but then my grandmother also a bit ah cause she you know got the safe entry all right then she like she like a bit lazy she don't know how to do the safe entry mah she find it very
ya lah typical she doesn't like to take unless like she late lor then she take Gojek lor or she take grab
no ah it's actually me I help her book then she just pay lor
nowadays got not much work from home ah but then rest of my family members all work like my sister now she in camp ah then the rest all is um cannot work from home ah so my mother my parents they go to work physically to you know earn the bucks
uh I actually don't mind ah cause she make food mah so I just eat whatever she cook lor
ya cause fast game ah just touch and go so I just go there then come back then like that lor
if I go school right I just buy something for breakfast then I go home to eat my grandmother lunch I don't like you know uh eat outside so that's the good thing ah I I get to save money like that
wah then especially are especially hor they tax you see what they could wah kung fu aunties anticipate at their excited one ya ah anyways ah I think it's time to let go I think we I think we are done catching up I think
nevermind give this person some time ah cause COVID mah then the business never go up at least at least give them some some some money you know
ya serious ah whatever lah okay lah

okay can
hey you aunty
I'm doing okay
you you then the pain all you can feel it
you were alone in the hospital
sister are you a single mother
alright it doesn't matter lah the what mattered is the baby is there ya if the baby so what happened
oh really ah so you only dream like just the you giving birth process only lah
oh so you didn't but then you say the next day you got dream some more
aww
could you feel like the maternity love already
ah like a responsibility ah
then when you wake up from it like what do you feel
so so now you want to have a baby in your life
I don't know I feel like it's very weird cause I don't get this kind of a dream but like somehow you get this kind of dream is like I feel like it's a sign but I also don't know lah what is a sign
ah ya ya
whether you are responsible enough like yet lah
okay cool sis so anyway um
you know ah later I'm going to go err have a job interview
then this job interview I'm having ah is asking me ah all type of weird questions one
come with our own answers so that later at the interview I will know how to answer the person lah better
okay so the one of the questions the like interviewer asking is um
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would be inside
ya lor
mm mm mm mm
oh
err but then your diary would it be like rage or like would it be like reflecting
ah so okay imagine yourself at eighteen
raging
ya ya ya
ya I remember you telling me about your friends they're like quite toxic right
what would the okay then if there's a time capsule from ten years ago ah what what would you probably be saying to yourself
oh ah
which you are kind of okay okay or not not at all
ya ya so long ago also
me ah I think ah ten years ago I was sixteen right
oh
ya I was already outside mixing with the outside people so probably ya and I think
I don't think I was also depressed or lost or anything I was just very like exploring life at that point of time because
ya like from julie I met so many people and then also I met hakim or risahd which is nothing to do with julie meeting him at sixteen was a blessing sia like if I didn't meet him right
activities are very lah so it's very good as compared to like if let's say I was mixing with the same kids still it's not really good right because like they drink and everything
and then like I might have boyfriends but with hakim also we were just friends so it was really good and then he will bring ahmad along so we go gig we go um
so I think if I were sixteen probably what I would say to myself and I broke up wait I haven't met amin yet so
probably I will say to my sixteen year old self like
hello girl girl ah
eh you how are you still you still got boyfriend or you no boyfriend I hope whoever your boyfriend is you happy lah okay
err are you still longboarding err probably all that lah probably asking how is she doing in life like me now
and if I think most probably my sixteen year old would just want to know whether I'm happy like ya even then I think happiness was just my aim it didn't it didn't matter like
what I was doing in life ya it just mattered like I was peaceful and was happy that's all
so ya if I will say to if I read that then I will probably tell her or him like
I doing good yo I'm doing super good
ya I got this shit ah I mean it took me some time but twenty six is the year yo twenty twenty I got my shit together
okay okay so
the other question they will ask me ha is the
um
walao eh got so many questions you know they ask
oh ya ya ya what is the pettiest reason you would dislike someone
okay
but that's so like normal though
okay lah okay lah ya ya but it's also very human nature I feel
ya very petty
what what other things would you be petty about
oh
a'ah ah
but does this apply only to like your is it friends or contacts guys or like what or people in general
guys ah right ya
cause if girls like you know it's nothing personal right it's like you
ya ya ya
but with guys it's a bit more like deeper also it's like rude hello you're a man okay I give you my time
oh ya lah ya lah
ya ya she's just making your life difficult
uh huh uh huh
walao eh why she like that one
like how dare you block my way you want to fight is it huh you want to fight
me ah pettiest reason ah
err pettiest for reason for me to oh my god
even if I dislike someone I don't think the reason would be petty like you know me like the reason has to be so strong for me to like not like the person
okay lah petty reasons like just not say hate but it's just like aiya like dislike a bit ah ah it's like our dearest lor
ah like like she never do anything like outright to like harm us but
like it I guess the pettiness is coming from like the way she talks like the way she talk like it's it comes off as like
if ah like at work there's this engineer he's not the same department as us
so ah sometimes I will fall asleep so who's fault is that it's my fault right not supposed to fall asleep but ah
ya that's true okay but then again it is lah correct lah it's our fault we shouldn't sleep at work I know that like it is a like common sense thing
but ya but then ya lah it becomes petty because ah whenever I see him now I don't like him only because everytime I fall asleep at work
I will get traumatised and think of him ah like ah no no no later that guy will come and scream at me
ya
what other reason could we be petty about like not liking someone like it's not like hate like not hate lah right just like annoyed
can
oh is it like what
oh ya ya ya ya I think me too also I think everyone lah right
ah
mm
mm
ah ah oh oh oh
oh because you were julie
oh cause so she thought that whole thing was messed up lah
ya because she didn't know like the true story and everything
ya ya correct correct that's judging it off
ya ya ya oh you mean she said hi to everyone except you
oh I think she's one of those girls that's like if I don't like you I'm not going to fake it like ya that's it lor
ya lah ya lah for me like I think the pettiest not pettiest lah this one is not so petty I don't know whether it's petty or it's um
okay petty reasons people might not like me in the past ah right it's just like
like some people like make up story about me last time like the name the nickname don't want to say here
then another person will just take that nickname and be like oh is it okay lah then I also don't like her now even though they don't even know me know then like
what I do sia I don't know I just come sia so it's like
and then it's just because of the nickname I had last time which was wrongly like portrayed by someone else
so I thought that was very petty I think another reason why err ah like I got it was also a petty reason why like a girl didn't like me last time in class ah was because
the guy that she liked in class like me and then after that err her guy best friend also like me then then she don't like me but then you know what's the worst part is that she is like
best friends with me in class one not
ya ya like and then like
ya then eventually I found out that eh you know ah she she say ah like she got say to me before
why why all these guys like me lah ah she said her tits not even that big my tits are bigger
that is just shows that I have small tits and guys still like don't you think it's something to do character rather than your err physics ya exactly
okay so far it's okay
eh but then ah she took the worst vengeance on me possible you know
one year later she entered the same as my boyfriend at that point of time I didn't know that they were the same then they went overseas for the to bangkok I think
then my boyfriend came back right then he confessed to me he sort of cheated on me he touched this girl he touched this girl then
he touched this so he touched this girl then after that he tell me he touched this girl because um she said that she's a lesbian so he touched her boob to like prove her that she's not
you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate then lulu like always go around with like the different key went like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she like which I didn't even like you know or you care about I didn't work with them like they were just friends but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend ah like you
go around with like the different he even like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she liked which I didn't even like know or even care about I didn't go out with them like they were just friends
but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend lah like you
especially because she knows you are my boyfriend
wah I like never felt even more betrayed at that point of time
that such a person exist that can be so
so ya lah but like afterwards I don't feel anything for her lah I feel more sorry for her that she had to go to that length to get man's attention
ya like going to that length of like ya I've never been touched by a boy before like girl I know you did you know something with my ex-classmate
that was an interesting time like like if I see her now like I won't be I won't hate her lah but it's more of like a bit disgusted
what she did back then but ya also like like just hope that she's changed now lah it's just more of like
mind blown by it like walao eh like I could never sia go through that trouble for man ya lor
so ya petty things ah huh that people so it's not really I petty with people people was petty with me one but it's okay this is life I already got used to it
now they petty with me I'm unbothered one
alright okay this one is if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mmhmm
oh mm mm
ya ya
oh my god that's so cool but you can already play no cannot eh
a'ah ya lah ya lah
err can play a lot of things siol can play the piano keyboard ya still got one more
it could be anything in the world like even if you're not going to use it as often but it's just like uh so it's just a random skill like oh you so you can do that then you're like ya lor I can
oh that's great sia like you don't need to call people for shit anymore
and save money also
and then I'm like die lah ending and then you're like no I can do it then I'm like oh she got the spirit
I love how mine got the random red like when I'm very excited
walao eh confirm can one lah it's just one line don't be petty lah we're just talked about being petty okay so
ya okay for me right
obviously the first skill I will take is cooking ah
then it's not just convenient for myself but it's convenient for like my loved one like if I want to cook for my friends my family so I think it's a very useful ah skill
second skill um
so random ah but I would pick up sea sea diving eh
mm so fun sia
like in general I've uh I've always been intrigued by the sea
like that's why when shai like her videos ya tioman I always feel like wah best sia ah like I want to
but even before I know that she was inside I already had friends who already went inside so I've already gotten like that kind of aspiration where oh it's very doable you just go tioman
ya but so far eh you know can touch the okay okay cannot touch the coral but you can see kan everything so so first is the cooking so I can be master chef for my family and friends then second is sea dive so that I can be relaxed in the water
if I could pick up
ya ya
a'ah a'ah ya
correct
so it can be done you just have to learn
alright sia then like that you do not have to have talent you just have to have correct and then eventually that can be talent also
hard work correct and that eventually that can be talent also
that's even like more hard work talent seh because you were not born with it you worked for
okay like that I will take the singing lah
but then I won't be singer lah like I won't have that much free time
I'll just be me and my friends like guys I can sing out some karaoke ya lor
okay good to know I feel like I'm getting to know you better as a person through these questions ah
ya lor ya lor
how do you think oo
ah
hmm
light effect
alright um wah if you get a chance to wake up as an actor okay I need to prompt if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day
which actor would you become and why
ya lor
I know right
okay this one is the actor is the very everybody will know one
oo
correct correct even though his true personality is so reserved and mysterious but he can in his
he really manages to err exercise different parts of his like personality through like movies
ya lah ya lah you skip that part lah
no you you now if you wake up as him now he's already over the mishap people the whole world know him already so the
so you must say this so you must explain
mm where is it okay which actor one day which actor you want to become and why
alamak you kills
oo
okay his singing career and also I think he made maybe a few booboos but then again kan he's young
ya like we at that age also we said a lot of stupid things we are cringey
but then I'm like you all shut up lah you all young
ya it's not enough to ruin what he has already done so far at umbrella academy sia
ya and makes him human ya
he's still eighteen
ya
going to paint history
he is even more powerful sia season two
ya
he's so weird he's creepy like okay you all you all not cultured guys ya okay so for me if I had to choose one actor to wake up as
I would definitely choose joseph gordon levitt
people will know him as tom err from the five hundred days of summer
it's because why is because I think he is honestly such a brilliant person like
he is doing his own like company for the past several years where
he's so amazing lah like he gives platform for like like independent like artists all over the world to showcase their work from like
so he doesn't use like existing like people who is already rich no he wants to give everyone a shot and like ya it's called hits record
he was sharing ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so he really picks up tendon from anything and anywhere and I find that so inspiring and in fact I think he's been sprang to me even since that friendship just assemble I like how work he has been from the start you life
ah he will share it ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so
he really picks up talent from anything and anywhere and I find it so inspiring
and in fact I think he's been inspiring to me even since that five hundred days of summer I like how vogue he has been from the start of time
like even about his character like everything about him right to me is the equivalent of the most unproblematic
man on earth and I know he's married lah but he even then he's so low key about his marriage and
you can tell he's not just also married like a woman just because she's hot but he's married her for her intellect and kindness and everything
so I would love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does and everything
so I'd love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does for err everyday
okay eh no but then I would also choose johnny depp but if I were to choose johnny depp it will be more for his
I learnt about johnny depp's err wife not wife ah they never married ah vanessa paradis I fucking loved her I was so obsessed with her
and I love his kids and everything so I would probably wake up as him to just
he okay another person okay sorry this one is also this one is also actually quite epic ah if I could wake up as her right is also really amazing
angelina jolie
cause she's also another like inspiration but like girl version lah actually I love zooey deschanel but I think angelina jolie has a bigger impact on the world lah she's like
and then on top of that she's a humanitarian like the devoted humanitarian and like
on top of that she's angelina jolie like even if she didn't do all that humanitarian stuff right she's already awesome because people will love her as an entrepreneur
but she has all of that even more so it makes her even more like humane ah even more kind and imagine your ex-husband is brad pitt like the fish
so I would love to wake up as her and just also see what she does in a day ah like I think she's so inspiring sia like she's a mum to like
all types of kids like you know from vietnam to africa then they all really consider her as a mum she allows her kids to err explore religion and see what is beneficial to them and
ya she's connected with like different parts of the countries like of the world the third world that even we have never
she's even connected more with muslim countries so like ya I would love to be her sia for a day I think she's so inspiring like even though people love to villainies her because of the whole brad pitt and jennifer aniston thing but I feel like
that's so little compared to what she's done correct
ya at that moment I know it must have gone down so real but then again that's like twenty almost ten to twenty years ago
and then like with jennifer with because with angelina she was already like wanting to have babies and like settle down whatsoever lah
but whatever it is ya lah like cheating cannot be justified lah right it is still wrong but
I still feel like brad pitt and uh angelina as a couple still made like more good than it was bad like not just it wasn't just for them but it was like for the whole world
even because of angelina jolie brad pitt also became more humanitarian and did stuff so like ya I really love her as a person
like she's a gemini so I was like sia lah a true gemini sia this girl like she
she will be like she will seduce the the host and everything then make them criticism like sia that's like me but like back then lah when I was reckless lah so
I really love her so much because she also still has this really like you know vulnerable side of her
so ya jennifer ya and angelina jolie and then the actor joseph gordon levitt wow
ya oh my god you imagine if you can wake up as a K-pop artist though
imagine if you wake up as your uh stray kids or like
what do you mean
ya because ya you have to be super disciplined
if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
ya ya like ya if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
caveman ah
ya
okay okay imagine so so you
ya if humans don't have to work to survive what would you I think I don't know what about the thing
until I die
oh maybe okay like so meaning transaction there still has to be transaction or something but it's not money anymore
so people has it you could be entertainment like you need this give me three dances
ya what is your capability what can you do ah can you give me a massage
but I've already got three hugs from the girl before can you give me something more than a hug
err I can't
err no no no no okay okay okay take all the food you want
no lah it's our opinion mah
we're not talking about the government we're talking about the opinion
okay lah obviously I appreciate like whatever is on channel five suria like they they definitely gave their best but I'm just saying
oh my god imagine
it would be so epic sia
I think it'll be so funny because
like it's not meant to be funny but because you know like in singapore characters in general can be so
walao eh
ya lor ya lor actually the races do get together when we are against like a specific
but then ya lah for but then the ones that was be standing at the answer end was like no ya where ah
ya what's next what's next
how do you think humans you will become extinct let's take this question in a sense that is we obviously know how lah right cause of islamic so
take that we imagine like imagine that's not the lah so it's just purely in our imaginations ah
ah how do you think humans will become extinct use your wildest imagination
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm correct
eh my god I can imagine sia my one is the zombie
then after that err getting comfortable
then she becomes the first zombie then she bite her the husband she bite the child
no eh but then ah you know the singapore and is like connected by that that
thing right I don't know I think our our government will
okay says my imagination right is the fast type but they are allergic to water so they cannot swim to singapore
will train each other how to kill a zombie in case they will come everybody will be prepared it's not just the army but it's like everyone
but ya we got army for that so our army will be taking care from the inside the borders and kill all the zombies before they can come
so this is why like singapore becomes like the safest place to be at because we are the smallest
malaysia will spread to indon indon will spread to like the portuguese and then to thailand and then to eventually lor
so I think I give them one year or maybe one month lah then the whole world will die except for singapore
maybe singapore eventually lah when but singapore will be the last lah to die I will give us
ya I will give us the hero
so we will start the rationalising like crazy lor so we were all lose weight very drastically
oh okay obviously at each country oh ya because this one humans were extinct right no hope what so no choice lah everybody will die eventually depressing
alright
ya because of a pandemic seh
err
ya
mm ya lor
uh anyway
what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
oh my god eh wait wait wait but is activity eh
but then it ya it has to be an an eight hour straight work we're already doing eight hours so it's just like err maybe a normal activity you do but imagine you have to do it for eight hours damn
it doesn't have to be something you hate so it's just like everyday activity it would be torture if you had to do it eight hours
ya like okay so we're on to this the third round ya
next okay next
ya
eat damn slow lah like one rice at a time cannot already I think ya exercising definitely lah like sia I imagine like running running for eight hours
everything what other thing maybe is the err
but that one is like quite therapeutic sia sometimes too ya
ya honestly sleeping but then sleeping you know eight hours
ya
sleeping is always eight hours also you don't lor I'm willing to torture myself for eight hours if it's sleep
what other things that we do like everyday activities sia
pee imagine like someone force you to pee for eight hours
pee some more pee some more I can did I try
produce more lube liquid
how how many more minutes
I think around twelve minutes
uh uh
if you
if you had if you have any unusual superpower what would what would it be
what
walao eh
and it's not like it's not as such a major thing that will ya change the rest of your life
it will just inconvenience them for like one day so it's like a good good
ya lor then we just like then we just like diarrhoea
then he like ugh okay nevermind you
ya it is the most innocent
like revenge but it is a useful one
how did you think that at the tip of your mind it must mean you have had thoughts right
would you want the unusual power to be like see the ghosts
but even then he was so depressed for like so many years of his life he was so like schizophrenic
but this one even more sia you cannot sleep in peace eh you sleeping there lah then like then got hi
then another one hi the patient will like uh shut up
you all want to talk to me can I'm going to control you
please entertain me now
ya he was very that's why he became like a drinking drug addict he wanted to run away from all the ghosts so irritating sia like everyday every second you have to listen to them talk
so many exactly
and some are nice and some are ya and they're not visually looking nice
alright okay so
ya lor who know you got the dark secret but ya lah I think seeing ghosts is more of like a curse than it is a blessing ah
but I mean there are people out there who can see third eyes so I hope they have it fixed in their life
ya ya ya
you mean like there's friends who will fake it
ya lah
but it's too dramatic ah
girl or boy
ya ya ya
how old is he again ah one year older eh or your age
oh
twenty six eh twenty eight
oh nineteen eighty nine that's quite old
see how is he doing our you know uh it's the same uh the popular do example in boring know holiday get social media guitar but the girl number but marching to jackie either look ya ya time right my checks you know okay so for me my unusual super
is he how is he doing now do you know
aunt allyson has eh is damn
ya eh it's damn strong sia babe you can literally manipulate the whole world
but it is I mean it it ya but it can be quite messed up if she was villain
luckily she's not a villain babe if she's a villain she can get everything her way
ya lah so that's why I said unless she use that power only
and not to make someone like or someone whatever situation worse ah
I would love that power
okay you're now going to be mature I feel like we can't do that because
then we plant the seeds for them so that's why we even with the robber that I said just now right like let's say he was going to rob someone
I could have said okay you're now going to be a good person starting tomorrow to me it doesn't feel authentic from him
so that's why it it has to be like okay from today on you going to reflect on yourself why you're doing this and you're going to question the
purpose of life ah so just plant a seed and then see where they take ya I think for allison
I mean it's not her fault lah kan because like with that power nobody knows how to really use it what and she had to go through her downs for her to like oh shit to ya learn that
I can't use it but then again eh honestly I know her ex-husband hated her cause she used that for her daughter right
the what she asked for her daughter was kind of a small thing what it was like a
I heard rumour that you don't want to read the book anymore
everytime they reshow that scene I'm like so graphic
I always thought she died seh for good right
but the it's like she's just what the fish sia
oh and then he's said oh why didn't you use this earlier so to what get you like clothes wow
ya and you are the one who preaches about being the change the movement and then like
and then you are the same person who's like so did you use it on me like
ya
ya
I feel like allison is compromising a lot sia she's so nice like nah
seeing the way ray treated her I'm like at least luther is genuine sia and
he loves her as she is he so cute when they're so awkward
alright
okay so maybe last question
what is the one thing you wish was free
oh my god
mm that's why
okay ah
oh my god you're so right
ya lor stay here forever lah
but that's the thing right
ya but you stay at your own house mah
okay maybe maybe not rent maybe is buying a house because rent right if it's free how to say ah it is still like monthly right so if you buy a house it's free like
no one in singapore is going to buy a house it's like automatic when you're twenty one a house is registered to your name
like okay at twenty one you are all
err entitled to a
then it moves to okay twenty five okay if err twenty five you are now entitled to a four room flat
but ya bro that was a that was a good idea what else what else could be free I think
damn cannot lah seh
then will be like
yes why do we have to pay for something that will be with us for ya
ya lah I get that like the factories did all these and they have to be paid but I mean I don't know
do you really have to pay like
condoms okay lah
alright uh
what do you mean what you mean person interview a political up all right
oh right right right right okay eh I get to know you more lah seh babe from here

yeah when the last time we meet ah
oh yeah yeah yeah then it was like damn rushing cause like we came there at nine then but then it close at nine thirty
yeah so long and then some more don't have the ah pearls that I want like seriously

so like it was a very tough year four especially we are in our third year and we have to deal with this so I think like I'm quite proud lah
year for us especially we are in our third year and we have to deal with this so I think like I'm quite proud of us yeah
ha is it

yeah I don't know what what what is like trending now what's what do you think a good business actually now

oh my god we should open the cafe together
yes yes
mmhmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
full business like
like
yeah yeah and all
so like I think that's a good idea because like you never know whether your business will flourish and be successful so
a'ah
yeah
yet
true
one
one thing for your
is that we should open
I think the west people will appreciate it
ya that's why we should like oh my god you know what you should do we should
also sell bubble tea at same time that's what will make us have money gain money yes

eating cookies with chocolate sauce
I think the kids will love it lah but I think they don't need the sauce also we're just gonna eat the cookies
it's just one jar
I haven't check yet I haven't call him I don't know he said uh help him sell all he said I can take to sell all his wife accessories that
she never use before then I said okay but I will take some time to take pictures of individual of or I mind individual items
I don't know if I have time I's like
we're having task here and there I I don't know I'm just I'm going to put aside first lah
no he he ya lah he meant that way but I don't know if he wants me to sell it he got the profit of it or he just giving it to me
uh
the
email right
not yet
nope no emails yet
not yet
it's not yet lah I think sooner probably I think maybe waiting for teachers
no they asking about you but okay lah
you all go and make your own plans lah we make plans
and after that we still need dessert and we still need coffee is they got so many things to talk about
you lah
what's yours
must be the crumbs lah don't know how many time we must wipe the table
kids
it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time
is it end of the year thing is it
I I expect you to go to the one at bugis the bigger one
ah that's
hospital
then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
oo that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government
eh
you have to wait equipment first ah
oo I thought they pay for you
who
huh you know you have a friend but you don't know who
oo
oo
you saw him or he told you are
oo
what you mean they have different different team eh
err
okay lah think can you can make it lah
ya lah
lah whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first lah while waiting for something that you used to do
lah
later the zoom
you do alone eh I I don't need to join you okay
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
the first to teach err tasha
get the malay students to love
malay
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
so that's why I think it's a great loss err and she's there I think according to tasha it's like what she's only there for three years
so tasha was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one lah
uh
tasha is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
tasha is the first batch she teach three years lah
three years eh five years
ya initially tasha doesn't like her what
but in the end
a'ah see
her class what
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is nadia she pick and choose
it will affect her this what I notice ah
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around lah
because I think
tasha tasha also what
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
which now you don't expect her to dance lah she's got no interest already
nadia my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that oo tag rugby
oo touch rugby tag rugby
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego ah the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active lah she is like she is active since young so
she's daring lah she she has the confidence
can lah let her try lah
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store lah tasha tasha hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs lah
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set what knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay lah
it belongs to tasha or belongs to her
then it should be able to lah and tasha use
should be lah it's kids size what
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
eh she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
err going bishan on friday
I need to pass my sister all her stuff
going bedok saturday eh
I know that's why she said come on saturday because she's not going to jurong so everybody's there
sunday is a brothers in law second marriage
eh
they detect eh this saturday wow it's handy
so fast
oh ah
I need to do my report soon
no you soon
you get better
eh today's is what
nineteen
today is nineteen see
I'm not working I still can get the dates right
I buy something lah
later you get tasha to I think we have nuggets hashbrown finish
fries finish
nuggets only then maybe if you want desperate lah
the boys yesterday refuse they took only coco crunch I think they finished up the whole batch ah
the whole box
try try not to give so much ah they're coughing
haris haris haris coughing
so I'm not worried they drink a lot of plain water and when they cough they look for water which is good
very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you lah see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast lah
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway lah but she haven't message me
peck seah P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start err preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time lah the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind ah if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
but they have they have tuition what
amirah's err siblings they have tuition
ah
I thought amirah go for err oo visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
uh but math class
my only worry is nadia's math I mean ya now she's average ah but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is tasha cannot help much also with maths
at least science
err english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind lah
at least if we start her early because we started tasha like only in P five
right started tasha with five
hmm
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as tasha
ya she did
okay lah
together
oo
K

ah
because I only have class dojo
class dojo is like only

ya
err
the one I have here is the northern spain but we already I'm correct ya

mm mm mm
ya
eh I've never been on a like a train like a train ride leh
mm
ya
ah ya ya
mm
it's already three
oh wells
yes and we planned to go to portugal remember
ya so it says highlights spain and portugal this trip shows spain and portugal at their best the alhambra palace the hanging houses of cuenca the historic part of cadiz and vibrant cities like madrid valencia and lisbon
mm
mm
is it
ya but I know she wanted ya she wants to go
lisbon lisbon
ah
never mind lah the husband ah you book another room ah so like iffah can alternate like between the our room and their room
eh
february
chinese new year
long leave ah
oh
this year was like late january right
mid correct
ya
ya my ex-colleague
no iffah is in february then the other two's in july then my cousin is getting married is getting married on ten of july then I was like
postpone it
oh
talking about it I don't whether can say it here but anyways
I mean I don't know but ya okay but never mind I just say lah I think it doesn't go anywhere but what's this
you were from griffiths right
then you should know
amalina
she was from griffiths primary
your age
why would a guy be named amalina
I don't know whether you will remember cause ya it's primary school so I'm not so sure
mm
ya so you don't remember lah
ya
ya so anyways ya the cousin
my cousin got married to this amalina lah ya
yes
ya
ya but after that she went to err ngee ann secondary ah
and then uh
mm ya
oh angsana yes
ya
zhong zheng or
why ah
is it
that's why I don't understand why primary schools like are considered like there are better schools and not better schools I'm like in my head it's like it's primary school like how how better can better be
I mean children are still
so they depend on you grade lah
like to get to a good school but in my head like it's just primary school like how
how what how as in how good can good be and how bad can bad be
huh
tiger parents it's just parents nowadays ah
kiasu
mm
orh
orh
for for one year ah
one year
mm
how much is school bus eh
hmm
ya
mm
hmm
I think should be fine
I don't know lah should be fine
ya it's not red yet so it's fine ya
ah
nearly
then I have to move also
ya
oh yes I forgot that I got one good news today
and then like now the parents are working from home but they're gonna work from office soon so it'll be quite difficult for them to like send and fetch him ya from school that kind of thing
so I was like yes ah
ya he's present he's rent ya definitely ya but I'm thinking maybe
ya so I have got that off my hands so maybe it's a sign also that I should just stay on the class for another year
ya
the ya is him
ya not exactly okay it is him but like other children also but then again I cannot complain because all children are different and I should learn to accept them so
ya
and and and every and every class has its challenges so
ya
one one more year and then ya I'll leave lah
ya see how it goes
ya
it's like
amazing then I was telling her I don't know how you do it man like
but if you handle older kids also the downside is like the stress from you know if you deal with
older kids lah also it does affect right ya
so ya
yes true
ya
but for like my line is like more how to say um
ya
ya
older kids ah I think can but then depends also on
the boss and whatever not ya but like for her because her cert is only covers err
the younger age group ya
ya what were you trying to say sorry
mm
orh
mm mm mm mm
approval lah
so who decides
the deployment
okay
you see the teachers but you don't see the
people like rarely right
oh so they do teach
wah
busy ah
like
mm
trust me I think you told me before ya ya ya
mm
mm
it's set auto eh
mm mm mm mm
you say it's uh
ya
ya
ya
oo
ya they earn quite a lot imagine if a childcare teacher okay can earn three K max is three point two
ya so what more if it's like a principal a higher position
ya
ranking
so there's um
so it's like a just the level teachers so like
uh
I wouldn't say nursery is the lower level but basically just preschool teacher then there's a senior teacher who usually depends on the centre so there's a senior teacher more of like a supervisory but basically it's just the same thing lah just teaching and whatever not
ya so teacher senior teacher and then vice principal if your centre needs one then principal
and then err depends again on the
like the organisation that you are in so like last time I was in young school for kids above then
principal is err cluster cluster head
ya so cluster head is like in charge of like the few principles in a certain district or something like that
ya
ya so ya lah I mean basically you can climb lah
ya
it is a job actually meant for you to kind of
ya like my
for cannot
then you have to always be on your phone ah
ya after work hours there's no such thing as after work hours that kind of thing
no no no no
this world is not for us so
ya
how to say um
I don't know what I'm saying
yes yes yes ya
ya exactly ya

I mean like I guess
a lot of them are like they all look the same you know they kinda
they have the long black hair then they all they're all sponsored by like Shopee and
ya I don't know
that's true
ah
how much is fifteen thousand yen in
it's the same it's fifty thousand dollars
oh
Apex players
I mean I just think it's
like do the controls and stuff then I was quite new to the game then he ask me come nearer then I'm like okay I'll come nearer then he said it'll come a bit nearer nearer nearer then I'm like okay I'll come a bit nearer then you know he taunt kill me which is basically like you you take like he like he pressed Q and then it makes your character do something cool and then it kills you so he stabbed an arrow up my body and then I flopped and a died ya
no no no no no ya but
basically
ya that's my experience I guess after that
did I I think
no it makes sense
it's pretty normal lah I think to be honest the only reason why my like
controller ya then he would we would just play like Street Fighter lah or like Super Mario and stuff then he will lend me his game boy then I started playing Final Fantasy when I was like six but you know like at that age you don't even understand what's going on so I wasn't really good at Final Fantasy lah I didn't understand the strategy then like until this year also I don't like strategy games ya but then cause of that like I got used to the controls like from a early age I guess then on top of that I used to do sports like you know in primary school uh like I used to be from floorball ya you know cause I did ya you know I was team captain also like but that's just because the rest of the team didn't care but that's besides the point then
err I guess cause of all of that my hand eye coordination got
oh I I played I played COD like a long time ago cause it got boring it's just you refresh the round then after that you like shoot people and then it's like the same cycle ya so now I play PUBG ya with riti but I used to play PUBG in secondary school also it was uh like cause the other girls in class they didn't really play games then I was I was uh
one of the girls or like there was another girl also lah like I think shahira used to play games a lot also but basically she and I
would sometimes play with like the guys in class cause my classes
B ya
ah ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya the Switch is sort of like a
Taken oh Taken is a pretty good game though I my brother had a then his he had like a bunch of games I'm not sure if they were pirated or not cause like he pirates a lot of stuff not even gonna lie like even my games on my were pirated I think ya but he had like ben ten and like some other few games but I don't I don't remember the rest ya but ya I really I really really like the just because it was so easy to bring around you know ya
basically more or less ah
then
oh shit
ya ya ya correct correct correct
funny story right I the first time I saw Mortal Kombat was when I was like
my first sign of childhood trauma
but
I think so I think he's like the main character in one of them or is it all of them I don't even remember the plot to be honest
mmhmm
ya actually I stopped playing that Tetris game I think cause I got I got
bored of the loading screen cause like to wait for a new match is quite sometime right
quite long right ya so I think I stop playing that I was thinking about getting smashed
kan cause I think
march like it was the start of circuit breaker I think ya so like around march then it's the
I haven't gotten it at all they haven't even confirm no they confirmed my order already but then they never like updated me after that aku rasa dia orang terlupa like I really feel like they forgot about my order but then I like I really keep meaning to email them I always forget in fact I've already ordered another album and I already got that album but like I still don't have the previous album that I ordered
ya so I need to
email them about it cause now they have my thirty dollars
uh it's on Carousell but then like they're an official website they're they're not sketchy lah to be honest they're like quite well-known it's house of K-pop
like email them I guess I don't I don't even know what I should say what should I write in my email
ya they gave me the order number ya
mm I guess so
no no no the signed one got cancelled cause that time two members went on hiatus ya I didn't I ended up not buying that one
ya
that one I only got
I decided to buy two normal versions
ya then I just pre-ordered it orh ya
something
I know right it's so like you kind of question like what they actually do in the army and then like you know sometimes they get the idols to perform also inside the army it's quite entertaining though especially when they like come together oh it's super entertaining
ya ya ya I think so
I don't know maybe
ya
I don't know it's very weird also it's very weird to think that like our friends are going to go to I have some people enlisting in like I have some friends enlisting in
uh
like
what is it they ya they get to get discharged earlier but still it's kinda sad then I can only see them on weekends ya
mm but my closest guy friends haven't gotten it yet though know like set lin hasn't
gotten it
ya ya ya maybe he'll get for april or something maybe that's why they haven't sent out I don't know I don't know how works
forgot his name one of the malay the one that
used to that you saw at Don Don Donki
do you do you know
ah ya ya ya him he and
saz were in what is it called ah infantry in or something ya then that one also is quite
I think it's it's like something like commando but I I don't know what's the difference ah
then you know saz also was like a medic sort of like he he he was really good at doing first aid and stuff then back then when we were doing part time he will explain to me like what to do with different people like for different injuries what you should do what
methods to apply or something ya infant is like the man
orh is it
I don't know I just watch war movies and I watch people die and I I don't really know the like the specifics
ya ya
then they don't have
I think
what I read about was that japan back then lah don't know if it's still like that now like in history um they really train on mental resilience and then like they would they really drive the nationalism into like the soldiers so that's why
like the
uh what do you call it the the one that the people that sacrificed themselves in the warplanes
I think so ya ya then like those pilots they were willing they knew that they were gonna die but they willingly volunteered themselves to like drive drive the plane into the ships ya like because they at the back of the heads they're like yes I would I would love to die for my country cause like for them it's like I think of honour I guess I think singaporean culture doesn't really have that but japanese people I think korean people also ah they are very strong about their honour then like that's even that's also why they taught soldiers how to commit seppuku
ya it's like you start from the right then you left then you go up then like your guts will literally spill out of you ya uh I remember after the war I think after certain battles lah if they lost right they would just commit seppuku and die
ya can you imagine that like
you are so devoted to your country to the point where you would rather die than just
ya than just lose the war it's it's quite intense
ya in general cause I watch so many war movies right war was just terrible man it was terrible for everyone and
a lot of people
I think the saddest parts are when
people die not even cause they were fighting but they were they just got like diseases and stuff I I was watching this story atonement ya then the guy uh
are you are you gonna watch the movie
okay well then the guy died of
septicaemia or something which is basically when like you have a wound then uh there's like bacteria and it infects your wound and then like basically you just
um I don't know ah it just
ya then because of that they just can't breathe or stuff or something ya
ya so he died like that and he died on the last like before the last ship back home
ya it it was really sad lah so when he died and then the wife not the wife but like the girlfriend I guess
um she died too but it was because of
no it was cause of a bombing and then she tried to hide in a train station but cause of the bombing I think it burst some pipe or something and then the whole train station got flooded
ya so that's how she died then so they both died before they met each other again
ya it was a really it was pretty sad lah but I didn't I didn't cry that much I think cause
that wasn't the main message of the story ya but it was pretty sad
it's so realistic to the point where it's not it's not like you know you're not like watching a movie anymore it's like you're really there so that's why it really broke my heart
that's why and he was really trying his best to take care of the sister you know then it's just suay ah the sister ended up dying of malnutrition
a'ah a'ah a'ah
it's not even not even an entree
it happened in nineteen forty two-ish ya
um I think
my mother's generation is like one of the last few
to have experienced effects of the war
a'ah
then um
I think
uh like
and she did she barely took anything with her I think he just took like
some clothes then like her money lor then she just came to singapore I mean
I don't know I don't know how they got the house but ya
it was mm
before the war I think
it was ya it was like a year or two years before the war
that's why I'm glad I'm not though ya
ah ya ya ya it's they they don't even like to acknowledge it lah to be honest and then they I think everyone knows already lah but like they put a lot of money into giving japan this new image and then like you know just showing off their culture and everything ya
but
I think so the magnitude of nine or something ya then my mum was like oh this is
ya it's like karma for what they did during the japanese occupation
ya like I mean sure I guess whatever you believe in but it's still a bit insensitive to say it while it's happening
ya ya correct correct
mm
mm
mm I was watching unsolved mysteries on netflix then they were talking about this one town there also got affected by the
err what do you call it the tsunami ya then um it washed away a lot of people basically and a lot of people that I think in that region alone fifteen thousand people died ya and it wasn't a big town it was maybe their population was
like they didn't know where to go cause they didn't know that they died cause it was all so sudden right then especially taxi drivers whenever they were driving around right err like usually nighttime they will find people who are just like in the middle of nowhere then they need to go they want to go back into the town where the tsunami happen
then like
they will stop
near the town then when they turn back the person is not there anymore
ya
something like that it's it's I guess it's kind of a spin off version of buddhism not not to say it's like not to be disrespectful it's just that it's something like that ya
uh huh
ah ah ah
ya
ah ya it was in
in two thousand three ya ya
I
like the whole
I don't know how I don't know what you call it I guess town ya and after that a lot of people have like trauma of just even showering
a lot of people lost their my parents their grandparents then you know like if even like you can't even retrieve
your
serious
like he got pulled in to the water ya then I think I don't know ah maybe the mother ran in after him a
ya but I know that I think they died ya
it's pretty sad lah that's why it's quite fortunate that we live in singapore like okay there are a lot of cons also but at least we don't we really are quite safe from
uh natural disasters
ya
ah
that's so creepy
eww
there's like similar stories about this in the basically like they people move into new houses right then you know houses in the are freaking huge like if you watch renovation stories right dude their basements are the size of like a flat you know and that's just one floor and it's the bottom floor so their attics they also have like attics and stuff then got stories of people they just move in and then they hear like like I don't know lah footsteps around the house right then usually I think people would usually think like a ghost or something then but then they they wouldn't believe it lah so they think oh maybe just the pipes or something but then people find out that there are like people living in their attics and when they're not awake or something they'll go down and then they'll eat from their fridge or something then they'll go back up into the attic to hide ya then I remember one girl she was showering or something then she heard the person climb down ya then I don't know ah I don't know how it happened but she managed to call the police then the police arrested the guy
ya then I think the guy was living in her attic for what ah year ya a year since she moved in and she didn't notice at all like that's so creepy I cannot imagine having just this random person
in your house like don't don't even know what he's doing
actually ya actually ya ya ya ya ya but in a more
ya less um murdery kind of way
it's so insane I cannot stand away you can do you know what what higher speed said I cannot sit cross country and no lah I mean
I don't know lah I mean
mm I guess has to do with like their amendments and stuff ya
mm
ya I can't imagine people our age voting a lot of people I know didn't even keep up with the
like parties and stuff ya I mean it's not bad lah it's just that it's not necessary you know I think it will only work in
countries like america I kings or like okay lah maybe it will only work for work in favour for her talent like other workers party basically any party that's not P P
I guess or like okay lah maybe it will only work for work in favour for the I don't know worker's party basically any party that's not
cause
mm
I think
then they moved to a zone
that was under
was it a worker's party or another party lah like you can tell that the residents residences are different like the way they are decorated ah like it's very different and then I think it's like the one
mm
true
I don't know I mean my friend is taking political science now so by the time I can vote I'm just I'm just gonna ask everything then I'll follow her her guidance we live in the same also like she lives what
two blocks away from me ya so I'm just gonna trust her instinct
it is it is ya actually got her she did she got her first essay back already she did really well she most people she said most people only got a B for that paper then she got then only three people like their professor gave an A then she got an A minus then she was so happy I'm so proud of her
I think it was about karl marx and just his communism idea ya
ya no really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had to write a whole essay about it like two thousand words
ya
ah but nah uni sounds so exciting can't wait to do stuff like that
dude I cannot believe it and she's like the one of the youngest ah ya
like some went to uh most of them went to ah like some into ireland like dublin ya then some of them went to australia some of them went to the ya
ah ya
ya exactly like you can't even guarantee that you'll get into the olympics
like ugh

it was so cold in the morning
then then second day is it you all three days you just relax at the hotel
mm

mm
oh so when you went it's just messy lah is it

it's nice to go out with your family and staycay lah
what
mm
yeh so one night is you go weekday one night already what five hundred ah no
wah so expensive
oof

this staycay in Singapore quite fun lah especially when you go with family or friends
yeah
eh why you never apply for like Coffee Bean
then
then
oh never got reply ah
oo my friend got Coffee Bean then I like uh I hear I hear her pay like I wanna work there too
if you reach a certain amount of hours per week you get ten dollar per hour but I think she might hear wrong lah she might hear wrong what that's why I scared
yeah but okay lah she like becoming one next week like she's taking the health basic health hygiene whatever thing
November oh my god this week got like tick-tock September October you got like nearly two months man
oh very long eh
home bum because you got no work is it
it's not like you're not trying to find what you tried but a lot of jobs like
they never reply or they got different criteria than you expect
kan
mm
yeah they ask a lot of jobs they asking for like for like three years eh err like at least a year experience then I'm like I haven't even start a job then you want a year experience a bit too much sia
yeah
what to do
yeah
is it
is it I never check like jobs right now
mm
yeah that's why
what to do
you got play Among Us
you know there's this game called Among Us
can ask like
yeah
but like it looks so fun right but I cannot lie I can't I I cannot lie everytime I lie they like okay it's Nisha it's Nisha I'm like oh no okay yeah it's me it's me just just kill me already
mm
mm
mm
yeah
mm
mm
what
you can hide the body
wah
I didn't know you can hide the body wah I should I should try
mm
then so many people there right I just kill someone then everyone was like who who would kill someone in front of broad daylight when everyone's here then I just keep quiet
both especially with the plus four plus two
stupid games eh ya
is it all meat or is it just err beef
wah
I mean I know I know you can but you just prefer not to right
yeah but it'd be so random imagine your guy like knows that you don't you don't like beef then one day you just craving for beef
mm mm mm
I was trying to make sense of your sentence then I'm like uh err huh
yeah
mmhmm
that is like no helping buddy like that right no buddy system
mm
they're waiting for you
but you also not interested then they like okay sorry guys next time
then
sometimes I also like that lah but but most of the time when they know then they will change but if they don't know then they don't change and then when they don't when they know you do't go then they stay to the original plan lah
hmm
mm
mm
yeah that's why it's like it's worse I mean would they like it when when I say that oh we eat this one later we we specifically find food for you like like you like left out you know that kind of feeling
then then that's why that's why I keep like distancing from a certain group of people in poly
mm
mm
yeah
eh
four five times as in like to and fro back or what
wah
then next week just take bus all the way later I like I don't really
yeah I'm your guinea pig now ah
and then Natalie idea did you read Natalie's the that thing
I I did the survey but I didn't see the point of having one
I think
I think that will be more useful lah in my cause like they only have disability for what the one that we know so far is a wheelchair only
you never actually heard of other disability kind I think that will be more helpful if they research in that lah
mm
mm
mm
that's why they probaby don't get on the bus they probably take taxi kan
um I mean hmm continue you continue first continue first
no no you finish your sentence first ah
mm
then other than that a lot of people also cannot afford having that kind of help what
cause it is expensive to have a trained dog
uh mm
yeah the yeah
yeah uh huh
mm
mm
yeah like I feel like we should cater our technology more towards the disabled lah
convenience right
mm
yeah cause they had lost one of their senses you know err not one maybe like some it's very sad lah
mm
yeah
have you heard
I mean I I wish we are smart and got money to do this thing
have you heard of the of the of the forest fire in California is it California or Oregon ah
it's constant like even in this in the morning is red colour then like it's so bad this isn't the first time that happen this is the second time that happen cause of a gender reveal thing
exactly like okay lah you want do gender reveal party it's okay I think I think it's a cute idea to have a party like that but if you wanna make an explosion in the middle of like flammable things it's a bit no brainer lah that one
yeah then like can you the the the thing is right the family already have children
then they exposed them to this kind of this this kind of stupidity
yeah lah
really
oh man you should ask cause I think it will damn funny
I didn't know
hmm
oh boy is a girl joke lah
rated
mm
yeah it's like so isn't it like betting like you betting is actually a betting it's like just a party kind of thing it's like a party idea
a blessing right
hmm
yeah yeah yeah
yeah man funny lah
my own shift yeah

Ethelene and Kelly I was so shocked

is I will take two separate room
at least they can spend the night together
there
oh they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay lah
let's see the photos
Amara
huh got no plate
Maggi
because like how mah want to
shower right
like quite difficult
but two bedroom okay lah ilham can sleep outside
ya
this one oh okay dah I think this is the one that I wanted to take
angah don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
okay this one is for three adults right
they can sleep
on the floor lah of course lah with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that lah as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast

I guess
I were I I'm in that kind of mood

ya
because it's every tourist attraction place right
ya ya ya ya I think he will appreciate now at this age
oh ya hor
mm)(mm)(mm
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward lah but I think he
I think he don't mind
no eh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why ah why you don't like it
oh is it
what did you have
a a what
oh
mm okay lah I will decide
oh ya ya ya
mm
I also have it every month
on the itinerary
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that um indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
is like a bit weird lah so when I taste it eh I thought that it's going to be bad but then like oh my god it's so nice
err I ate the prawn green curry you the naan
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we uh we
mm it's too loud mm
because we we passed by and then after that we thought eh
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay lah
and then I don't really like udon
that's why maybe I don't mm
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
err okay lah I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like uh
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar tau for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
naan
okay lah it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay wow I I I don't ever have
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
mm mm mm
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm
ya
mm
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in bali remember the the Yoshinoya
the yakiniku beef
is it the same thing
ah
but then that one the one that I ate also called yakiniku beef why
oh wait
maybe maybe maybe
oh is it
mm
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose mee soto
oh okay
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know what
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like um
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it lah
of course right
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
oh but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity ah rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like oh my god oh my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the wayi can just like err can I
ya can I just like err take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
err helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room uh house is like seven million
err with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets err attached uh with uh indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
scary siol
I don't think I can
don't ah
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
ugh
mmhmm
and then they put there as a meme
okay oh ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
buy one get one free
oh you mean like okay okay I don't know
hmm
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
ah okay then that kind of deal like okay lah meh I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay lah maybe that one is a bit worse
like huh one for one
but I don't get to choose
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
standard lah
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body ah
ha
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like ugh
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like uh
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things lah maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
err
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients eh no no no uh like he or she is not wrong
and everything like that and then
ah I like like ya I like uh true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news oh I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are um
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
uh or like paranormal activity all these like
um uh cable uh ya
a good movie correct
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
err ya ya ya
ya
mm
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what ah
ah chris watts ah is it the chris watts
the one that she the one that the the
ya the one that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
um
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can uh on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay lah maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix one eh
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
uh I mean he's a narcissist what uh eventually he will just gonna act that oh no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
about two months prior prior to the wedding eh prior to the murder sorry
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
err the girlfriend lah but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious lah
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like um
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle lah like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like uh grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the one that
I had after I had
aryan after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
uh healthy okay lah healthy is subjective lah
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
this
take care of you when you are young kan so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
err they need I have to
do it
for them
ah and then my third wish actually
uh I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still uh I'm already pretty
oh I
err when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
err uh um lower secondary
then I think
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head kan I will actually really think like then I was like eh like quite sad lah like
they are somebody's
err
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya
ya and then after that you are at the risk also because maybe you know
so it's quite sad lah
ya
you have any wishes
ya man
ya man
because my my
you think what
that's why why is he even the president
oi
baby love
no more new K says
ya
at sembawang
mmhmm
so could you
huh
who
oh is it
wait your workplace got intern
like
and the community centre
ya they actually intern
what what do the intern do what what course is he from
why you met you gift
ha
okay ya
ya
ya I mean why you do you want to be there for your intership like what would you gain or
what could you possibly not learn from before that you know at school
that's weird
hmm
ah
there's there's
is it the same as our here is that how you all sit at
mm
mm
mm
to um
mm
mm
they just go there to like see whether like oh like everything like ah okay I go lah and ask
mm
they'll go
oh is it
mm mm mm mm
to
ya
then you turn around then you see that eh you know like
um
huh
ya
it's not at can I take it out
huh
you go ah
ya
then you call in then you should call in to first and ask what what what they can do
you know like say help aryan aryan
correct correct you can definitely uh look up
unless if you cannot find whatever that you're you you want to know online then no choice ah you need to go down what
and then if your mum
you know like cannot go down you go down first lah like check it out for her what's the problem
that some some people just think that we actually don't want to help them
you know because like we want to do the easy way out
but actually we really cannot help
don't want change colour
ah
oh okay
mm
huh
nothing to do with race what
eww aryan
but that time you say you want interview right
eh
Ministry of Manpower
for
wait what sorry for the that what position
oh
what what what what will you do if you get the job like what will you do
dormitory
ah okay okay
mm mm mm mm mm
why
oh is it
but then the pay is is the same ah
as
that one higher ah
november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
err actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation lor
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya lah I pass
so
you know that day I went for uh a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
and white lodge is um
it's a private uh institution
ya it's a private err it's a private school lah it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's uh it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge um
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in ah okay like the the one I went I went uh from eight thirty to one
I have to err assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates lah but they are they are like
one teacher err to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then um
after that the okay so what I did was like uh
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
um I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children lah um okay the first half the eight thirty to
um
for kids that uh the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
ang moh
and then mixed race like japanese and ang moh
like um japanese and japanese korean and uh sweden
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local one
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international uh so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
orh ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
eight thirty to five lah
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because uh if you go under government
saturday you're uh open half day
then you need to alternate working ah
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this one like saturday sunday you are closed and then what I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower lah
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see uh what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
colourful
colourful characters lah like
err and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the uh
they call me they call me miss
hu
because they don't my my name is very long right then like uh okay never mind uh just okay just call me miss hu
okay then after that they
oh got one kid say uh miss hu can I go to the toilet please
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
um can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like whoa eh
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
go to school on that day right
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so ah
a'ah
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this uh one um one
uh no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
uh one kid is err
ya
half german half japanese so
um
tell us like okay uh
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like uh and then the kids will like orh then they will uh
uh
attempt to attempt to say the language also lah
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because uh the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys lah girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their naptime uh they uh then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
mm
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already dah
feed breakfast lah
they have like a snack lah like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that uh doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one kan
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later lah
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
err when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring lah
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no uh you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like oh my god uh and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before

hey how are you
almost two months ago
kan
you were having your assignment but then I was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
mmhmm
a'ah seh
ah sia like a blessing in disguise ah eh
okay lah
you heard
but
I was not as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now lah but um you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done ah
ya actually I am most of the time only like err two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
cause there are some like letters from err the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time lah
a few hours at least
in a week
ya lah I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
mm
huh as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
oh my gosh
mm
ya I know you always do lah you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere lah
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
oh
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you ah like I stress eat also most of the time I think I think it's not just us
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age um
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one um app away or one call away so
mm
is it I never heard of that before
mmhmm
oh my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
oh
mmhmm
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
uh huh
ya
mmhmm
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good ah
as cliche as it sounds lah
um healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my err to get my workout in ah on a daily
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it ah
ya
mmhmm
oh is it
mmhmm
what's the average ah what's the ideal
that's normal ah ah
that plays a part ah
ya mm
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
mm
ya lah it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more um you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad what I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face sial babe
oh no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
I've always like you you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
okay lah
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on lah
it's like that
ya
oh yes it's right there
you know me too well
how how long have we known each other
primary school yes no no no
is it eh is it K one or nursery eh
err K
there seven
oh
primary five eh
primary five ya
oh my gosh wait primary five
and then now we are like oh my god turning thirty next year so how how how many years
I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
even during school we don't really talk to each other kan
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
mmhmm
ah
mmhmm
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
mm
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know um from what you're telling me
like
the effort
is only at your end
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times lah but
you know like um in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow that really open up like
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay lah um being in a relationship of friends ah like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this um saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like err people come and go
and especially when the err when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men lah but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women eh I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay um you know
um you shouldn't get back to your err to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly kan err maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my no not experience lah but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense ah I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up ah
mm
mm
aww
aww so cute
a book like a diary
oh right okay
oh my gosh
eh but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
eh that is actually a good thing like um it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know um on paper
mm
then it hit you ah
ya you I mean I know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like um
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
um
mm
mm
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up ah then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
oh my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
mm
ya lah like I said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up eh not not the cause of your okay lah somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay lah I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya lah but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
aww
wow you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
eh oh my gosh
I mean
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly eh when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
err it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead lah it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on err cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay lah
you know
but err do you know if he's attached now or not
oh my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
oh is it
ya I don't give a shit anymore sia I can't even remember
eh isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah um let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
eh you don't don't say that about yourself lah you are amazing
mm mm
oh my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
eh ya oh my god I almost forgot about our makisan
okay to be fair I'm like facing the other side of the room now so I can't really see that it's like
ya we only have one minute ya it is a breeze man
easy breezy I don't mind
like different topics every time
this is this has been an enjoyable voice recording session engaging

I don't know I mean I've been
err looking at
err design ya design err I think recently lah I just picked up like err cause err

my mind yes uh ya say can say so

err there's this cafe I think err
there's this shop I think called squisito ah ya they got some italian pasta all that like my favorite ah
ah that's why that's true also lah that's why
ya make reservations lah
ya but so far then maybe apart from that
I will just err
uh
ah ya they did err I recently when I went they had this
position lah ya like two people
ya ya they block the seats ah ya so err okay lah I mean like you you I I
then like
mm
ya ya ya I know

mm
mm what
one thing that make me annoyed ah
that's why so it's not easy mah
mm
ya correct correct

mm
ya true lah
I see
ya understand

mm ya ya
so like
mm
is there any of your oldest
the the longest I mean how to say err
like
mm
oh
mm
orh
I see nice nice ya I mean for now I'm also having
like I still keep in contact with my secondary school friends lah let's see my primary school
my primary school
my primary school friends
my primary school friends err it's like err
they are not
they are not
err in contact with me much because they
they are quite busy with their own lifestyle already then I also not that close now with them
ya
ya we keep in touch lah like of course ah like we go jamming and all
lah together so like ever since then
ya we still
ya we're still close lah
ya we also ah
mm
ya
ya ya ya like like
I ask hi how are they going
so ya sometimes it's good to ask lah how they are doing
so ya
mm
mm mm no lah
mm mm
ya
I see a'ah
opposite err not really I'm a very dynamic
I have a dynamic taste in music lah okay
I think cause sometimes I like loud music but sometimes also like like like indie also
ya introvert
ya sometimes loud music helps you destress mm so I decided and also
ya it's like
err emotional ah ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
just
lah
ah service ah
ya
so uh huh
struck an idea that that
ya so uh this is one way lah we can
err bring
bring it up
to them ya so
mm venture
I think
uh about
and
and stuff we are
err more more in depth
for the meantime so
ya I'll just use this opportunity lah kan
mm
ya I can see
err physically so we must monitor them by whatsapp or like ya like to liaise err with my contacts over there lah
uh ya
I think that's mainly what the the difficulties are the rest not so much
ya
ya
no lah I have a few a few friends they are doing it together with me ya
ya
one of them is not is a housewife lah so she she's just doing some side business also then ya so she's also doing this lah then for me and my other friend we are like working full time
ya so ya like ya this is like our part time lah time management so far okay
try to err minimise our workload lah
mm from day to day
ya
but uh I think it's okay lah it's a feasible business I think ah what about you like do you have anything like you want to start up with
or mm
mm
mm oh
nice orh nice
uh huh
mm mm ya lah ya lah
ya hopefully lah
hopefully
ya
a'ah
mm ya ya
opportunity for us
mm
kan
okay
ya honeymoon mm maybe consider ya
like that but actually err can say I'm more of a sightseeing kind of person lah
ya
I think
mm
ah ya that's way road trip yes
ya so
so
it's it's good lah to bring them
err better I mean
ah
ah okay lah interesting
ya
mm mm ah ya lah
it's it's nice to travel with parents because
ya
so like you like to go travel like so
like what's your favorite season ah mmhmm
mm
mm
I see actually no I mean
err spring is considered err winter right or is it after winter sorry kan ya but I I mean I personally also like winter lah
but err winter like it's very fun lah cause
aesthetically I would prefer err autumn
ya like the beautiful scenery of the autumn leaves like it's it's really nice lah ya
mm ya correct
mmhmm ya ya is like
once the this is all over kan
mm like you really mm
wow
it was it was actually during autumn lah that's when ya I got to experience autumn
ya
they are very err
friendly also and then I I also like every time you go to like seven eleven or any convenience store they always greet you one without fail ya so that's one thing I like admire lah about them
then so ya singapore err ya correct
ya basic courtesy obviously manners ya ya lah but I guess japanese people are just born or they are taught that way lah right
since young so
that's why
ah then orh
there's the bullet train lah ya the high speed train all
no I only took the high speed train only
because because I couldn't afford the no lah I feel that I I because the destination I'm going doesn't require me to take the high the bullet train lah it's just the high speed train which
like normal lah I I mean it's quite fast when you're inside it it's quite fast I think travelling about three hundred plus kilometer per hour ya
but you already like when you're inside you don't really feel anything
ya like ya
which is not bad good ya but
like you said it's quite expensive it's uh the food
really
mm ya sure can I can bring you like there ya I mean there's I mean I've not been to all the places what so I also like keen to go visit all the other places
in japan

okay if were me I won't say anything but I will go down to the reception can you give us another room after the first night
oh oh oh
orh okay okay
yes cause I I my mum okay I he this person works as the receptionist the bell the bell worker or something like that so he was the one who were assigned rooms to the guests
so he said usually
he did mention the highest I don't know whether this one story where the highest level or one of the top levels they closed it off
they don't let anybody in
ya but basically this guy was saying this guy was saying ah
uh no he didn't say the top ten floors he just say one of the high floors they closed it up cause of there's a lot of incidents where people encounters uh but
so I think you were the unlucky one
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
uh huh
I have to go home later
and your house is freaking temple beside and with like a freaking you know the the temple I oh
it doesn't make me feel better it doesn't
uh
okay I mean like I guess I'm gonna take Grab later
to the
I can feel it when you were mentioning that you had no neighbours
and then you could hear children laughing and all that
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I wouldn't want to go back with that story
creepy seh
okay
I did that I did that um
I did that uh what happened was when in korea I actually encounter some things supernatural so I actually recite the quran ya
I experience
uh huh uh huh yes
yes yes
wah
crazy man

oh it's okay um jurong and woodlands not very near also what
oh what bus was it ah
mm
not bad I don't think I ever took one eight seven before sia
like the only bus I will take
to go jurong is eh
I don't know honestly I don't know
um yeah I mean I go to school like I study in jurong right okay technically not jurong lah clementi
but usually like I take and bus
but then there isn't like a direct bus to my school so that kind of sucks yeah
ah yeah correct I take the train from marsiling
to clementi then I take one eight four
yeah it's pretty tiring honestly everytime I sit I get so annoyed because like there's so many people on the bus and they're all just squeezing to get a seat ugh
yeah especially like before COVID right at least now with COVID everyone like social distance and the bus isn't so crowded right but like
honestly like I also now everytime I went to school
I'm kind of glad now that it's not so crowded but I do hate the fact that COVID exists
I feel like oh it's just so tiring you take more energy trying to breathe then like
walking around or running around
yeah honestly like our friendship is damn low maintenance ah like we took
we haven't been out with each other in like what a year
like honestly the last time we went out that was memorable was us going to LANY
and that was fun I'm quite upset that this year there's no more concerts
um
all because of COVID is really damn irritating especially when it comes to like
school oh yeah you know I was supposed to go on a holiday in june to New Zealand
like dude that's one of the best countries
ever eh like honestly but we couldn't even go and the thing is
hey loser
mm
oh my god I miss malaysia Ramly burger
yeah like the vibes at night is just different like last time ah when me and my dad
when we went there when me and my whole family used to go right then my dad will always go to this one particular guy his name was like azan or something
we can't even go there and the thing is we don't even know if he still has a business which is so sad
some people like they their only form of income is like all these businesses
but honestly if you think about it right if I stay in malaysia I'll be having so much fun right now
because like malaysia is so big you can already travel from jurong jurong eh
johor bahru to and where can we go in singapore jurong to tampines
like what the heck so boring
I thought like the best part of living in malaysia would be because like you can go from one place to another
but that's not the case
mm
what
what so the police like
hmm
yeah honestly indonesians have the funniest humour from what I see on Twitter they always say like
when usually people have the worst humour like if somebody go to their house and scare them they would like laugh and stuff right
cause the COVID situation is not so bad but I still miss school
like ugh it's so hard to focus in class you know because it's all online
but I have one exam coming this thursday and I'm so scared cause I have barely studied
yeah I was thinking that exams would be online which would suck
you must go to campus but you have like a lot of precautions to follow you must like
key in your temperature like on the school website lah then like you must at the entrance you must show like this specific lanyard thing that you must have to enter the campus and all then ah
so it's like one class per classroom then the exam is there
exam like seriousness of an exam so it's very hard for me to focus like I had an exam a few
like two weeks ago
I don't know just not used to it you know like wearing a mask and then it's just so uncomfortable
for me ah yeah because
I don't know my course don't really have a lot to do with like online stuff or like
so honestly I cannot imagine having the exam on laptop cause I think that would be super stressful but
I don't know I guess you have to experience to know how is your O level preparation going
I I don't know if I read the article correctly I never really read lah I just saw the headlines it's like eh extended
oh right that's true oh I forgot okay anyway
ah fun fact I dropped in sec three
cause I sucked at I was so bad at it
and the thing is it's ironic cause you know how they say malays can't do math right
yeah but then I did well for maths but I can't do well for which is damn funny honestly
actually that's true I wonder is like because all my friends right they say they are more motivated at home
and your school life is hard because you are in the same place what at least last time like
so hopefully the bell curve isn't higher only everyone is faces situation as you like the oh I cannot study I'm stress kind of thing
but I don't know I wouldn't want to go through O levels ever again
I always tell myself like oh I'm going to be better I really hope so
and like
yeah
hais I just want COVID to be over it has caused so many problems
hopefully
oh well yesterday ah like I said I always stay at home right so basically yesterday I was staying at home but mostly I was studying
um
since I'm so used to right I stopped writing physical notes
and like honestly I find that it helps me to be more productive
so in a way I think
it did help me overall like
realise what studying methods help me more
so that's basically what I did yesterday how about you
mm
a'ah
um malayan council eh what you eat there
honestly I don't know I haven't gone to like arab street in so long and I just like
I miss the atmosphere that it was before COVID you know
first time we ever went we were like so surprised by the prices like
malayan council legit like damn expensive but I think like
it's like quite serata yeah it's like the
price of the food and the taste of the food and the quality it's all matches up quite well lah it's just that
I don't know I just feel like it's a food that you eat every once in a while you know
no I've never tried before what does it um what does it eh what does it sell
wow that one sounds nice eh honestly I love Indomie
Indomie is so good must be you can't go wrong with Maggi so basically like indobowl just sells like
let's just say how to say high quality indomie is it
but I think like recently I went there like
well honestly
like I keep using this app called fast jobs and I like tried to find all these different different
um positions and the thing is they always say like oh urgent hiring
you say that it's urgent you say that you need people but why do you like not get back to people I don't understand
I think I applied for over like what twenty jobs already and like most didn't get back to me
honestly my last few
like jobs that I've applied for was like Starbucks Coffee Bean like to be honest
if I do get the job I get better at it you know that kind of thing how about you what kind of jobs did you apply for
they never properly advertise what will be in need for the job
I myself don't like it also
like job postings and all but it's like okay
look through every single one I apply for like ten
why do you post the job if like you're not going to get back to people you know I know you're busy and all but the least you can do is like
mm
it's like I applied for Bath and Body Works recently
then they said like we'll get back to you in a week if you're shortlisted
why if I'm shortlisted what if I don't get the job can you at least tell me also because like
but then it's just like really just waiting and waiting and waiting and obviously you don't want to like
make things harder for yourself by applying for other jobs or waiting for another job to get back to you
so I understand your frustration lah like do I apply for this
but like what if the other job accepts me then I cannot take this job
and then it will just make their lives harder
but they don't even think about us they don't even tell us
like honestly I would prefer getting a you're rejected letter rather than just like nothing at all you know
I rather like also know why I didn't get the job that kind of thing it would be nice to know
so that like you can improve yourself and stuff like that but
I don't know how the working world works cause I'm only eighteen but I guess we'll see in the future
hopefully honestly like during this like you know like circuit breaker period
I honestly ordered a lot of things online because like honestly I thought about it I thought like
okay once COVID ends I can get a job and my holidays start it will be so easy for me to like
pay back all the money that I wasted during the holidays
but no I got it all wrong I thought COVID
COVID is still here and it's like
so it's like all these new clothes that I wear for what honestly
mm mm
yeah honestly like when the virus started in china I was like damn that is disgusting
I was thinking that oh they already contained it what like it was from wuhan and like they already closed up wuhan and everything and I thought that it wouldn't like suddenly
like everything happened so fast like we were just living our life as per normal
like of course it won't hit singapore
how to say ungrateful for their position they are the biggest they are like
one of the biggest country in the world but like
their management is so bad like look at their president it's a stupid idiot named donald trump
mm
hmm
you will look up your president what right
because technically like so many people voted him in to the office and all and like
and it's like
the mayors even have to step in just to uh make up for his mistakes like he should know that as a president
he has a lot of power and like everything he says will be taken seriously right everybody no matter how dumb or stupid like they are
it's just like normal to listen to your president what because they are like the head like in power and all so yeah
mm mm
mmhmm
hmm
there are still people who are saying that they will vote him for the next election when he has already
proven so many times that he is inadequate for the country
like why you so dumb ugh anyway let's stop talking about this stupid idiot
eh guess who texted me
this guy from like okay okay so
so like you know I'm super bored during school and all
so then like I started using OkCupid
then like I talked to a bunch of guys lah because I think I'm quite pretty
then like this guy
he's not very honestly he's like err tall
then like okay lah like good looking not bad not bad you know
then he damn funny sia then he ask me like stupid stupid malay jokes okay okay wait let me tell you one malay joke
yeah it's stupid right but like he was one of the first few matches that like make me laugh you know
he's like eighteen years old which is my age honestly actually I don't really date guys my age ah
so like yeah honestly we clicked
not bad sia so far like I don't know I'm quite
interested
err oh his name is bukhari
and like honestly that's a super like old school name like honestly I feel like my
but like I don't know he's not bad and he's tall okay ah not like
uh yeah I'm thinking about hudy who is one six three that stupid idiot of a boy
honestly like I'm so upset that he kind of ghosted me
okay I wouldn't say that we were vibing but at least like I was talking to him and he was talking to me and it's just
actually
one day and a few hours honestly if I
think I swipe a lot already sia and I think like my taste
not so picky so like I got like
then like honestly most of them are quite interesting but like most of them just say
hi
yo
like boring seh like can you be more interesting please
drummer name his daughters
I don't know
eh that's quite funny eh I like how he made a joke with your name inside
you know that kind of thing yeah
facts honestly but um
so they like put in more effort to like talk to everybody and stuff
eh wait wait wait wait how is Bumble
oh
swipe then if it works out on each other then match
why got like twenty four hour expiry date all so funny eh
yeah honestly and I'm so sad about malaysia extending their thing
I know we talked about it just now but you just reminded me cause I don't know how many foreigners there are
and I really just want to go to malaysia I want to eat my korean barbeque
three to one conversion rate
ah seh I just miss going there lah I remember like everytime we go we will try this place called dolly dim sum have you tried before
but they have the salted egg yolk dim sum and it's like
it's perfect I swear
mm
oh my god I love pepper lunch so much and I miss pepper lunch
yeah it was damn funny right it was like I think I texted you like we were texting right saying that we were also at the same place or something oh no
like I was on the fourth floor you were like on the third floor at Starbucks kan
why I yeah you talking about wedding reminds me
like honestly I just miss the wedding food and the atmosphere it's so fun like cause you know I'm in a mixed family right
so usually our wedding is like for the
ah like my mum
ah side she loves taking like she loves the indian culture
so it's like yeah we're not mixed per say
but like because like our ancestors like got some
some blood and all so like we also like proclaim lah but actually we're not mixed
full malay like you
I was so lucky that like my aunt she managed to get married this year
in february like right before like COVID became a worser disaster
mmhmm
yeah honestly you know like I saw this one guy you know a son of a peach on Instagram
mm
right honestly I didn't know it was a thing but apparently it is eh
mm mm
I think
you know how like malay families always say like oh it's for your image for our reputation as a family that's not how you should see it pe in the end
like you're marrying someone is like your happiness so everything should go the way that you want it to go you know
I also like in the future like when I get married my mom and dad will be like cool to like break the traditional stereotype and let me do what like I am happy with ah
mm
mm mm
hmm
actually that's true actually that would be goals ah like
then like in the future they ended up having the wedding at the same place at the same day and that thing cause they plan together kan
I
think no got anne hathaway I remember got anne hathaway mm but it was a good movie ah then I always think about it like
wedding book but I find it like a bit tacky lah like imagine if like somebody find then they will judge me you know like she's like eighteen and she has a wedding book
yeah honestly like
to me when I think about the future I always want like to be special you know like
okay you compare like uh prices of cars in singapore to prices of cars in
you can get a car in for like what
like forty thousand and then in singapore the same car will cost like hundred thousand something with C
so it's like I don't know ah like you think about it you can have all these dreams and aspirations but like
so much to think about in the future and I'm honestly very stressed
like I remember I went to Australia and I was in sec one then after that we went to where is it gold coast
then we got to pass by like this
err university university of queensland
then like from then I told myself like oh I'm going to work really hard to like get into a local like an overseas uni
so lonely because now we're so used to like the big family gathering
so it's like really a lot of to think about I just hope that like
in the future you now is now is with like global warming and all
like I'm just scared that like
is there even any world to live for
yeah that's true that's why like I'm always grateful that I live in
singapore but I don't know it's really just a lot to think about in the future and like what is important to you
I don't how I'm going to teach that child malay
you know I'll still want my children to learn and all cause I feel like it's important
later become like you know the swastika language is it
like is it swastika
I forgot what not ah swahili
or something yeah honestly right that language has become obsolete
oh sanskrit sanskrit
al like it's really gone
like nobody even speaks it anymore nobody knows how to write it and that kind of thing so like
so it's like yeah thinking about that kind of scary
mm
mm
mm

mm just rerun of friends and big bang theory
mm not yet why is it good what is it about
sounds like a good show leh
maybe I give it a shot
what else do you think about often black
okay thanks
I see about that
okay ah thanks
uh by the way uh what do you think I should prepare now while waiting for a full time job
okay I guess I'll prepared that where do I find this kind of sample
okay sure then if I prepare interview outfit what do I need to wear blazer and tie
okay
maybe I'll try find
thanks but
ya lah hopefully something will turn up lah after the after all the application
o
okay lah okay I take note oh ya by the way then that time uh besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix uh what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a show
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
oh ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see uh who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated uh hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and raquel finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my ah two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or
okay maybe I check that out ah but are you buying anything
eh
oh serious ah are you buying
oh ya then uh alesya belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
huh but azam isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay lah if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase ah
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what oh
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it lah I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true lah degree is important I'll think about it lah
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just uh rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree uh sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in uh in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored lah
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company ah I mean
uh usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he uh when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with uh a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
uh he is under maintenance side and technician uh if I'm not wrong uh under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know lah
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know lah I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as uh prison warden ya uh he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
uh the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace uh at just besides changi prison so
in a way beneficial for him lah don't need to stress about you know buying bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place ah for him
if I'm not wrong ah
oh uh he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent uh not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they uh they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy flats but then uh they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the they they bought if I'm not wrong lah
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years ah that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then uh she told me about the benefit uh when she just join full time they even uh give you uh benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even uh
another friend of mine uh she works at adventure if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new khatib home ya she told me about it
they also provide err you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct lah but and all ya
err adventure no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of uh fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company eh not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that err
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya lah just help me out if I need
fourth december he
uh fourth december ha
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
uh she told me err what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because uh she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated oh she also she also has degree by the way
uh chemical chemical science meaning I think err
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya uh right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while lah ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like jurong island that kind of thing that share more of like
uh exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from if I'm not wrong
ya
okay lah anyway
my bike what what you mean
mm my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
ah that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
uh tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation oh my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two it became
up to four so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
his job is basically ah what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now ah ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
um maybe lah I guess see how
I mean first choice would be
second then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same lah but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small uh company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me lah
oh ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
uh engineer but ya lah I mean wouldn't uh wouldn't know if the company needs or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
uh if you want to you can so ya when I heard he
it's just another few more hours so okay what
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
mmhmm
oh ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
huh I thought it's under your name
uh there are demo too young because
oh
ha chain
chain adjust
oh
alamak
oh that time he ask me err he he asked me that uh how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
so I told him like roughly lah how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as uh much more than his monthly but I told him lah
I told him ah that time I I hit about uh four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked ah my pay
was higher than him then tell him lah but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him lah the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him lah to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him lah
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure lah because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
then I told him lah
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him ah I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it lah
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
err
then he was he was shocked lah I say no lah because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked lah he he he judge but whatever lah I mean
I mean you just want to try try only what then and then I told him lah
like it's all up to individual lah I mean all
I I tell him what all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
uh I told him uh
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face lah
uh was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
roo is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket uh add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable lah because
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
oh okay lah maybe I see about that
but okay lah I mean I wouldn't complain already lah I mean as long as the market is good already lah because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
uh now uh based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to hougang mall
plain clothes the act like they are but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I uh she she ride but she put under but err bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her lah ah they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me lah what's the logic behind this grab enforcers oh I mean I'm working what but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say lah like
oh is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair what I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly ah wah that sucks
okay I'll take note lah

mariam
ya
cause I want to make
I want to make brownies but I don't know how
what do you add
flour I put flour baking powder
eh no I don't put baking powder I put sugar the brown sugar

a'ah
okay lah but eighteen dollar
ya like my one eighty four
ya that's why
oh eh fadreena

fudge
so let's hear what's what's your tea on her
mm
mm
ya she has a boyfriend
ya the fuck but the the boyfriend quite uh handsome though but then like why are you bringing your boyfriend into this he's not a part of it also
oh
ya but she do two K though I saw I saw
ya but I feel like same
a'ah
ya that's why
if only wah
oh ya by the way you know rachel got new boyfriend already right
ya oh you met him in real life already ah
uh the ex is our age but she looks twenty five
weird lah sia
ya
uh mm true
did you see the shoes that he buy her the three hundred dollar one
ya
ya eh you know about the olivero also right
he he weird he cannot move on over the fact that rachel already got new and better guy
do you are you in
ya and his wedding is supposed to be this month leh august eh that's why I was like the fuck
ya
did you see his close friends the latest one
his soon to be wife
then what about your friend the toxic another one
a movie
mmhmm
for me ah cause to be honest you told me about her ex right like the ex cheat on her then always use her money all these then like why would you want to be with someone like that some more certis cisco you know it's not a stable job you earn a lot of money only cause you um and is very the timetable very rabak so if you date someone like that you can only go out with them at night like that
and most of their days is very busy what so I'm like just go for the guy lah he seems like a better choice but then if she really cannot wait for two years then I feel like she should just let go of the guy cause he deserves better imagine you with someone then you keep on thinking why I have to go through this again bastard sia the guy can could've find someone better what
then
what she want to do now
it's a new relationship and you already keep arguing like that it's a red flag though just tell her to get back with her ex lah
cause he doesn't sound good
I think my boyfriend would beat him up sia
then
how did the new guy react
mmhmm
okay
then tell her find new guys block both of these two
but I think right your friend loves all this drama and attention that's why she's doing nothing to stop it
if a lot of guys fight over you oh why like so flower like that
a'ah seh
a'ah seh
but then she not stress meh from all these drama
a'ah
yes we are like the one watching the drama not in the drama
I watch but halfway I stopped cause I waiting for the last episode
I waiting for the drama to complete then I watch everything one shot
a'ah
oh did you see the kiss scene
the kiss scene the one they finally kissed
a'ah
but very sad eh cause their rating only five percent leh in
mm oh this one is online one ah
oh

I think if netflix can show the ratings then confirm a lot sial
same my kim soo hyun I wish you win
what I want to say ah oh ya
a'ah the the height only ah the height only matrep version
I thinks he's lowkey a pedo eh
and like ugly like not ya ugly and just like I don't know lah cause

right oh I forget to tell you this same uncle apparently last time previously before me got another part timer named sarah lah she's chinese ah then um I don't know if she knows about this but he go around telling everyone that they're together behind her back
I mean it's like bitch no you're forty four that's so weird ee
delusional and psycho

ah
oh I saw your instagram post
oh
oh ya oh my god that one
uh huh

she live in condo
mm maybe she's those type that fake fake lah state rich but actually they are not rich maybe that's why she like cannot afford the kid lah then she kill but very heartless sial
mm ya that's true
do you think she feel guilty or not
do you think she feel guilty or not
the what
oh
okay means that one is definitely murder sia it's not accidental sial
bastard
straightaway will admit then confess then ya wow
this is why
ya that's why some people cannot be mums pity the kid
ya that's why
eh
ya
mm
siao bye bye sis see you in jail

over the line already ah
mm
bastard sia
imagine you are the father though ya that's why you didn't even get to meet for one time

a'ah
huh serious
oh
she's psycho
with that caption
a'ah sial
the lockdown eh cause you need to stay home more mah then the abuse at home all the case all rose that's what the reports say lah ya quite sad lah
eh that one next level sia wah I see them I angry sial that one
no I don't get it why they are not given death penalty why is it only twenty five years jail
ya that one is intentional already
ya that's why
some more the when the baby was hungry right so he go and steal the milk powder because obviously he want to eat what eat milk powder only then like that only they beat him up sial then throw the hot water at him what kind of parents are you sia until you do that this one not human already
oh my god
it's okay they can rot in prison also for twenty five years by the time they come out how they gonna find job also confirm nobody wants
yes
but I don't know lah how these people like don't how to say ah don't feel guilty at all lah meh it's just a kid sia
oh the
a'ah the evil step sister a'ah sial
oh wells
a'ah seh
a lot sia
ya
they honestly don't deserve someone like him lah if he's in singapore he confirm make it big already

is awake
weird lah sial
ya malaysia sis which other country will say this

now phase two I think
I think three hundred lah ya
no I think by next next two years
a'ah sial
ya that's why
five years
our
ya that's why
cause before COVID already got a lot of robbery case now confirm higher some more they see singaporean got money then snatch away your bag
huh really I thought that one malaysia I think need ah
I think they like don't care don't care like that ah
just like the donald trump say right um there can be no coronavirus cases if you don't get checked
same
same that's why I think he's just rich lah that's why cause he own a company what like he own the golf club also
ya he got the trump trump golf club or something oh and you know fun fact when he go visit other countries for like conference all this he will only go to his own golf club
so like so like he earn more lah you get it because when he go to his own that one then the his other like guests like this will also go with him what so more business for him lah in a sense
ya now the country is like whole ass movie sia like parody movie like that
huh that long meh I think two years ago what no meh
oh four years
ugh rabak
rabak sial
ya keep on every month also got new drama from him

K and K got that
you can put your earpiece back on
so anyway um how has your work been
oh oh okay okay okay
how long was it eh the practicum
huh so fast
mm
oh ya okay ya ya ya no no err what was I
suddenly
mm
oh
oh
oh no
oh
mm
mm
mm ya that that's why
ya
ya oh so
they offered you full time is it
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
that's good that's refreshing
mm
mm
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh ya ya ya ya ya that's mm awkward
mm
mm
go and at least resolve it internally
ya ya that's why
mm
wait that that that's a good thing kan or
mm
mm
ya
oh okay
or people with experience lah so they don't have to train so much
independent
mm
I see
ya
mm LOL
ya
ya that's true
oh that's a lot
that's why siao
mm
ya
I mean you mean in a single point at a single point in time you need to have like a hundred cases
like at at any point in time
oh so not like say this month I have ten next month I have another ten that's crazy hundred case how do you keep track
oh
ya
what I hear from a lot of my social worker friends
so you're not gonna take take up their
mm
mm
oh okay
ya
mm
ah okay okay
ah
I mean I got exam but I don't think that is comparable
am I am I talking too loud like do you do you feel like I'm talking very loud
no right
the phone the mic
ya see when I laugh it kind of
jumps up a bit so like oh no sorry whoever's transcribing I'm so sorry okay
that's where I'm at I mean that's not where I'm at I'm kind of past that but ya totally understand
ya
mm make sense ya make sense I mean you also still
mm
considering a different industry I mean at this point like my previous job was doing what I liked
but like it was
mm dream job kind of like like it had all the characteristics of what I wanted to do like child psychology in uh you know in a clinic setting in a clinical setting and everything and then I got to like
you know do creative things do research still and like do projects and stuff but at the end of the day like it was a horrible time
mm it's been good I am teaching
eventually when I'm no longer a trainee I will we will alternate like one will be lead one will be co-lead so the lead will be the one going through the activity and then after the activity is done
um switch lah so then the other the co-lead will be the lead so the co-lead basically what we do is we just look at everyone make sure nobody's like sleeping or like playing with the virtual background or like
there was a kid last week who kept pressing the clapping and the raise hand button and I was like oh my god
doing that thank you kind of thing and it doesn't come naturally to me lah cause I I I have a habit of being like can you can you um err I need I'll be like err oh sit down okay or like err
I need you to be quiet okay or like can you be can you be a little quiet actually I'm I'm like okay I can that one they they want me to like not say that okay be more firm because otherwise you know they are they are they are in the comfort of their own home so they feel like they can do whatever they want lah
ya and these are young kids like from kindergarten age to like primary school age so
ya it could be a little bit
practice
ya
mm be strict first
ya that actually makes sense that's what my mum said also
make sure they are muted got question unmute must mute chat disable then sometimes when you ask for answers for them to type the answer in
you know my period's coming
tau like I'm just tired not enough sleep so I just continued but then it continued to
I'm not coming and then turns out that nobody came uh okay lah like out of the six of us only like four people eh two people came ya so that were only like three people including the coach
mm
uh yes but in that case do you want to go with me I'm going on monday
I think like there's
there's
I'm hoping that aiya I can go
did she reply me nope not yet
with whatever hurts or what the issue is
mm
ah okay
oh
I see okay good that I
don't then
mm
oh then hers is how much
mm
mm
ya cause I was thinking if I went to see my sports doctor like the doctor that I was seeing when I was playing rugby kan
movement she she she's legit like the the one to go to but she's
ya just a lot
ya that's why I'm thinking
so doesn't really need like a doctor
you know I mean I can still move it's not like a herniated disc or anything like that
ya
ya so she also like told me to just
ten ten ten ten ten ten but twenty times
ya so it's like an endurance thing it lasted like forty five minutes it was horrible
mm
oh that is so
oh my god
I cannot imagine I cannot imagine and then like
you know
it's just like ugh gross
way lower than you thought
oh
mm and doesn't like fluctuate too much like like you won't go like super high mm
ya ya ya
ya
the first time I heard my voice as in I feel like I sound like a preadolescent boy I kind of feel like I sound like a boy when I listen to it by myself my god I sound like a ten year old boy or something uh
cringe
ya I feel like I sound like a kid I think inhan sounds not like older than me I feel
I don't know I feel like I sound like a kid I don't I don't sound like like a girl I don't sound like a like a lady or a woman I just sound like a like a like a boy
wider range of
that's true that's true imagine if we start singing you know right now you know
it is raining right now is any super heavily actually near my house
oh mine like stopped just now and now it's started again
ya how does my voice sound like to you like does it is it do you think it's low or high or medium or does does it sound like a boy
just sounds like me lah I mean like you heard you heard my okay okay
mm
yup yup
it's like from the we are like listening to our voice from the inside I feel I think something like that lah it's something like that so rather than but but
but but like say you you are listening to my voice as it passes through like
the air like not kan so it's a different ya so
I mean if maybe if we're on the moon we would sound different like so if we were on the moon and we
took off our our astronaut gear and we started talking we'll probably sound different ya but those few moments before we die if we have conversation we probably would sound completely different
no
chris evans oh chris evans I thought cause love love space or elon whatever his name is elon musk
err ya ya he wants to capitalise off another yet another thing
I wonder if we can talk about these politics I mean it's not all politics I mean it's not even politics it's just ugh celebrity
I guess
is it mm I had no idea I thought his late dad left him like buttloads of money
where shall we where shall we go on tuesday
which which interest you the most I feel like the train track ones is cute but then I'm just a bit scary looks a bit scary
mm
oh
mm ang mo kio park
so this one is easy cause it's just walking
mm ya and then there's
dairy farm nature park
and this one quite
oh eco green
like would it be very is it a park or is it like a a hiking trail like an actual hiking trail
I know afiqah afiqah you know she take some nice she goes to some areas you know
eh were you staying at our table
mm
she got married uh I if I'm not wrong she got married at quite um because like err
I guess circuit breaker kind of disrupted her plans a little bit and I don't think they wanted they want to shift the date too much so I think the period that she got married in right
um they only allow like ten people
mm and then she had to wear like a face shield but she bejeweled it lah like with her
like with her veil and stuff it was really cute
that she was she's always
talking about
mm I don't think so
oh is the is the one that her long term the one that always eh ya the one that's always been with her I've I think ya and he's really he's really nice really nice so I think
I was talking about someone else
I don't know but ya
mm
okay maybe I just don't remember but ya
mm
think he's just shy but he's very like supportive of her and everything I think that's really good
nope
think he's younger than her
ya
um
I'm not sure I think her place
I think because like when I see her her pictures and stuff she seems to be at home so I think
mm makes more sense
oh
I don't know like he goes out to work anyway so he's not
I mean unless they are both working ah then maybe
I don't know I don't know what I'm saying but ya
what would I know
mm
oh like the dad is more chill lah usually
and also like it's a culture thing also lah like oh you some mother-in-laws are not happy if you are working you know they'll expect you to be
ya especially in this day and age and in in living in singapore and stuff
mm
ya
ya ya
ya I ya
that's true also that's true
ya ya ya ya it's like a double it's like a you expect you say that and on the other hand ya
ya then when when he's at school or she's at school then it makes it you know slightly you have more time lah to like uh you know when when he's at school we're at work so your kid won't be like left alone and like someone has to take care of him or her
ya that's true

okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
oh was it with his girlfriend also
serious oh is it because of his surprise birthday party uh
so what have you decided
eh how do you get her number ah I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
wah your friend is so going to feel betrayed sia
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
so dah decide
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
orh
but you think he okay or not
serious ah
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza lah
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever lah
oh
okay
oh forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
oh that's good deal man
eh can you share the link with me
mm
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
alah
oh okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
oh and fly kite
oh
can you please buy a good kite
I don't know
oh but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter lah that had shade
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
what time you intend to go ah that's the point
mm
actually that day
mm
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know fuh
okay actually to me lah is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like Razi did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places ah then what happen ah
oh he will ah okay okay um because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
oh okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
gone
but ya that's very nice lah of the girlfriend
mm
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
Marina Bay uh Marina Marina Bay lah kan
Barrage if you got no car you go Sentosa
oh because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay lah
oh okay then Marina Barrage makes sense lah
yes yes yes
mm
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have meriahness if there is
I mean aiya for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
ya ya actually it's true lah I I mean no I personally don't like Sentosa
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for Sentosa
earlier lah
oh it's a weekend ah
ah
okay
oh ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
orh
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before lah in Singapore
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
ah okay
ah
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
the birthday boy is gonna be from
Tampines
not the other side of the Singapore right
ah
ah okay
wait where she stay again
near my house
ah near my friend's place okay okay okay
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
oh my god
anyway motor is convenient ah
but I think
oh really
so early ah it's indoor what
oh you mm okay lah I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay lah
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
uh I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow lah huh
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people lah so I always leave it to other people
oh ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like ah
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better ah
food
okay all growing boys
ya but to me mm okay lah for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet

you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason lah eh let's say
um
yes
ya you can't be bothered not like you're gonna eat much anyway
but
which you will probably be bringing because if you are after our lesson of going to Marina Barrage that day I

so that you can focus on your work ah
you don't have any other friends meh
you have right
yeah
oh you got further subset of your
mm
I know I know you know I know I know already lah
a'ah
but they don't
okay the subsets don't overlap ah
ya lah
orh
okay okay I know I know
and the same person I don't like too okay
wah I should make friends with this friend of yours lah
ah ya lah
no but I think he's like that because he sees what she do also lah
hypocrite he feels I think this is the long hair guy right that you don't like right ya ya ya
if I don't like you ah it will show on my face so you better don't see my face
yeah
it's okay lah no loss to him
yeah
yeah
so is no to him is no loss lah so that's why he's like that
do you do they know that you meet each other
oh they know ah so
ah okay
yeah and I know why you don't wanna go
yeah
oh confirm ah
it's confirmed
mm

okay lah
hmm hmm
I don't know I don't I don't miss in any way
ya I definitely won't be one of them
oh Marissa Shu you never go before ah
I think if you go with Shu also it'll be fun
you enjoy or you don't enjoy
oh
ya lah
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say ah
oh but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant lah but okay lah I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
mm
but they make you feel included lah
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that Shiqah Ad Razi group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean Aidil they all but I rarely get to meet him lah but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends sia oh and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
ah
but I think two person is much more better leh I feel lah
don't know lah I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
aiya but they going week weekend ah
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
I don't know how you can recognise such faces seh
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
ah no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary ah
try ah
cannot ah
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
I went there share I went with who ah I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
early part eh
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
oh crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay what
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared sia
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
yes
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
how
what
oh my god okay
oh
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
oh so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
opinion
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
because if he doesn't hide
ah he will say
a bit meh
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be Aidil lah up till now
actually actually is true eh
and then his mum will be left
aww
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
oh I don't tell her so that uh she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who ah
ah I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
path you wanna take ah I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
I remember
Kartini will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then ah whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already lah this one
then uh I remember lah the one in my secondary school is this
um very strict indian discipline guy you know
we were like
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
oh ya we we I tell you we are nerds what we can spend in library from nine eh nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
um was I like that for secondary school
I don't think so eh
no I'm busy for but I think on weekends when I have no
weekends when I have
yeah that's why nobody see me
yeah
no every week I study okay wait this the thing about me okay
people people try to what they call it ah
crash study crash
crash lah they try to crash everything into their mind after that ya that's I was thinking
yeah
uh so so for me I cannot so every week I actually have a revision for myself
we will go for lunch break
and then go back to library study
and then after that you take a tea break
at five O'clock tea break or dinner and then after that the best part is
yeah consistency cause I cannot take stress
I cannot take stress
when I found out that last minute I had test right in primary school did I tell you
I called her because they got surprise test
yeah
so it was during I can't remember which level ah in primary school and then the funny thing is
I found out that later on after the uh after our recess got test right then I call
my mum ask uh hello then I say
then I keep quiet then my mum hello
I didn't study that's the part I'm super stressed
I cannot take surprises
ya I cannot
I
oh
surprise
cannot lah sia I will be stressed
okay lah
that's
yeah I only learn that at my later part of my age ah
I realised I
eh don't tell this to Farid ah cause
he will laugh his pants off if he hears his mum is such a
yeah yeah yeah it must be like after after school days lah
after
if not he will use it against me
you know I don't like it when people use it against me
ya man I remember you normally
oh my god
A for commitment
but apparently it wasn't A for your final results
ya ya ya
if only they grade effort ah
drill
bit
ah ya
oh shit
are you serious
switch
hospital
ya that I know even though I didn't do O level I took O level I take I took sec two O okay
shaved plastic shave
yes
oh my gosh
this one laughed
oh ya actually it's true ah a drill is quite safe ah
you ask her it it kiap the thing right it's supposed to be
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya I know I know I know
I did my in sec two
I did something it was something I can bring back but of course I threw it away already I guess
wah that's a nice phone is that Ada's phone
no no I think it's Samsung
ya so I was a geek lah we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay uh
oh in the morning when you come then you ask each other eh
geography lah geography maths science okay
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater huh
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level ah
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
ah
ah because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
uh yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
oh sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
uh arts uh sports and
uh I don't know geek lah I would categorise uh debate as geek lah I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood lah it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek lah okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool lah debater oh I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why eh I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game um minefield
eh that one is I tell you ah
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject lah
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch oh
like how curious a a kid is oh why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the oh so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I oh the only reason why I went for that course was because ah ah ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
uh who err so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late uh we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up lah basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
ah
eh come on lah I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
he hor we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say eh you know ah
actually the head prefect saw my face already ah just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl ah
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class lah
eh so and so so and so saw my face already know wah if he see that I disappear already ah sure he will mark me one
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school lah sia
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
walao eh this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention lah
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually uh supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself lah
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no lah of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
oh
a'ah
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
oh my god
oh but the discipline master doesn't know you personally ah
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so pai kia ah
all cannot make it sia
ah
huh
eh actually primary school classes are the worst to manage ah
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths ah okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that one especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun lah they are innocent ah so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can ah if ya

alright
alright mahirah
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
beauty in everyone okay this is a
yes
okay
for me
for me okay aku
but but what can I say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble I think that is the overall beauty which
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
beauty in a long term woo
mmhmm
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so
mm
like okay because you are pretty I'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome I'm gonna go to no I rather I rather not
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
or jealousy no that it it is really a general relationship that's why I find that if you want to find friends in the future
mm
go towards the beauty or
oh damn
mm
mmhmm
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not I mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are um
which is um it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them lah
ya very subjective
mm
true true but overall selecting friends with with uh with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not uh it's not the right way to do lah I would say
so ya it's not
if there's if there's a competition you know what I mean
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
it's not it's unfair what because you should pick someone of uh of of talent of skills instead of beauty
mm
oh yes
pay plays an important role
mm
design
F&B
social service ya
true true
a a partner in life your uh
uh huh
that is true of course of course first ya you will see the appearance one or not
true true true true
me too me too
I think I think
for me for me right I I got a
okay I will share you later you you share first
mm
mm
mm
what's the point kan
uh I'm not I'm not gonna talk about myself err
things like that this little things that will build up um
stressful for some people
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what I mean but it's hard to get rid of it
handsome
ya
if uh can you make me uh beautiful because I don't think I'm very smart
I'm I'm okay this to me towards me I'm I'm scolding myself that means I'm trying to say that
oh that means when if I'm beauty
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
yes yes
yes
oh wow
girls or boys
again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
but
ya
really
practical
mm
you can say err comparing eh comparing
uh judgy but
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then uh uh most likely is the
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
this kind of thing is what
it's all lumrah manusia it's all uh human standards
which I think is
this one is is this this kind of thing lah that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what I mean
oh dear I think I heard a dysfunctional something eh
mm
mmhmm
functional eh
oh ya
ya competition err competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
there there will be a president there will be uh our manager there will be our the boss
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
usually it's it's gonna be the the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be uh
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
oh my god like
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
uh same like macam
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side err but the the the the negative side about
the look at the people will just support this uh this the group of
based on their
so that is the negative side lah about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way lah but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
mmhmm
true true
uh it's okay err but like eh like it's I'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what I mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example eh and then you call you wear uh
as time goes by
uh better and more uh
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay um
mm
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
wow okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what I mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it mm
true true
oh yes
but you are not a hipster you know what I mean um ya ya ya
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
I think saturated
I would say today this
uh of uh twenty twenty of the twenty first century
it's not um it's because uh as technology evolves we evolve
uh facebook twitter youtube
why I mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a uh company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
uh stage you know what I mean
uh
have the same people that will hold you back
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
fashion wise uh people are now using uh fewer are following the more of the K pop
go jer
mmhmm
value is it popular popularity mm
mmhmm
self love
okay for me
as long as you know
where
but I mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that uh circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find uh someone that really is genuine in your friendship
to be in that position then maybe I'll have I'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and I will be very depressed full or whatever right
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
so go ahead like um move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
yes I I still remember our first our first
so and
sec um
not at for us err we don't we don't we don't go to that direction
so that's a good thing
I I see the like our
no point also lah judging like move on lah move on
our circle of friends ya friendship
yes yes yes correct
yes there is
wah you you got you got the face man
ya you got the face you got the physic
okay mira filzah is the uh actress in malaysia
full package full package
that's a good recipe
you know what I mean
mm
mmhmm
okay role model to me
in my family I I'll have to say my mum lah
my mum is someone that
if some if some if someone that
although that she's tired but she still
ya so role model
neelofa neelofa
like real be and and she's very muslimah also so I thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
ya I take that as a as a
wallah
ya
okay ya it's subjective it's subjective
mm mm
mmhmm
those who have that
um like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same lah just human being
ya
whatever you have would be taken away you know what I mean
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself lah
mm
yes ten years down the road what what you want to say to yourself okay okay no no no uh okay how about before that we say
err the one thing we regret
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure sure
wow that is deep that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
I tend to look down on myself
very low
like I should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
uh the respect that you you're given by society that is more
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or
oh message to oh okay okay
oh okay that's good that's good
mm
true
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued lah in this world into serious eh for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
and I have experience of of job interviews of people of a higher standard
have my own uh business or I I'm uh I'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever lah bigger title whatever
I mean you shouldn't judge
bad which I don't want that to happen and
that's a wrap
we shall end this okay mahirah see you in the next one
one two three

don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
um I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand ah most
fully because it was in a tour
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
there are shared memories together ah
oh berry van eh
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
and ya lah so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then lah my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya um and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
ah despite my aunts' protestations
and ya lah so he jump ah he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply lah kan you got there
and once you are done ya lah I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
ya
actually for new zealand um
the year that I went
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match ah so
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
err
eh did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
ah was that the first time I felt snow
err
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun lah
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine eh
ya
K lah how chocolate is the best lah
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
ah apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
woo shiok ah
wilsons promontory
dapat
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food ah kan
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
err
ya
um you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
um you can even decide on the spot that hey I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I just gonna shoot straight for
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
wanna drive all the way um
what they do is they drive
to penang
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border oh you see
so to me
then the other alternative is fly to
krabi or fly to phuket
ya
ya
true but then I felt that okay lah I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience lah of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship lah kan
cabin cabin
ya
it wasn't that bad
no lah I guess when it got
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm lah
ah
oh ya
ya I think supermarkets overseas ah
um there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
because they are the producers ah that's why
ah meat so fresh
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
true
even the ice cream is different
okay
because you have a variety to choose from ah
much more predictable in that sense
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
quite common
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
mm ya
and the best donuts in the world
eh do you notice
it could be ya
we ordered the the bombolinis lah the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
um
and
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique um overflowing
so they were oozing out and okay lah I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world lah
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya oh and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
plantains eh
did they grill that one grill kan
I think it was grilled and then they put um brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that ah
ya that one
eh there was something that I thought about um oh oh oh oh oh oh um london um
the devil brownies ah
ya that was a random find ah no we went to that
that weekend market
um I wouldn't say it's a random find lah because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
ah correct
where aspiring business owners visit this there err these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons ah so these dragons are
um so ya she pitch her brownies to them ah
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
err she used that as part of her advertisement lah
ah but I really good are really really good
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
ah noodle oodle um that's just
soup ah
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
K imagine nandos ah so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
ah the price the price is way cheaper than nandos ah
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab ah
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
ah yes
eh the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name ah a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice ah
ya what else ah
what else was nice that we have
oh buffet that that buffet was power
eh that was a nice chance upon ah
that was not in our initial plan lah because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
um ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay lah it's a saving grace lah
it's a saving grace because I think
um those ya that jacket potato was nice
ya it was milkshake and skittles ah
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian lah at least oh that was some nice jacket potato
ya
that's true
kan
ya cheaper lah ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands err on prada
understand ah it's still thousands eh
B I C E S T E R bicester
yes
somewhere near the south
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
okay lah
so far none so far the three of our major trips
we have there are this this three major lah the and the two australia
ah
oh
err
slide down the slope ya
best ah
fifty
mm
oh
ya
the beaches err jog my memory again where did we go
oh sydney ya bondi
I think we did
portsmouth
ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay lah I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
um
oh oh ya ya ya
ah
but it's hot ah
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have err
two thousand let me recall ah when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
um we went to travel around the areas lah so we went to spain um
specifically we went to madrid lah
so err I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
mm ya
um I think you really have to plan
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
so I remember there was one um
so when we reach belgium
um we thought that the bus station uh at that belgium to the airport was quite near lah
only for us to realise that actually
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely ah
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
um
ya
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour lah but sixty kilometres away ya kan so it's still quite a distance
forty five minutes to get there ah
this was the start lah almost the start I think ya
so we negotiated lah we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind ah he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind err I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros lah basically
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation kan
and then by the time we reach there he
uh maybe three quarters ah
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got lah and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed lah maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey ah
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight lah but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
ya and uh I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you lah
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid lah ah but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
err I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think ah
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
ah so dah happy happy
ya that was that was an
ya
oh I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
no
ya
so
no
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each ah
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it ah
ya
power ah
ya that's why
ya
ya
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ah like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
ya
ah yup
true
who came up to us
say assamualaikum and started to err to talk to us in malay
so we talk to him when quite further in he said oh actually yes he's bangladeshi
for
working ah so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then um you know went back went to spain to work lah
ya working overseas is something
okay lah not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months ah of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close ah but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome ah to the point that I felt that hey
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both ah
okay so um when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
um the or the muslim students association they were quite
um vibrant and there are very active lah
so um I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them lah
because when I were went there also um
it coincided with the fasting month
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short ah

mm
orh
oh Jetstar
okay
orh
ah
okay okay
and then we've also been to perth
three times already in
the whole of
last year and I think probably
mm
mm
mm
mm okay so because kan you are the type of
mm
mm
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook lah so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things lah so I felt like
I didn't know what fish I was supposed to cook with
so I just bought salmon lah then I wanted to cook salmon curry but then
uh
so it was a bit weird lah ya
I know right oh my gosh ya
enjoying my sleep lah
then after that leh
the car outside kan
the but then I try to look out the window lah I wanted to kaypoh lor
and uh
ah so ya like that lor
so that's what happened
then after that
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
okay
oh
oh my god
eh that's so bad leh
mm
oh
so that's where I get my news also lah TikTok and Instagram
ya
the presidential debate
ya so
I understand
so ya so then kan
ah you know actually this year
save money so that I can like buy a house here
ah okay
oh
oh
oh oh that's very good
okay
ya
so then it's like
it's like if you have in the reports kan it's already been stated that if you have any underlying conditions
you know or uh
and actually touch all these
ah
ah
and looking forward to phase three lah
okay
ya
oh
mm
okay
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
ya
ya lor that's true
if let's say you were the prime minister
okay
of the highest number of COVID cases
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
okay
oh that's not good
mm
ya
ya
as if lah it's so easy kan
mmhmm mm mm
it
so
so ya
so then
so today
so then oh uh so that's why this morning
I'm
so the breakfast wrap was only four dollars sixty five cents
but
uh it's one for one so end up the thing became only two dollars lah
so ya
ha and some more my pillow covers are all white
so it's like the thing turned red lah because
it will stain or if I wear anything white it will stain
ya but whose hair will be after you dye
exactly
ya but then but when it's wet it will stain my towel lah
mm
so ya lor like that lor
and then
eh
wow and I didn't
um this is for you and I was like oh
okay actually I didn't order this uh
uh ordered it oh okay
it's a local delivery
ya lah
sometimes my mum is okay lah
then
mm oh
the
mini golf kan
Holey Moley
norza
a'ah I went with her
orh
wah that's very good
okay but it's not too late for me to start
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
ha
huh
okay
for lah oh okay
ah
mm
mm
oh okay okay
okay
mm
unless we have this type of project lah
ya you know a little bit of extra do no harm lah kan
mm
so
mm
not right not right now only that I want to take my time and then we see what happens lah
mm
ya
so and and then actually
mm just
you know
have a career change
mm
mm
ya and then we ya so
and then so that's why it's a bit like
so ya
mm
like singapore living cost is a bit high
save a little bit more to make sure that you know that your parents are well taken care of lah so
step by step I guess one day at a time
mm
mm
mm
um
hong kong paris dubai
mm
kan
ya
eh
the furthest he will go is changi
the furthest he will go is changi
he won't go anymore where further than that
mm
mm
ya
that travel agencies will bring her to all these weird places kan
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
oh my gosh
right
ya
orh
only when I'm at home
mm
ya that's true
so then that what is the point of taking the leave you see
on leave
then I also take the leave
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm okay okay I see I see
mm I see
ya
so ya so you know I wrote an email to my management err my housing management because like
um
ya
to um
you know make sure that the the rubbish is thrown properly and responsibly lah ya
you mean I stand outside the rubbish chute and wait for the person to not throw the rubbish
no lor on the floor every floor or itself don't have the lor only got is in lobby
mm
um
oh okay
korean drama K drama is like
not really my thing lor but then I can try lah see how lah
a'ah
mmhmm
ya exactly
is that the word you were looking for
ya
not so well because I'm not used to it
more of like english songs lah
then
after that
um
ya
so then I was like a bit like
um I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have err to go uh with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
weirded out
um
so my birthday dinner is coming up
only you and me
um
mm disrespectful because it's like
like
you know um single so of course it's okay with you
it's nice of you to do that
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
ah
tuesday wednesday thursday I'm free
like asking me to pick the day of
where he is free
but not when I am free
okay
then I said oh weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
time and and happy birthday in advance
um
oh uh don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free
but I thought before this you said it will be with your group of friends
and then now you are asking me
I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me
a'ah
okay
so ya
disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see but
mm
ya
huh
the cases it reemerged again
and now they are all back in lockdown
mm
so they are all back in lockdown
mm
mm I think so
mm
and the infection is is more um
the the virus is more infectious
mm
mm
uh
job offers
mm
mm
ya
you
become prolonged because
err
could not handle this COVID situation properly so that's why
ended up the entire
uh nationwide
everybody in the world
did not manage to contain the virus because the two largest countries which is the and
china
were not good at managing it
ya
if it happened in a much smaller country or a much smaller nation it would have been easier to contain
mm
mm
ya
exactly
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
you when you compare to
and it's very diverse that's why people like it here
and
ya
yes lor
hmm so ya
uh and then it's right in the middle of botanical gardens
mm

like keeping the world safe one day at a time
mmhmm
mm
oh if by next week it's not
open yet that means it's closed forever so I checked monday first thing in the morning I checked it's closed so
aduh
I don't know what to do eh mala and me are like
halal
halal
okay then what was stopping you thought
a'ah
and she was eating mala so
and she's quite one of those like religious kind of girl so it should be like halal kan
I don't know I was thinking of texting rusydi like
to either dabao or like see if she can like register us in that time we said I'm willing
to go the extra mile
to be registered in but ya
I did I didn't and I was like everyday I eat mala I was like
you took it for granted ah that's why it's gone now it's your fault it's literally your fault
ah
you usually eat the chinese sausage it's
it is
oh ya ya I did take that
we got the like the duck
ya it like flavours the whole dish
ya
ya
Ichikokudo ramen a'ah
as a family you mean like family dinner ah
ya so I think to me ramen is not my
oh you like you like yours ah
no I didn't
uh garlic ramen I felt like
the richness of the flavor tau
I didn't like want it to be spicy
ya
ya
I bought Samyang light
ya
ya
uh
it's lesser
it's
ya you can barely taste it
do you do you get where I'm like coming from
the ya the the the gravy
but this one the calories is lesser so I feel like I'm
it's literally about three hundred seventy calories
and the but the noodles are slightly thinner but it's the same texture the sauce is like less spicy
no but it doesn't affect much ah to me
but the taste to me the sweetness is a bit a bit stronger
oh uh
your ability to taste is there but it's still very spicy to me I was literally still dying
ya
Samyang
ah
the packet one not the cup
oh okay
serious
ah
ya
um
mm bachelor of
to be honest ya to be honest
err
okay so then I would I can get ten thousand off a year ya so it'll be twenty eight thousand and I'll only be there for two years so it's about fifty six thousand
no like I I called the overseas education it's like a
they liaise with the university for us
ya I called ya
kan ya ya ya
that's why I was just thinking then she said accommodation about uh eighteen thousand to twenty thousand a year
ninety plus already besides cost of school
ya like for real ya
right
ya
oo period
period
bro
ya attachment issues
elisa
a'ah
mmhmm
okay
super smart okay
how her is like almost like it is like three point eight kinda vibes
no but if she has a four point O it will be known tau because usually that is like honour roll
people get four point O in their courses usually like
like is broadcasted to the whole cohort
like during the process do people like the does the teacher like favour her
oh
daphne also four point O
what
oh ya ya of course lah
vibe
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
make enemies with a snap of a finger
oh
oh
down to the T I guess
ya
mm
oh
a'ah yes
ya
okay okay okay I mean everyone has that like dream that they want to go overseas right
like why would they want to come back because their university degree cert is mostly applicable there what
ya
loan right is a very risky
I don't I don't think singaporean I think it was from china I I can't remember ah I honestly can't remember
ya so within like five year he can pay it off
oh ya they have minimum wage ya that's right that's right
singapore like university degrees I think like three thousand like I find that quite like
low ah to be honest
which one
that's all ah he can pay it off in five years it's like a it's like a return on investment kind of vibe ah
but ya
but it's still a bit risky ah like what if I can't find a job
kan
ya but I mean I'm just putting it out there into the universe about the overseas thing
cause I'll obviously try my best to go into a local lah
like no matter what
it's quite scary ah to be honest
go overseas and everything
ya
um
like my class is number two like there's five classes so O one O two O three O four
ya
but I would not choose a class
kan what course right
ya because you did you know that I have a passion for planes right

oh ya
the TikTokers in general
do you notice how
as a person
super
no she is
she is like serious she has like millions
I know avani is not as famous as the rest
even james I feel like james couldn't even like hold conversations with her
like as a person she doesn't have that personality that
is linked to a influencer
ya she's just like any other introvert
who just got this fame and then she doesn't know how to talk like at least with all these you should learn how to talk right
but you don't
she's a good dancer but does she deserve hundred million do you agree
ya because it it literally convert
okay
to be on a record like none of the TikTokers because it literally it's just fifteen second videos
it's just fifteen second videos I think
ya but if you have this fame you should at least learn lah to
ya
ya
ya period bro nothing on them
ya
ya
do you think she's interesting
no when when we talk about influencers we don't talk about talking to them do you think they have a lot of personality because that's like the
a main selling point like james charles he's so interesting
no he has an it factor
that's what I'm trying to say
ya
he's
mmhmm
um talented
like legit it's legit just uh
period
going out and drinking coffee

it's the white coffee tau you know it's like basically caffeine like zero per cent eh zero point one per cent that kind of vibe
ya
and knowing that I have like
caffeine like resistance and like all these like bad stuff
anxiety a bit

final theory is more to me final theory is harder than

like like I can't can't do I can't do it I can't do the virtual thingy I really I really don't find it like um
productive at all for me throughout the whole semester
what about you what about you
mmhmm
mm
ah
mm it's
still not the same right
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
eh but serious ah forty eight hours
oh my god
uh uh uh
mm mm
mmhmm wow
mm okay I see I see eh uh but forty eight hours forty eight hours is really long eh
uh
oh okay
mm mm mm mmhmm
wow five sections
mm mm mm
mm not really ya it's it's not clear ya it's not clear at all
ya
ya is it what you using
mm
mm that's why
okay never mind
can lah but it's just like it's very hard for me to like
like there's like a bit like
anyway right um
like she gave like eleven questions eleven questions
like there was like minimum of words words in a minimum and then um ah she also specified lah like um the uh
it's quite a lot actually ya I mean if it's like maybe if it's five marks then okay which like I would say it's like worth the marks to write so much but it's like really just two to three marks but like ya so it was like very
very hard ah I I don't know it's like um it's the questions were not hard it's just that I find that um
ya
eleven essays
cause like
cause
ya ya I did I finish way way ahead of um the the the the submission period
lah cause I cause I honestly feel that um the longer the paper right the more you will drag the more you will procrastinate
you what I mean ya
you you
the questions were okay like just now I say kan it was just like okay the it just takes a lot of time and then like having to sit in front of a laptop for like long hours is like uh my back was like crying for help
ya from from I think like from having like online lectures to like online exams it's just
it's just the whole the whole thing is not like helpful at all like the whole in like for like studying something right it's like not conducive at all I I feel like being at home
studying at home like like managing like things alone no managing like having like classes at home it's very it's not conducive at all
ya cause like you have like family members around and then people are doing different things in the background and then you can't really focused and then it's like affecting your um attention and then you get distracted and then you will like get up every now and then to go to the kitchen and then get something you know
it's not like err I don't know I just feel like it's not conducive at all to be at home and having like lectures or exams is the worst
it's the worse eh and then like um like like like uh
my results ya it was it was it was it was surprisingly okay I like I like same as you ah I expected like worse cause I feel like um some of the modules they were like quite uh heavy
they quite heavy and then like the the workload was also very heavy so like
it took a lot of like my time and energy like completing most of the coursework so it's like I I I've I was like very very um drained throughout the whole semester like mentally drained physically drained so it's like mm like I was quite satisfied with um my results lah cause
I think the I think the lecturers are being uh quite lenient lah
ya ya
ya
uh huh
mmhmm
uh huh
eh you know what was funny I I've been in the same situation
the attendance was like not compulsory but lecturers still took note of who attended class right
cannot ah
so I'm like virtually I'm there but I'm really not physically I'm just somewhere else
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
oh
ya
ah ah ah
uh huh uh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mmhmm
mmhmm
ah cause
for me like ah for me right um
I don't know why she wanted things to she wanted to make things more difficult for us you know like
she was like as like for like every week
like three three or four slides she would go through so like the slides was like was like nine nine to ten minutes and that's it so it's like she only goes through like first not even like first part it's like very small part of the whole chapter so had to be we had to really go every go through everything on ourselves
cause like you know it's it's heavy it's it's it's also a very heavy um course so it's like I I feel like it wasn't helpful at all and then she was always like she's very high expectations on her students ah I I honestly feel that way I mean
ah in the situation we're in right now is like not really helpful lah
so it was like more pressure on like whoever is participating in a group work
we just like you know it's supposed to be a group assignment and then like like out of like six people like only three
so I was like ah it was very frustrating cause like for me I don't really like to confront like
members who don't really do their work
especially when like
um like group members don't reply to your texts and they just like they only leave you on read everytime frustrating kan
ya exactly ya ya exactly
and then
ya ya ya
ya ya ya I mean
oh okay that's early I mean
we just finished exams right
mmhmm
uh huh ah oh same same
same I'm taking malay also ya
ya but level two cause I took the level one already
mmhmm
ah
okay
mm mm
oh
ya ya ya ah so it's not so draining right cause one
so I just got in so maybe like my classes will start tomorrow I think
ya so ya
but then right how's for you ah
ya
ya
ha ha ha
uh huh uh
mm
sorry what good place
uh huh

this year
mmhmm
me
uh I would usually I don't know I do I do I don't really keep track of what I do I would just I don't really keep track of what I do but like if I were to remember correctly like on like a normal days
ya
ya
like really anything I will just like switch up to like a lot of a lot of things
now cause I really I don't know uh then this my daily ah most of the time I think I think I spend all my time watching random videos
if not I spend my time on social media I spend a lot of my time on social media
uh
I
social media oh
I don't know is it
ya ya ya ya ya ya
like it
sometimes people like express their opinions like openly kan
kan
ya
they will just
ya ya ya exactly exactly
kan kan kan kan
ya
ya ya ya
ah
uh huh uh huh ya ya ya ya
mm
mmhmm mmhmm ya ya ya
cause like
it's like ya I mean I know what to say
okay what
mm mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya cause for me right um I I I sometimes that I really I know what to say I know what to say it's just that I don't know if I will be able to word it in a way that people understand where I'm coming from you know
mm I really can't I really can't I don't know how but I really can't cause
I really I really
respect those people who really have that confidence to really to really you know just just say whatever and they don't even care if like I mean especially when people like um people reply and they have like err like there was there's like a clash of opinions and things right then they will have like a they will somehow have like a certain discussion
like between like another user and then it's like oh no I would I will never do that I mean even though like
kan
ya exactly exactly
ya ya exactly oh really I mean then
mmhmm
uh huh
a'ah
ah ah yes yes yes
ya ya I mean
mm mm mm mm
um sometimes sometimes
mm cause you feel that sometimes as much as you enjoy reading like people's opinions right you feel that sometimes people are just like the the opinions that you read or whatever tweets that people tweet right it's sometimes if you feel like they screaming at you I don't know sometimes I feel like everyone is being too expressive about everything
sometimes for me ya like it's like ah sometimes I feel like ah I get I get tired sometimes I get tired so like you know sometimes you just have to like uh just take a break from it but like it's still like you know a few days and then like oh okay can can already ah then you know activate back and then like okay already
ya cause I feel that sometimes like as much as there are a lot of like healthy discussions online there's still like those people who like to force the opinions on other people which is of course not healthy like you know and these are people like you find like
uh
it's like uh like I mean
ya I mean like sometimes you like I mean I get what you want to say but then sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that people won't like have that same opinion as you you know
you know

mmhmm
why ask
well this is my question to you but like okay I'll answer
um
that's the real life like this
that's what that's what happening outside and
you know we tend to forget that
we're not we're not the only one we're not
and we're not just the earth doesn't just come by of singapore you know there's other places but we're not sure of how they living the life
and how this these things gonna actually happening in other countries we don't see it in singapore
you know probably like
um serial killers there are some in singapore but it we never know how gore can it be how how how other people could like you know be be that crazy to do something like beyond humanity
mmhmm
um I wouldn't say I remember
but like what gets me is it was black magic kind
you know
black magic usually like from malaysia
like they will kill each other for it or or maybe like family
they kill each other
the daughter kill the mother
or the daughter kill the parents just cause power ya
or drugs
you know how like could be and it turned everything upside down
you know
mmhmm
right
oh ya
it's not there
mmhmm
anything
speaking of existence
um
how do you think human will become extinct
how how
how
yes we've seen a lot of um what do they call it
apocalypse
how human get become extinct
you know how how um how
food or you know mostly movies is like
they eat something wrong and they become zombies
and then they kill and then the whole country becomes
like
like non-productive anymore not not working anymore you know they just become zombieland
what do you think
mmhmm

hong-kong
or taiwan taiwan
mmhmm
right
right
softly
is that a song
mmhmm
a cure
ya
a vaccine
right
right
right
but I feel you know what I feel
I feel like you know how scientists are coming up with
there are animals coming from the ocean and the biggest like animals that you've never seen
right right right exactly it's deep down in the ocean still more living under there
and and the fact that whatever they found out now
is already scary and it's already big enough to actually conquer like to scare humans
you know and how humans now are brave enough to actually go
above beyond the ocean that they they can you know they like diving deeper and deep just to find out cause of their curiosity and then I think
at the same time with the virus like you said
you never know what's the next virus
like five years ago or like two years ago we never imagine we have to go out with a mask
SARS
what time is that yes
but you don't have to wear like a mask like a it's not mandatory ya
it wasn't it wasn't
mmhmm
true we're not taking care of our own earth
mmhmm
true
right the icebergs are melting the world are rising
right
so like let's say you know that the world is not doing well
okay what do you think in your power or your might your energy
what would you have done what would you do what would you be doing for that
for the country even though like you don't have much we're just normal people
we don't have much either but what would you do to actually you know
at least just humanity in whatever is happening
what would you do
right
like
influential that's that's it
mmhmm
ya
mm
as long as it doesn't affect our daily food
what we have to care about it
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay speaking of which if you have
um
one meal
or one dish they would eat for the rest of your life
you know let's say the world is not doing good anymore and all like okay we have enough for everybody first one could be but we only supplying this amount of food this type of food for you
for the rest of your life
ya for the rest of your life
I cannot
either meat or spaghetti
ya like
steak
ya steak
you know
we can cook like
we can fry it we can like
boil it
ya
can boil it
make it into a soup or something
you know it could be bland but it still feels like at least I'm eating something you know
you know
kan
that's a sad meal
that's what we have to eat for the rest of our lives
okay
okay now speaking of food right speaking of food
let's say I bring you over to a restaurant
named karma
a restaurant named karma
so by restaurant named karma right
karma is retribution is it retribution
you get what you do
comes around
so if if if I were to bring you to that restaurant
and what do you think you'll be served there's no food just to tell you karma you'll be served on what you have done so what do you think you'll be served
mmhmm
ya
but why
I was rushing for for work
you know like for example that's
you know it could be something like that could be something petty like that but at the same time we could be like
um
mmhmm
ya
ya
what if people judge me
I'm always thinking like that
mmhmm
when you had the time
ya ya
right
I think
I think for me
myself would be um maybe um answering back to my parents
you know
cause I was at the I'm a very stubborn person if I think
I need to answer back like no matter who I would answer back you know and then if um I think there was a time where things wasn't going so well
so there was a time where I feel like I need to answer you back
cause you're not getting you're understanding me ya
so I think
the the dish that will be served for me would be um
ya it would be maybe like a mouth or something a tongue
probably cause I wasn't understanding of their situation either you know I wasn't trying to be
the kid who try to understand I was trying to be like you got to understand me cause I'm growing up
you're adult you know what I mean
ya so it it could be like if related to entering that probably a tongue or a mouth lip
you know
probably I mean
it's gonna be served to you
it's gonna be served to you so I don't know
it's a good one ya
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I hope so even with my son I feel like if I were to go to this this this restaurant
probably my son I mean like the days where I purposely sleep in cause I don't want to cook you know I'm just like
ya
okay okay
okay I have a question
okay this is a question for you where I think everybody thinks about it everybody um ponder about it it's a dilemma
the question sounds like
would you prefer good looks or a fit body
when we look down uh
we don't want a show off our fats we're only wearing black all the time
you know but it could be you're fit you know you you you be wearing good clothes good body shape just nice you know
um perfect
you could be walking here and there the whole day and you're like okay it's not so tired but you'll be like having acne all over the place
you know you probably have scars
fit body or good looks
ya fit bodies ya
I mean you are with good looks good looks mean you have like a
mmhmm
mmhmm
why would you this is a
mmhmm
ya
ya me too I mean
right
mmhmm
right
anyway I have a child right so
it's like
if I have good looks and I'm unfit
you know I can't be I have to be on par with his energy or I have to be more cause
yet I have to stay from morning before he wakes up and up to the time he's asleep
you know I have to stay throughout the day I can't be like I'm tired and he's not well taken care of
you mean
ya people would be like oh my god pretty mum you know
ya but
but that's it you know what if you're not there for your child's carnival or like you can't run errands
yup
very true very matured
speaking of which since you choose fit right
ya what is it
okay
no
no it's like since you choose fit body so what do you do to keep what what you do to keep your body fit ya
ya
who cares
ya
ya
right
keep the body busy
but I know
I know you you have a high metabolism
right so I don't think I don't know whether it's true for you to actually like lose weight you won't really gain a lot of weight
no
mm
are you blaming on me
ya
right but you should be happy when you are losing your weight
was it was there actually uh a way for you to distress is that the way for you to actually
mmhmm
is it you were doing sports was that why your criteria you had to
like on a certain weight
eating certain things
true
I felt that too
mmhmm
it's bad
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
right
but I think as long as whatever weight you are I mean now
on a healthy weight even though let's say you're sixty or seventy but you're healthy you know you are you are not falling sick all the time you're not visiting the doctor all the time
you're not always like
um eating panadols to to to keep yourself alive I think that's fine
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
just health ya mm ya true cause
partner

orh it's this happens a lot you know politics in the company and
I mean there are no
chances that
the moment you change companies I mean change jobs
it's gonna be perfect you still gonna face this kind of
issues you know work life issues and
I don't know lah this life that's
that sucks but
it's important nowadays that
company
you know take into account
I mean that's why
um
exist
ya so and anything complain jer
ya with no power to change
nothing no control over
you know this kind of things
you know
I am a student care teacher
err basically I just supervise the kids lah
um you know
make sure ensure
their safety is well taken care of hygiene
and you know we're
make sure they stick to their routine
and then mark their assessment books
but the funny thing is
my boss said that
um
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
a moment later you're there changing the
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
homework
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
torturing so
a lot of people
a lot
that's the thing
ya and I can't even laugh with them
I can't even
talk to them
like
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
I mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you I mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do I do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay lah I mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
I wanna know
it's okay just tell me
oh ya I did oh my god I miss her so much um
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and ah I met man the house so so empty
and
and ya lah
and all that ya
but
I don't know I'm happy for her
ya that's like
I mean like
nowadays um
you know when you find a soulmate you know you just
you just
it's important to go with the flow you know
like
not forced upon it
not
find it you know once you stop finding for it then things
come
ya that kind of thing
but I heard you and your
your boyfriend has been together for
for years right
how long eh how long eh
oh my
god
oh my god that's really sweet
oh that's true
no
I don't
eh
every once a week
oh my god that's sweet
ah
but then my ex
err previously
he don't even remember
ya
so
I think he's called ex for a reason
mm
is it but are you the clingy type of person or like
I see
okay okay but like
I mean
mashallah I mean like
you know last long you know till
till married so wait okay
K
now I need to ask you important question
when
where is
when can I be a godma
okay lah I mean like we are still young and he is also still young he is in right so you get your freedom now
I mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay lah take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
oh I love that
I need to write that's
a perfect quote
um me and my family okay
I don't know eh I mean like I'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have eh have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
I I think I have to be the bigger person right now but I'm still coping cause I don't know how
I don't know I'm really I'm lost
but
okay lah slowly slowly maybe I get to learn stuff
but I'm still at a stage whereby
I focus on myself a lot
and I'm scared that
you know I might
I might
lose
the responsibility
I mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
oh man
I saw this post and they said that um
the first child
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
um ya pass off so
but at the same time you you are nurtured
um
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third lah
so that's why like I'm lost right now but then you are the eldest we're like okay okay I get this right I get that right
so ya lah are the pros and cons
but
I I hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because I look up to you also
cringe
mm
that's true
that's true
and no wonder I'm friends with you
um okay talking about sweet right
I scared leh I scared of diabetes
um
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
diabetic
his deserts you
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
oh my
I'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high lah
but
okay the thing I am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then I I went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower so that you
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
mm
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
I mean I don't mind eating salad
but
the options
I mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
you save so much
one to two days
wah this is
is quite hard
ya that's true
I mean I've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know like
like why can't you just love is free yes
okay love is free
I think like we're at that age
where everything is just hard
is it a twenty two
no no no
twenty two curse
her
grandfather
and then drove back home
and left him there
malaysia lah
singapore
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then um they receive a phone call from the dad um the dad call another lah his son lah another son
then went there
and he said the father said okay me home lah then then they say like oh it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay I can live in your store room also
the father pass away
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
you know
that's true that's true
I mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why I'm scared I really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good leh
because
of um
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so ah
how old is she now
but the around
oo
I think more the the the the over sixty five lah
definition of
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe I I mean like if I'm her also I will
no fresh air I'll be like
lonely at least we go out where you'll get to people watch you know
just watch people walk
and
I I enjoy people watching honestly so I can relate to your grandma
oo that I like the question mm
um I
think kan I would
probably would love
love
to
just
um
around
okay ah
paris area
london because
is it so rushing
I have heard a lot of people saying that
the rest of them are chilling as well
I want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know um
ya lah but that's my goal lah
just
ya you how about you
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax I don't know
I feel like singapore just need to chill a bit lah
it's just too fast pace but
but
ya lah
and like
people like us
so I feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control kan
I mean it's not weird I mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me I wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
god but like
I don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
five times five
if I have a high paying job I don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle I can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
mm
we're like that okay
but
I feel like ya I mean like if you have
something to work towards to
I mean you get motivated what
in certain way
but
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future I mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
I mean that's good lah
planning is
everything
honestly I mean like
you don't just
like
eh okay
but like
ya lah
I mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
oh I took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation I took a one year gap
ya we did we both did I remember
it's like
think about what you want
actually that's true I mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so um and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
meant to be
that's why I believe lah so that
I mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
oh man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know I took a one year
gap come on
no I
after I graduated
I work okay
then I
kept up
do they work part time also
I didn't know that
I didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing I know you were good at savings I know you had like
wah a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
oh my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason I mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
I feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know I mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
I mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and I heard that is a good school
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so I feel like you have higher chances of
getting
intake
but inshallah
I mean like you can I can lah I have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
I mean uni hard is going to be hard I mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya lah you can manage your time well
so
I feel like you can lah
and is good because you are taking full time right
answer me
what what what which course are you planning to get
I mean you just mainly just look at your major what minor you can choose later cause major okay what marketing is it what
what which part
ya
I think minor minor in business or what
minor is just
literally the word minor is minor
the major one is a major
you get what I mean
ya so
but marketing is
on demand nowadays
right
and
healthcare also
I mean like you can market
but under healthcare what
why not
oh ya I forgot
doctor times
okay
ya but I have heard about it
eh I'm but I'm planning to
I'm planning to
going under healthcare also
like under social work
now after this feel cause I'm tired of teaching
just tired of
watching kids suffering
so maybe I will get back to it later
you know you know I'll just explore and
this is the thing I heard you know I don't like when people generalise
us
as job hoppers
ya I mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
I'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
but
okay lah I mean there are so many expectations of us
I'm not
try to
I mean there is
people our age
but
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
I mean don't
borderline you know that kind of thing
so I really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about lah
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
in singapore
because all those movies are
always based on other other countries you know
I don't know like
okay like
overseas you know working overseas will we be success more successful like oh
you know as compared to in singapore
you get what I mean
ah okay okay this now is a fun topic okay I don't know where but I like ah rom com
you know romantic comedy
those kind and I like thrills also thrills movies
ya so anything that keeps my adrenaline you know rush because I'm an adrenaline junkie
how are you
so what type like
like usually you Netflix
wow
wow I barely have time for that
do you watch modern family
oh my god you should watch you should watch it's funny
oh is it good
it's funny
it's it's cute
okay okay
is it okay I didn't know that I mean like I always
oh I mean I I've seen
everyone like posting about stranger things
but like okay lah I I might watch it one day but you should watch modern family
it's hilarious
hilarious
okay but if you watch modern family with someone
it's funnier
then watching alone probably like uh
okay lah funny but eh quite boring
not boring
but like it's
nicer with someone
exactly and I'm single as hell
oh that's so sweet
I mean I wanna watch but I don't wanna get stuck
on on it you know
like people play like among us
but like I don't
I really want to try but I don't want to get stuck on it
is it a hype or is it just for a while
I see okay
that make sense
but I can see you is the type of person who can control you know you have
quite
I can't like I don't have self control
know things that
you know are healthy
and
ya I don't mind spending
over
time on it
alright oh my god it sounds like a plan
okay
it's been long since I start playing you know
games
and ya lah I mean like
we are twenty two what do you
expect
we rarely oh my god did you overcook
it's because it's so hard
is it okay which one the the older one or
eh the younger one
eh wait wait wait wait
the
the youngest
oh are you serious
you don't play with the second one
I see boring
but
ya lah I
I mean I love four
but overcook is fun
that's true that's true
I mean but
ya lah I mean
I'm trying my best to not spend
not spend on stuff that are unnecessary I mean like
there's a lot of things I wanna do I wanna shop you know I wanna shop for facial stuff makeup
because
I feel like overspending I won't be able to save
in the future
do you invest in anything
on so every month
I see but how much does he save per month
you will get
more
than what you save
hundred K
I mean it's quite
reassuring lah to know that
ya so I feel like you should you should invest on
I mean I can I can like brief you through it lah
like
all these investment and all that kind of stuff
it's really productive okay
we should

what do you think of young marriages or arranged marriages
hit me
uh okay let's say ha
okay err as young as eighteen
child before marriage so you are saying eighteen years old is like a child still a child
oh
ah bad image like that ah
mm
mm
true true
okay then err let's see if err they are they are married already then after that um they they are not stable
both of them after O-levels maybe they don't want to work anymore I mean they don't want to school anymore so they took part time job then they feel like oo got so so much opportunity in this part time jobs so they want to grow from those part time jobs
ah but they're not stable yet ah like they still ya like don't have any plans yet for the future but they know they want to get married
like papers in papers like at eighteen I want to get married now
what are your thoughts
oof
okay
okay focus on marriage first ah would you allow your children to do that
mm okay
true okay
in singapore
oh okay
like agree
ah ah
mm
mm
mm
ya he's the one that kind of thing ah
ya ya ya ya
true ya
ya
and you're already married anyway kan
ah
true
okay then it brings me to the next question
uh if let's say like err you you get into a relationship already ah then the guy is like I want to take it to the next level but you you're in a fresh relationship you know
what okay so
the the major question is like how long do you think is a good time until you should move on to the next step in life
ya time
ah
okay okay
mm
okay
play around you
mm
huh
they call it off for eight years' oh
eight years oh my the fact that you actually drop so easily ah the eight years
ah
ah
interesting ya
aiya
ease sia
ah I like I want to to settle down tie a knot you know start the family planning you know like
start my future lah you know
yes sia
oo wah
mm
true true okay ah
okay we are
next year is our third year ah
mm
true true
that's basic adult things ah adult marriage things you know ya like oh we have to save money to buy house you know that kind of thing
so I think that's what both our parents are looking at ah
but ya lah like what you say ah it can be on papers you know so that is not a sin for us to be together
mm
mm
true
I to me I ya I see it from that point of you ah to me ah because honestly being this old
but it's just that like you know older generation thinking I guess I don't know
but ya what do you think
true
ya sia actually true and it's workaholics
I mean people different err different mindset lah ah
mm
it's true oh my god that one that one is a major issue in singapore sia like money is such
money just plays a big part eh in singapore
okay lah I mean
okay ang moh err
mmhmm
mm
true ya ya ya okay lah it is
actually err okay when I was in kan everything there was so slow
like I have to get in if not cannot sia late for err late for work you know that kind of thing
ah
ah
a lot of people coming in ah and I I feel like it's not stopping you see true I think a lot of people ya
ya dead rich but the point is like
err very late very like um she said that
singapore's err healthcare is the best
because singapore puts there are healthcare like one of the priorities of the country so I feel like err singapore is number one lah for healthcare
ya like a lot of people come to singapore like I saw a lot of people okay there's this ah
web for err what's that called
they come to singapore to get treatments ya so like err this one is cancer so they quickly come to singapore to get a treatment for cancer this one got tumour so you come to singapore do all this
and then another one is ya no lah I mean it's not that they do it but a lot people want to come to singapore to get that treatments because it's reliable
then um I don't know lah a lot of people just come to singapore just for healthcare
ya
no oh my god you know healthcare is so bad lah
is so bad
ah ah ah
I okay come on lah singapore is
err accessible okay like
got clinic here hospital is nearby in every err town area and then that kind of thing ah correct but in if you live in the suburbs it's so hard to get to the hospital it's probably like one hour drive away
twenty minutes away thirty minute away that kind of thing
suburbs
who have a lot of land then they do like farming you know that kind of thing ya so it's those like with big plotted lands lah it's not necessarily like they are not rich
but it's just that they have a lot of land and they want to do a lot of things like farming you know that all that kind of thing that we cannot do in singapore lah basically
so ya there are okay lah as
they do have the land that's all that is the good thing about they have land to do a lot of things but then sometimes they don't take
ya they don't take advantage of what they've been given lah
so
oof
ya hor
I believe singapore because like singapore I usually like if any land any
bedok jetty changi you know ya
so I guess this I understand lah why the government is building all this
ah we are we are not an enemy to anybody
to me it was like
true ya
that's true that's right
ah that one that movie
ah and ya and ya ya lau pa sat
oh is it it's true ah
oh I didn't know leh
oh
oh uh huh

this month lah ya ya ya this month I remember it was earlier this month sorry lah
we visit should have
ya but I I saw like
they have very little stuff like um maybe like three at the counter they okay actually they have a lot of staff tau
and then they needed like people who do food food and drinks
so I saw like
then oh got wider go beyond they got to ah so err twenty then
a'ah
ah
so they have more people lah actually but it's just that it's very little like uh one each
but it's extra work
you know it's extra work
but I always go when there's the double deal the we buy fifty get hundred dollars
that hundred dollars that you know when the ya I'm always up to date okay I
ya I'm always up to date okay I love Timezone and I got so many points
ya
but then
ya speaking of that
did you see the one of the ministers suggests that singaporeans like they if they want they they can take second jobs seh
aiyo is not the east coast lah laila ah
mm
mm
ya
true
ah ya
ish woo woo woo chill
ya sia
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
but if okay lah let's say if err
even if we were to take this second job right how to okay for example we take you as an example no we take you as an example okay you work six days a week you know
where can you find time to slot in the second jobs sia
oof
Grab money come out more money come out what

oo right now ah right now okay lah like money lah money
being twenty three I have no time already eh okay I think if I'm twenty three and single I still have time ah

so pure is not in terms of virginity
oh
oh
woo interesting ya
I want to watch ah okay ah not bad
ah yes I know
I know the second one also
ah yes glass
but interesting ah
especially for singaporeans who are like they're not exposed to these kind of things much it's not rare what to see all these people

mm
mm because
and having a lot of money
or like when I want to buy something that I like
then the second one I think I want my own transport
oh best part is
but I since I already
the travel you know
ya then the third one
I want to have like
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
so what about you
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
talking about family gathering
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
so
I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
mm
mm
mm
ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait lah for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
then
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like
no lah we put that aside first then we
chalet
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food lah
forever food and our transportation
like
share among us
book out already kan so okay lah
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
kan celebration also need more money
decoration need money also
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
party together like that
um you know that a
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ah
mm
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
ya lah marina is nice lah
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one uh one place where I know
outdoor pe
cause that time when I went uh to marina
uh I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there ah
so
we
parasol whatever lah
ah splash lah
like
but still like nice because
I think I think our cousin have I think ah I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still uh that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
oh
ya ya this one ah
mm nice we can go this kind
mm
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
they let us
mm
I not sure later after this we can google ah whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
mm
mm
mm
we confirm know we won't sleep what
oh nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle lah
mm
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate eh
no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad ah
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade lah no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
whoa okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before ah but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
mm
what about glove
for rental lah
mm
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want ah
what if people really got like
pee on it or what eww but ya still ee okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
you want to play with the animal
ya I don't know what what I mean okay maybe our interest like so different like
like
what's more that that you can do over there
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that
but I think they got to bring their children right
mm
that's why I say but okay ah okay ah it's a nice idea
then we can go for like normal outing also you know I feel like we should just
go out like normally
time to spend together you got like
you working they working
mm mm mm
nice ya but
then the rock climbing indoor
ah zip line I I I don't think so hello inside the mall have zip line
when I was interning at kallang
but I feel shy
ya ya you need to pay I mean like obvious lah you need to pay but it's like
munch munch on snack or what
mm
ah ya lah can but
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
ah ya lah since we already book right we don't need to personally book in with our own body pe
no lah I mean we can just say what sorry excuse me this is my place I already booked this place uh then you can just ask them to go out lah
mm
so ya
but I'm gonna stay at the side
can what
but it's nice what it's like when you at the seaside
nice what it's such a good
uh memories
serious lah then after that
you
ya
you cook one I cook one
okay lah whatever lah nice whatever lah okay
and then we ask then
while waiting they
ask them to buy or whatever buy all the stuff all that
ya
mm
so that
oh I I don't think so ya
I mean it's gonna be only the two of us
mmhmm
ah so that's what you meant
no lah we just put at the same place lah
like I mean like the same kind
so
mm all the same so that
ya
ah ya ya ya nice what like that we can just throw after that
mm
mmhmm
eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
mm

because
but if not whatever
mushroom
mm mmhmm
since okay so what I'm planning to do is
we
we from this side from west side we bring food
they from east side bring all the drinks and chips
so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
then we need one mineral water confirm
mm ah ya lah obvious
a'ah
mmhmm
ah ya lah
uh them to
as long as everyone can eat

mm
okay ah
ya okay lah not bad can
mmhmm

okay maybe for us ya but maybe not for them lah
mm
mm mmhmm
take out everything
open all the cans put inside one bowl
ya
so then after that
if we buy the one with the crust then we ask them to cut the crust

mm
we going glamping yay
ya
ya like the normal picnic right ya
ya
mmhmm
but we tell them already what from from like
and before that we also need to talk about and about the gift right
so
uh if you want talk about the gift then I think everyone need to fork out about ten to twenty dollars
I don't know I don't know if it's better for us to fork out ten to twenty dollar each
for both of them or it's better to just buy whatever
we're gonna spend a lot of money there
mm
mm okay ah nice

mmhmm

oh
oh
wah
this is so interesting
you got like a a just mini celebrity of sorts with a niche following
ah
oh my god
oh my god ah
mm
corprate
ah
okay all right all right
ah ya
in some ways tiktok is like the wild wild west
ya
okay
uh huh
oh
do you so he knows of your existence now
oh but like it makes you feel happy right
all right oppa noticed me senpai noticed me grab get out
ya ours
ah
mm
wah wah oh not bad
um you know sometimes you get knowledge um from the unlikeliest of places
ya
yes yes
thank you
sexual health
there's like sexual health plastic surgery you know personal finance take stock is a treasure trove if you know how to use it well
okay so the you know the um with a song that I showed you just now is it's it's basically um it's a K pop song by shinee
um ya so um so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny uh K pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
it's I never heard I never heard
oh okay okay uh maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
I recently learn this term it's called um um
kissing my teeth but if you've seen it on twitter stands for kissing my teeth
so like for example uh
what what's the oh ya ya ya ya I know it's so true oh my god
eh nasha
ah I mean like that number ah the number the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so um like on on on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's that's the tea
I got into
um because I saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily uh loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main um
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like err an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on uh any
uh any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
ah tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your page cause it's well curated oh I see it is on your page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize eh you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once uh once it realizes that eh this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin to see you
oh wow
oh oh wow amazing wow
grab ge</mandarin knows you but you don't know his name
okay okay okay
wait so when you say that you gave him coins like how does it work cause I'm not familiar with the contract

mm
you want to try it out
then how do the other students like do they catch up or are they behind
like the first thing cause I would maybe I was to focus on like myself but I didn't notice the second it was fine because I was surrounded by jokers
oh right right right
something ya
just breathe what's the studio called by
oh right so I'd just
ah beat factory
how many phones do you have
oh my god this one
is it for your games
so the new phone is on for your games
wow

oh oh my god
there's a post to his live now
all these ge</mandarin watching on a saturday night
ah
mmhmm
aww
do both right right right
so like one phone is like watching his live and the other phone is like your maples lah
hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that I did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where I don't like I thought that you know you should you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
what's your exact the plot twist that I didn't quite expect you know watching anime
ya I've I really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya I'm so ashamed for like you know you know anyways but I'm I'm watching I don't know if you know this show it's got saiki
the disastrous life of saiki
oh that's good
but it's very very promising and I might start on it
okay okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like um slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called saiki um
like exploded
strength ah yes yes yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also uh teleport um
he he can he has pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole anime
ya it's just him
the whole anime revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep uh people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole anime he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
um you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
um I don't know it's about twenty three plus
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like wow
right right I should have finished like one season
ya ya
oh ya ya ya ya
I'm starting there
ya you really have to get into it
oh
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a gundam series on kids central
oh
ya
mm mm
yes yes
yes
mmhmm
ya
okay okay
mm
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact gundam I all I all I remember is I I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
mmhmm
oh okay okay
hmm
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into gundam and you're like no
gundam
ah it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now um
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet lah correct
um so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
ah no I think it's still with aisyah okay nevermind that's fine
ya so um
I I told her like eh sorry ah I really cannot bring you because sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would um
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch um
but some countries
she knows but some countries its thirteen I saw ah I saw on reddit she's on fucking reddit
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya um it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze um there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends lah or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is err five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really um topics that you don't understand like uh explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because um
I like to read like I like tea you know to um
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their um comments is always oh this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad lah I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
oh ya so back to ah so um so I asked her like uh can you give like uh
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere lah and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
izz can easily catch up eh
ah okay lah not bad lah
oh yes
not bad
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
mm
ah
ya ya ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
oh okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
oh my god okay okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
um this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with sha it was after A levels
um I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about uh this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
um came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian um
okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this um spies
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
wow really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was um a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and uh so he was videotaped right and then the spies executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like oh I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you um
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
uh huh like nudity or sexual references uh ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending oh it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
mm
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like oh okay wow
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it oh my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
ya alah
ah right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like I mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
um this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya wey or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with haikyu she was really into haikyu her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that um but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance uh series
when I was younger lah when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
a'ah
it really impacted the way um I saw how relationships or is
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no no no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
ya
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a a celebrity preacher
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so uh so he's a very popular
preacher on on and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like uh thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out um it was from this girl
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial um like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like respectful the person like
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like oh my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have uh this kind of like
uh ya ya ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
uh fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like um
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
yes it is idiot
so okay so tup tup they ended up getting married
yes
I know I know done with the question about everything so uh he was looking for her
a'ah
ya ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like um like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like oh my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay lah when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything um
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
ha it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean um the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
with uh starting mira filzah and if you know adi putra
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first mira filzah was twenty four seven
ya
and I'm like you know we can do without these scenes if it's
so difficult lah logically
yes yes
ya that's why like
it's it's so weird
correct you know the first
like her head ah ah
the instant ha instant I'm like okay I get it
realistically this does not make sense
ya that's why
which also brings me to that stupid um commercial shampoo commercial

mmhmm
okay I can recommend you
dinner
ya then
but ya
hmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
orh okay mm
tomorrow
you have to orh so for for them to make the final changes ah okay

wait
aiyo
among us among us
ya you said like that it's among us
I don't know eh I feel like this type of thing ya obviously
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya he's he's a very soft guy
which is good but sometimes not good because
ya exactly
then I feel like it's pointless lah honestly I mean I don't mind giving him advices so that he will be aware of like whatever that is gonna happen that he have never experience before but at the same time if
a bit tiring lah can say
cause I know that he will still love me even I look ugly or what
dress up a lot and I wear makeup a lot then
think four
four fifty
about there lah
ya
I feel like that's why ah
and like I don't know why I don't see the point of
oh like that okay lah
mm mm oh oh
a'ah
okay okay
oh ya
light light festival ya
scare khine
I don't know and I was quite shock that she actually told me eh oh really ah oh ya ya that one I told you right that was quite good eh good acting girl
oh my gosh damn I miss being in the same class as you sia stupid
I cannot be friend I cannot like someone when that someone is my friend
ya
but I really like our friendship sia it's really quite unexpected sia honestly
honestly I didn't really want to make friends so with anybody because every semester I have to change class do you think it will work

okay
ya okay okay got it
yup
but it's also the whole heavy thing lah once again to have to drag in her luggage or or I don't know couldn't tweet
hmm send it to her
you name it lah they will print it on something and it's digital printing which means you don't need a like must order minimum hundred or what can even give her of our faces to wear on which day today I feel like a sham day
today ya ya correct correct
ya ya ya ya ya and when she lonely she can talk to the picture
ah guys I need some advice
ya ya okay
so ya I think I think vista print all this website got ah and I think this that would be the same website that also makes a photo book
you know what I do after awhile I throw it out I don't like clutter
eh I've had to throw all sorts of things in my life in order to like fit it into this house and also when I went overseas to work
much I don't have pictures of people from secondary school all bird fly high hard to catch friends like you hard to forget I don't I I never bothered to keep those things I feel like um if you want me you know where to find me ah then we can hang out
ah I don't I don't know ya so anyway photo book wasn't the best thing lah but I thought some pictures or or the other thing is we give her a bunch of pictures that are nicely printed and then we order the thing online say buy from amazon but it to be delivered to where she is ah
ah
like super glam shit and then we like then can pin the poster have like cool headline or what then write some funny copyrighting for venue and
date you know that kind of thing like date that when
ya ya I know I know I know ya ya ya ya ya and I think actually that's what she prefers too but I suspect when she she said that time that cause she wasn't even sure whether this is happening like whether they're gonna be able to secure the mortgage get the place there and be able to you know actually move lah
but then I suspect once it's confirmed there got iskandar is settled there is a flight date ticket
confirm she want to meet everybody and his brother so I suspect there will be a bigger thing
I don't know how big is big err when where how we're going to do it in groups of five as per the government guidelines
but
but for us I think I don't know is it just come over here and do our usual or is it want to have like a a lovely dinner outside somewhere
okay ya I'd like that
fuck so all these by the end of the month okay
ya I'm ya ya ya and she has this fear of
to do with the two of them yes yes
what are people thinking of me
yes she has
ya ya she's definitely discovered
they flocked to her ah all the little malay girls on the floor the little mod girls
they love her
ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
ah ah ah
cause that was the day that you found out I see okay got it
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya ya
fuck lah she's such an integral part of the group I'm gonna miss her like hell man
I've had it with you all yup ya ya ya ya ya ya
ah my understanding is that the the guy was playing the both of them and then sarah beef
with you was that you were talking about it to both sides
okay
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya ya
so all this was happening like at the same time while he's flirting with sarah he also like cuddling up with tini what the hell man
ya ya ya ya ya
yup
alamak
uh huh
wait this was the day we went to eat pizza
fish I didn't know the pizza had such undertones so when you brought up pizza thing I thought you had something to do with she coming but not feeling like eating but then is it she no need to contribute to the bill you know I thought it was that sort of like bill and who pays what drama fuck okay okay okay
yes
yup
yup
ya
so did sarah know that jas was doing this with tini
she didn't know either okay got it
ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya
so what was tini first reaction then when you said she went bitch mode
okay
ah
ya ya ya ya ya okay
then she come down for what
ah ah ah ah
right
ah ah ah
okay
that's right
ya okay got it
yup
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya yup
that is not nice explain
like a party girl no
yup
ya that's the you cannot correct correct you can't mould other people's perceptions lah ya ya ya
ah that jas is playing that jas correct correct cause tini was like totally completely oblivious to it right she didn't know ya she didn't know sarah didn't know as well but tini felt like the person who was
losing her heart over him ah it sounds like it like like tini really was quite set on it being rather serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya so it's a it's a big deal for and she must have been really hurt
mm
when there are friendly things you don't reciprocate ya
mm
ya ya ya ya I remember that
ya
okay
just even indulge in gossip you get what I mean ya ya I know you don't do that either
okay
ya ya ya ya ya
ya
okay
yes
ya ya ya ya you you have no control over this lah ya
yup
so probably just a bit more careful lah when how she speaks lah
yup yup yup yup yup yup
I mean one wishes it never happen in the first place but friendships will go up and down lah it's like that lah sometimes there are just little areas you don't go to finish ya ya I think it's it's it
it's the sort of thing that you think about when you are thinking about how valuable is this person to me what sort of a friend it is it's not just the happy moments that you will think about but it's also about the bad moments that you guys were able to patch up together and that I think really adds to the value of the friendship you know the amount of work you put into it
ya
yup
correct obviously there's a lot of censorship going on yes ya
friction
yup
yup
yup yup yup yup it's how you then deal with it together that matters
ya
ya ya ya
yes nisa likes to set boundaries you know I like I like I've learnt a lot about setting boundaries from how nisa does it I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with this so I'm not going to do it ya and and it's
it it comes as a surprise to people that I use it on I don't know if it's cause maybe when I say it I don't see it as nicely or sweetly as nisa but I've noticed a lot of people like eyebrows raised when I draw this kind of boundaries
I I really think that's missing ah in schools ah how to politely draw line you know
ah ah correct and it can be done very politely no one's trying to hurt your feelings here you know
ah ah ah ah
there was definitely silence after I said that like it hung in the room for awhile
three seconds then err then continue lah but I was
truly unapologetic cause it was too late at night and my brain was just ya not having it like I don't even have the capacity to have it even if I wanted to you know I don't have the capacity sorry it's too late
err
oh okay okay okay
oh okay so there is a possibility he might come is it oh okay cool
ah eh I can't talk now I'm sorry I'm doing the recording ah
oh oh ya dude we were just talking about you
or maybe he has left okay
okay so I don't know do you want like tackle the questions that we had okay we are halfway through so it's not too bad um but ya
it's taking a bit longer than expected cause I think it's cause the antibiotics are making my mouth like damn dry so next time I do this sia I need water need what what
god I hate this medication so much
huh natural things
no cause it's it it's means it put in effort if somebody just walks up to me and give it to me now I will gladly drink it I will so gladly drink it I just can't be asked even get up go to the toilet cause it hurts so I'm not gonna go and no I don't think so
I don't think so
did not reply to message until next day five o'clock like hello ya hi no not today I'm not coming today I got I got migraine
huh I don't know why the soldiers didn't cook in the tank sia
like steamboat ah oh inside the tank got aircon
singapore
as long as I got my aircon
okay ya so I saw all that but then I think later on in the day I saw one facebook video of like tank it was quite surreal the tank go past but the the guy whose job it is to kill people with this tank is just waving very happily I'm like wow this isn't what I'm paying my soldiers for you know who ask you to wave
ah okay but can't see it ah
ya ya ya ya ya
oh that's cool
I was working that night mm mm
err
ya I don't know why cause ya it was interesting it was just so uneventful
err if you could
oh god I completely forgot all the questions I don't know what they want
memorable meal
you know I can't even think of one
okay maybe got one where my boss brings us to this like restaurant in bali it's called mosaic and it was super fucking posh and not just that but it was it took indonesian
and then wove it all into a menu that was that told a story ah from start to end and then at each point for each dish
that's such a great way to make it like another dimension you know to add on that's cool
off the top of your head
okay
oh
ah
ah ah ah oh my god then you just take the whole thing ah ah ah
ah
don't break don't break
yup
and wah
yes it's the moments ah saffron ah saffron
ah ah ah
ya ya ya
I can imagine
I have a direct bus to tampines here not even at the interchange you know
one two seven
could be yup
ya ya ya
tampines ya got
so that's the end station in mind
ya zoo is ang mo kio lah ya ya ya
ya that used to be my commute wah and another way that I used to commute was how ah oh no this one is when I go home time I take from the zoo but then I stop somewhere along thomson road upper thomson there then I take a bus down I walk there I come down to braddell braddell view then I walk home ah
it was a nice walk home
today is
to get a response so I guess it hasn't been three weeks but I'm also a bit sad
accordingly lah cause I will be putting in a lot more work um then the other concern is also when I went online when I tried to look for like you know services like this kan
I want to lie in bed and watch
so I guess not having it is something we've been saying recently ah not having it
I I haven't heard it you started using it
not having it
no mood ah
then it doesn't help that my stupid boils keep happening
and I'm so incapacitated
okay so that was memorable meal
that took awhile
okay cool
ya also I provided an update about my current job hunt tight situation
oh um
I I don't remember one
oh if people didn't have to work what would they do right
okay so this is
ah actually it is I like this things
like I I if I really had money right then I didn't have to worry about food then I would I don't know then maybe I might be asked to cook cause I know I can buy whatever ingredient I want for example you know
an issue ya
ah ah ah ah ah
correct correct correct exactly
ya correct the info is all there and we know it it's
correct
correct correct
ah ah ah ah ah
ya
yup yup yup yup
doing this sort of things
ah correct correct maybe finally have a ant farm
don't know leh I mean if if I feel like maybe not sure or what I got questions then maybe I can call ryan
hi ryan ya his name is ryan so beautiful
I could see all the other mums over there were all like hyperventilating man
coach her ah
his name is ryan and he works at the ant museum at katong for little while he was the favourite of all the mothers
mm mm
so confidently
ya he had a very good err speaking persona unlike unlike his other there's one other colleague girl I think was quite good
but there was know there was one guy that I was like like making serious enquiries lah about how much actually is it gonna cost me to come up with my own anterrium and all these and he was
a bit like don't really answer the question and will roam the point a bit before getting into it be like oh okay
of course
but of course
you think he knows
okay
ya I think it's no more it was extended for awhile but I'm very sure COVID would have closed it lah it's too small and too um
ah ah ah ah
oh okay okay okay then get into it like damn obsessively and do terrariums that are like artistic
I think those books ruin a lot of young women you know
I don't know they were fun haiya I definitely went through a period of them I even use to shoplift them these romance novels ya man but then you know what I do or not will take out and then put the ones I took the last time
I don't know why I went through a phase in secondary school ah it's a bit punk I supposed property is theft um
yup
party eh
got sex one ah
oh specifically ya okay okay okay
okay okay okay
okay okay okay ya I've heard it I've heard it for sure I just wasn't completely sure
code words ah ah ah ah this is like codeswitching within codeswitching
matrep ah ah
ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah
right
ah ah ah ah
yup yup
oh
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
oh
oh
ah
ah
ah
oh camouflage ah
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya yup yup
to make it more obvious right
right
yup
right
I never knew marsiling was okay okay okay
oh
ya ya ya
right okay okay
there's a lot of looking ah
ah
ah
oh my goodness what an experience for them
yup
yup that's very nice
true true true true
correct correct
correct they grow up in a very different world ya
yup I think they are more open to new things they don't have prejudgements as much as us ya ya
that's so cute ah ah ah
ya
right okay
yup
yup
yup
these kids ah
ya how beautiful what a gorgeous story
ya ya ya ya
so a lot of brown people step forward lah as supposed to chinese people little things like that you know
and it didn't occur to me even that I had that I didn't have this privileges
that wasn't my point my point was one guy towards the back of the room who obviously grow up with a lot of privileges crying ah sobbing like a baby cause that exercise got to him to the point where he just felt like
had it right but no lah the the it's just the way he cried it it really reminded me of what you were saying about the younger people in who see the world a bit differently but then they don't understand why everything cannot be equal you know whereas for us
so then maybe that was a shock to our system compared to them who was already born with a world where you cannot expect anything will happen at any time ya maybe for them it's a different way of looking at things I don't know
sundilah
ah
that was really weird and and tone deaf I thought this this election got a lot of things that were tone deaf ah from the side
firm that may not have I don't know many people that are representatives I don't know man
people's voice kan
ah ah
I see I see I see
ya ya ya ya
your vote now
ya I don't think it matters
for singapore supporting the government cause of covered walkways
sundilah it's one hour
okay then one two three

I'm planning to lik
two lah because the um the flat will only be ready in middle twenty not really middle lah early twenty twenty three so logically is the year before lah ah
err so like I mean if I were to move as in just yesterday we were discussing lik
err
so it doesn't make sense lah to travel from the west to the east the east to the west then after tha
ah the one definite lah
so that one will take time definitely don't know how long it take lah bu
definitely will have to stay at one place first lah it's either my side or his side lah
so that's why the the the budget is a concern lah
um
oh it's not like one whole thin
but but then if you do everything at once right it's save time righ
for the location if let's say you want to do for bridal then do photography videograph
chey
err they have catering they have decoration with including the err plumbing also and then err they include the door gift
and then err tables and chairs all set up all the basic everything is there except that the only thing that top up that one is just and
such old school you have to follow according to what happened last time so we must have everything must have a big wedding so my concern is that if I cannot afford I mean not he cannot afford lah if I cannot commit to tha
another fact is that I'm the first one I'm the first child so obviously as a father want to show off mah so like err very proud you know finally you know somebody err my my child is getting married or whatever but the
alah they don't know the the cost to get tha
err there's no need for any vehicle lah I mean there's only just need one way lah just to do the whatever photo shoot after the weddin
ah that's why at least everything will be there so for example if let's say you do at orchard at that hote
at least you know the night before stay one night after that ah want to get ready just go dow
burning hair to think of i
I suggested to my mum lah like come lah to meet me and give me advice lah
I don't know like nowadays people like I mean due to this pandemic kan
so people are starting to to get married now because due to limited in capacity kan because my own friend also she's getting married on end of the yea
but then because is they have to top up more s
uh manage to find at this particular location somewhere in the west lah so uh it's not a location that is suitable for wedding lah it's more to like education wis
ah so err they had to actually emerged certain rooms to become one big roo
something like you know those typical conference room meeting room right so um no not they had to make this type of compromise but at least its it does not affect in a way that they have to top up mor
they are is still within their budget but their problem is right because now you cannot have buffet you have to give bento bo
the balance of the money that supposed to be deposited for the wedding right she actually used to take out one more photographe
ah so at least you know you don't have to be stuck with just one so you just two so after that uh
became because of that also one good thing lah I mean not about travel so she splurge out her so called honeymoon in singapore err
ya lah the week after the wedding lah she will do that means like I think mayb
within december lah she'll she'll do honeymoo
it'll take about like a yea
so the next one will be second time already which has a lower chance of ballo
alternativ
ya that was the initial plan but you know lah as usual pay me but then
the groom side is giving a gift lah to the bride side is i
is it err oh
ya but some people still want to display the notes righ
ya ya true dare to it y
err so is there a magazine is through Facebook lah so this lady was cheated and um you know I jus
why you go and marry the guy if you know that you're not ready for it if you're not financially already s
that's the thing lah and when it comes to this thing as in wedding and marriage it all comes down back to mone
if you they will the basically right their terms like if you have more guests is cheaper so to avoid tha
as in basically kan you need to have okay ah for example like that that that particular location at orchard err it's for one thousand person is about twenty plus plus per perso
then another company is offering that oh if let's say you wanted maybe about five hundred people lah ya for both side that means two fifty each right then it'll cost about the same pric
or maybe slightly more but of course lah about thirty dollar plus plus and then leh I compared those tw
they only offering two then drinks also is like oh asia's err hot tea coffee and then like one cold drin
this this one is the one that another company lah not the one at orchard is another company so to me is that ya your food is nice your decoration is very nice we went to th
showcase and is all very nice very tempting and they even offered multiple locations but you offer your location but then you
package is so not good it's difficult you know and then uh there was one time err the package includes brida
you compared the price of each eh to a brida
stay we will just stay until until the end even until the end also nobody else will just stay right maybe about ten minutes or s
um we will only book one event for one da

so far I think they're okay just that the girl is going to primary one now

I'm actually looking for a tuition teacher now for her do you think I'm crazy
ya but singapore is so competitive I'm just worried about her
hais

a tuition teacher because my husband feel feel that we should start young eh you got any tuition friend or not
tuition teacher

maybe about forty to fifty
I want them to come to my house lah I don't want to travel out already very tiring you know
good good thank you thank you

just on their phone ah then never never even like take care of the kids some of them just allow the kids to run haiya crazy ah I don't know why this
these err their bosses ah never check on them

orh you see lah I stay home so long ah never even read news hais I think I must start reading news to keep up myself
ya eh now COVID then how they want to engage maid
can or not ah
I think I rather stay home
keep my home clean
mm
mm
five days
so
oh
wah
hmm
mm
mm
uh huh
oh mm
stress at work
mm
ah
eh mm now got what exhibition over there
wow mm
but
mm
mm
mm
so a lot of people uh take leave
eh you redeem already
hmm
managed to book a few
attraction
so I don't know how it works
orh
mm
ya that's true
go johor
and then I can buy all my baking stuff
ya
but now COVID I don't have you know we we can't travel out and then everything over here is so expensive
so at least when I I get to go johor at least I make a bit more profit
mm
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya that's true lah eh you know about talking about government ah they give the free mask new one I haven't collect yet and then the the best thing is they have the
the mask for kids so just have to measure
how big is your face if I'm not wrong
ah then my friend tried it then
well
know
ya
mm
mm
mm
kan the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
mm
mm
mm
mm but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country lah but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go um
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
mm
ya that's true
mm
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have um
enough people it's about
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless lah
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
daily ah mm
mm
mm
wah eh you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
mm mm
okay
mm
ah
mm
hmm
oh
fifteen dollars per hour
mmhmm
hmm
expose lah
oh
mm
precautionary order at mm
housewife just like me
mm
mmhmm
they know better lah
mm
mm
mm
that's true
eh ah I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
mmhmm
huh
is
we'll see
uh huh
a few cartons
mm
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
hmm
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
can lah if not you can just order in
mm
ya that's true
mm but it's quite expensive lah but
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
eh
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
mm
mm
hmm ya
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle lah but lucky he is not using because he's uh on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
mm
ya that's true
hmm
ya that's true
mm
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched lah I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
hmm
some of them even went to uh try
wah it's really you have to work extra hard for this uh
mmhmm
mm
oh
oh
mm
that's long
mm maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying uh well
mm
oh
mmhmm
mm
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then um my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of um what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive lah on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
um having that symptom of COVID nineteen
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary kan
mmhmm
ya
mm prata
ya ya ya that is my favourite too should we go there
mm
ah okay eh that's the shop so come let's take a seat now
okay so I want
um
two prata

mm
orh
oh
maybe I want one
teh peng
no teh with milk and ice
why but it's so hot now I need cold drink to make me feel fresher
ah
okay lah then I take one mineral water

eh they have this food app that you can order online maybe you can order and then we just sit down and then they will send us the food
have you tried this
mm
okay so you ordering or I order

mm mm
hmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ah

so mm
mmhmm
oh so how did you get to know about this like how do you volunteer is it through or because I don't see this anywhere
so people like us cannot cannot set up like cannot help
mmhmm
oh
lah
mm
mm mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya that's true
cause I think at their age the more they want to be
mm mmhmm
mm
ya
mm
you was hoping that your parents or any elderly will know how to use um handphone because that is the only communication that you can use especially when you really want to see the other person because but unfortunately most of um our parents doesn't know how to use it lah
mmhmm
mm
though
mm
then
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mm mm
mm mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
I mean shiok lor
free lah to do whatever they want but of course within that eight person limit
mm
mm
ya
eh
oh
oh
mm
mm
oh social distancing ambassador
mm
uh huh
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm oh
mm ah
uh huh
mm

okay
especially during
you will your transitioning from a civilian into a soldier and then like
you have to throw everything away and then like you lost your rhythm ah
so ya and then like
okay lah they teach you a lot about like
ah regimentation and discipline which you are really not use to
it's miserable lah everytime I'm working right ya
so you have anything that like interesting you want to ask
ah that's what I used to think lah because
when I when I became a recruit at tekong I thought it's going to be the hardest part of my life ah
but honestly when
into inventory
is basically ah
it's like it's like way way way harder
is like times ten ah
like even though you got your privileges like you can keep your hair a bit
and then you are treated nicely what
no no
when I went to kranji camp into inventory unit right
so basically I'm treated well I'm treated better but the exercises are getting way harder
sly
is like
even even though you are treated fairly ah but the the exercises are even more like strenuous
ya
ya
ah basically you are treated like
like less than human ah
then
but not as often
ya way better ah but
I even though is hard right
is the I think once I right
I will really miss it ah all the achievement that I have right
ya it's like I didn't expect that
like I managed to go through it
ya
ya one year pass by what
is like I have a bear with it
so ya but I got a lot of achievements ah is something that I didn't expect that I can do
is like is really like
break your
your capabilities what you are capable of
ah
ya okay
okay so
basically my
achievement right okay
when I
before I the twenty four not much
from the first day we move up from five
and we finish the next day at two working with all the maximum load with all weapons and
and then I'm left with like
four kilometres left right to the marina float
cannot even feel my own legs ah
it's like
like is the most miserable thing ever
but the thing that makes you like really push on because you know that your family is going to see you
so I uh
and then like
you know that someone is waiting there
and then like and then the the fun thing is
and then I I let them um try on my bag ah my full pack
hmm all ah
all of them
and then like oo no I don't want to carry this again
and then okay lah that is that is twenty four K that is so big ah
and then
the another one is when I got my green beret
um
the send us out
to lim chu kang cemetery
at three three or two thirty
and then I was inside the bus looking out the window
I'm like oh my god S A F
who who who who who does things like these two come on and then is two until like
that same day eight we didn't even stop
ya and then at eight at night that is where they presented us our beret then like
wah shiok ah hmm
hmm
happy of course lah
if is like you will not just happy that we got the beret because we are happy with
I don't want to do that thing anymore that's why we are happy when we we are the most happiest when we are inside the civilian bus back to get camp
it's like aircon imagine in jungle
and then like soft cushioned your your transitioning from laying down on the soil
err
uh is that bad you know one of my friend who
you know about tekong water
the our water doesn't come from new water it comes from a reservoir from tekong
and the water have err certain minerals that is good for you
is very nature lah and then it's straight from the reservoir to the water cooler
and it taste it taste like ugh it taste so bad
and then there's this one point where during the confinement week my buddy the toh
ah you don't know err military term toh that means ah basically you pass out ah or you just fall out ah some sort like that
during exercise no no he just wasn't feeling well and he passed out on the first parade
so he was sent out
and then err he
and then in the few days he head back and then he ask me eh you want to taste singapore water or not
it's like
because that plain water is so nice
and tekong isn't the duh eh ya
oh eh ah
but okay lah
army life is
is fun but
you know you don't want to be a soldier ah
no it will get harder from here your your infant your inventory kan is
like you are
even even our
who's that guy's name our
brigade ah
wah so I forgot his name his position lah
ah
brigade ah you say
like is a dog's life ah inventory is just a dog's life
is is expected everyone like suffer
you to ask is the
one of the worst vocation to be in ah
because like
they say it's a singaporean son experience ah
ya
and then once you finish
uh six november
two thousand twenty one is still a long way to go
oh ya ya ya
you want to know ah okay so basically
err I want to
basically I'm going to be jobless for the first six months ah
and then um
I will be training my girlfriend
first six months ya ya because basically
I I want to do a portfolio ah
like if you um
take my
if you hire me as your coach ah
so ya I want to be like a trainer ah
the isn't isn't is not is
it's a future that is not promise to you
like if as if like you have a job when you have a job like all your promise like are going to get paid monthly just
you just follow orders and just do your your own stuff and then
but this one is like you are not confirm that you going to make it or not
so is very stressful
so it's like
it's like you're gambling you're gambling it away ah you gambling all your savings away ah
I like that's why I like trying to save up money for my after life
so ya
and I plan to also
compete
um
compete err
national like lah ah eh not national
err like
a classic
classic bodybuilding ah
and then like
why why would should I wasted I have been training for ten years
and I should make the experience worth it and then like complete
so everyone know who I am
what
yes of course
a'ah
how long will it take
for me to get the physique I really wanted
assure already competitions like ah showed any physic
after you only I can build back by six months
because
there's such thing as muscle memories since I lost my muscle to
so it's like I can build back everything or even better in six months
so like
handsome ah
okay
okay
um
um ya
okay
hmm
oh damn
okay but
sorry what
err
okay lah some sort lah
okay
um
so basically your
home based business ah
okay
means okay lah singaporean pursuit what
hmm
will I am black eyes peas
ah
will progress ah
ah
so if you are successful in your selling of clothes
hmm
no no no no no what I mean is
if your business is like a daily product progressively successful right
okay
hmm
hmm
hmm um
there will be any other platform that will take over what
ya but right now like facebook is killing it ah
like but there will be a day where facebook will die out and then other social media social media platform that will take over
tiktok tiktok
oh but no no I never use tiktok ah to me
ya
alah
why
ah but
the funny right is like
two out of ten eh
so is like two of them
or one sometimes is one one of them is funny and then another nine of them right you keep pressing
the tap the screen to skip when like nine of it is like you watch and then it's not funny at all then you waste you time
then
okay swipe up lah sorry lah that I saw people use tiktok right is basically like that after one thing they show another thing they show another thing and then like
and then like the first one is funny and then the other nine is not and then you are wasting your time I rather like use youtube because you can learn a lot from it
like what you want to learn about
like recently
I learnt about err
like photography and photoshop
so basically err after I
during the like
the stages where I'm trying to build my portfolio and
trying to get ready for competition right
err like
really like edit pictures really well photography like
quality studio near
quality ah
so it's like I get like followers ah
err it's like honestly eh
what I heard from my member as duh
come forward to tell like eh I'm training people people approach him so what if right you you're the person that give your service
and then ya can you imagine
no ya it's a good idea and then
ya ya
ya is like very popular
gym shark
hmm mm
ya lah yoga pants lah oo what lah shaker bottle
supplements before and
after is everywhere is like I'm literally everywhere and
to me
every account is very boring some of them like
there's instances where we have
where
it's it's about bodybuilding much he's funny
but
I want to make a instagram account where
where I want to show the world and hey bodybuilding is more than just a sport is a lifestyle and art
so when I take photos I would like take photos like as if
you know those seventies era black and white photos there's like
like like like really good looks like statue is artistic is like very artistic so that is what I want to do is I think is very different ah
ya
ya
that's why I want to buy a soft box
you know those ah
the basically like a umbrella and then there is a light bulb inside
and then the light bulb like really shines like
and then like so it's look like really good ah that's why I also want to buy new phone
eh S twenty is good ah
oh no to me
technology now kan
technology now is to the point where
it's so good especially phones
can be anything like what's the point of buying calculator and having inside your phone what's the point of having like
video camera when your phone is like
you also want to travel like
you don't want to
walk around with a backpack
with a your your and then another lands and then you have your phone and then you need to have a spare battery for your camera
so technology right now is like
is good ah how is progressing ah
ya ya mm S twenty plus ah
I I decided to buy a S twenty plus instead of S twenty ultra
photo focus issue
and then S twenty plus is the same performance as ultra so
so ya it cost only I think eight hundred plus
nine hundred
but
ya
just the phone itself
ya so get that phone ah I bet you like taking photos right
mm
okay
okay
okay ya ya you need like a
you need a phone camera that has
no just ask them any camera phones that
because
when customers look at your live right
and then use this the quality of the view and they see the hear the audio
if it's both good they're willing to stay
most of the time right like those new customers they won't stay in because they barely can hear them and the speaker the microphone is like
ya but you need to up your game ah
right when you think about it you need to up your game also like
what like your camera quality lah
ya
oh
um mm
okay
okay eh but if you plan to upgrade your phone right
then what type of phone do you want
this olympic athlete he is the
ya
kan
oh ya ya like if you have like like a premium
collection or what kan
there's like one clothes is like sixty dollars
then the shipping price is like worth it
can you imagine if the shipping price is higher than the actual dress people like huh why would I do that
why would I do that
okay
okay
okay
but
that means you need good lighting is not the camera
okay
don't use V S C O it's not good use photoshop
okay
mm
troublesome ah
photoshop you can get it for free
over time you'll get so good at it that you don't have to even think
mm
photoshop no lah you need you need that's why I told you is practice you ask a person let say into photography you ask ah
can you edit a
can you put my ear on my forehead
serious you just need practice
um
ya lah
I used to use photoshop ah once you know like how to do it
it's okay lah it's just arrange and repeat
okay okay lah then mm ya of course
mm
body shop eh
okay
ya is
what's going to be ah huh I can't wait I'm left with like one more year
oh man I can't wait
because after that I will finish my tech
you know you know wis a tech
a tech is basically the final exam so basically
um we go to war
with another company
the full of the company full of food just regulars like regular sign on
men
and
their life really
so is like you're fighting against people that really know the jungle
so ya and high chance that you will die
so and is quite quite long lah but what I heard is that whenever they say paradise now right
after like a tech right you know what's a paradise now
it means mission complete so when they say paradise now means
ah then you're done already ah
it's now it's paradise you have nothing to worry about them
the last two months of your right
should be everyday
what I heard is

on sunday
um like midnight I think I hopefully ah
and then I woke up the next day at three
so basically I
I'm staying overnight ah
mm
ya that's basically our job alah
like thirty percent of is also is becoming a cleaner
I'm not kidding
is
you know there's there's no cleaner in a camp
we are the cleaners
there's no cleaner at all
um except for canteen
we clean it
some sort like specialised thorough cleaning
where soldiers are we not like ah
they don't hire us specially for
but we have always to clean toilet ah every week
every week clean toilet clean bunk clean corridor clean gym
clean clean lamp clean parade square
mm
you you have to clean oh kitchen what right
mm
mm
your practical practical kan
of course lah is
your
I bet there would be
labelled for doing certain things like for example
like um in camp
we have one idiot
mm
okay
um
ya lah you what secondary school eh
college
mm
mm
mm
okay
okay
confirm you the most irritating one I bet
shy one
mm
wah
luckily you're not in army sia
because they have things like this
like um like my position is like I'm
second in charge in for company eh no no
uh platoon six
so basically I'm some sort like under the
is like you have to do jobs like as you
you are a sergeant
and then
everytime before we move out for a mission
they have like a briefing briefing room only two will be there
so basically our commanders will give us what to do how to attack everything
like they they draw on the whiteboard
and then
after that we go back to our what section
and then we'll build them
um
I no
I wanted to be I wanted to be a commander not a two
I wanted to lead because of the pay
right now I lead I have the same pay as a trooper
okay okay
hmm
mm
ya lah
I know
depends on the depends on your bully
depends on to what extent
and then
when because
everytime everytime like
whenever he's he's trying to chase a girl
he will put on this like this personality
like okay there's this one time
wah he says skater
that's because he wants to impress someone
so funny like what
is is like ah
like I really miss my life ah
um what do you mean which one li only have one life ya
oh two campus ah no but I love my life ah choa chu kang
that that one you ah cannot blame your stupidity lah
because you you don't want to said it like I live at choa chu kang then I go back to balestier when there's a choa chu kang campus there ya lah
so I agree lah you agree to my statement ah thank you so much nurse nurse is see me
oo but college central is such a big school eh
once I went there to collect my award after like I graduated right
err my my my brain is like melted when I saw that school
why
um
that's why I love primary school it's so cute so small
and then like your class so near and then yay recess and then it's like what
or at least one minute away
at least I hate my poly life lah
they can that one campus there's like five canteen
and then every single canteen is far
and it's crowded the food is not nice is expensive
and then so stuffy
it's such a horrible school I hate singapore poly singapore poly is the worst school level
is
is I repeated one year because I'm just not interest
like to me right
is like progressing way better than poly well to me like one day like
one day like a diploma in polytechnic will be so obsolute
like I learn a lot from even though it's two years and my poly is like four years I retain a lot of knowledge when I was in
but back in poly ah it's just that I have to study this just to pass
that's the mentality of it so is not really a good school
and then like there's a lot of assignments so is like
you don't really have your own time lah outside ya
that is ya I have a diploma in electrical electronic engineering but
that you you I told you already that what I want to do after right
but that diploma is basically just to
is a backdrop career so like if at all else failed right
I have something lah
that I can
work lah but
honestly I don't want to ah I don't want to be electrical engineer
eh in in may seem like a electrical technician it may seem easy job but I don't want I don't it is just not me I just love bodybuilding that's it like I felt that I was born to body build
like when I was young right even before I started lifting weights when I see like heroes like arnold schwarzenegger at when I was like really young was like or inspired
that was like I was eight years old
and it's like
wah
there's a lot of foreign talent
like I want to stand out from the crowd
I want to be that guy
I don't want to be just a normal person
like is blended altogether in society I just want to stand out
ya
okay
oh ya ya
um ya right now singapore you are competing with foreign talents
because in the end wins right
um
P P
is like
why why why would you spend that amount of money on private
ya
those are those people who have like private diploma
once they get a job
you must really stick to the job for quite a long time
so like by the time move to the second job right people want to hire you based on your experience ya but initially is hard
that's why like why boasts about or within three months all our students got a job
that's what like to boost especially ya
the ya the banner
on top right
and then they always boast like that seventy percent of our students got a job within three months of graduating
mm
is it like your your challenging the students
it's very hard
ya but it's hard ya
because they don't know what they learn
because okay
when you go to
is a government you know government school eh let's say for example most everyone went to and they know what is taught there
but but your is different
ya
but is is NITEC
but why is it
I thought you only I thought you will just only saying this because of like
culinary jobs
sorry my mistakes
okay
um ya
singapore is quite messed up ah
this one the reason why a lot of citizens
feel like they don't belong in singapore
right
ya
ya but but singapore is good because it's such a safe place
that's the good but
singapore right I think it's progressing so fast
that people cannot keep up
can tolerate that way
look at
okay singapore progress in fifty years
in fifty plus years of third world country officiating port in the world like a first world country okay
you see ah
because we progress so fast ya ya but when you look at overseas right those people at of aged right they can use like
they are able to cope because their progressing slowly
like
when was america found it
like what year was it is more than a hundred years right
it's more than a hundred years but singapore you become third world to first world in like fifty years that is very fast people cannot keep up
see how stressful it is
it's like not a lot of people like
um
ya ya
but okay lah what
I think like
the next generation you won't feel so far
hopefully
stone aged stone aged ah like indonesia

if your job is just that you you also would do it what like looking forward to it
if no money
if no money

so it's all about you
want to
disrupt other people's family or what then you know their plans

then
eh then then okay then if example eh
then imagine if papa want to pass away then she then he have to pass down or whatever shit
if have to pass down to females we are the only two
I don't know
male female
then would you take it
if it if they have to pass down to female
then that means I have to take it
why
why can't you sacrifice for me
why can't you sacrifice for me
half half
no should take like
on
on even weeks
of the year follow me on odd weeks of the year follow you
ya
no but
I don't know
it's like we have to
that's what that's what my friend say also
because I like to go to these kind of places what
all the haunted places

all of us saw
and it was like literally like just
hung uh
hanging like
around me cause we were when I was sitting there at the porch
it's me and another two friend
no eh they were asking me black figure then I was like no like it's you can't blame me there's two other
people beside me and
out of out of like
three of them can see things
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
mm what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
ah
then like eh
I don't know
sometimes I feel like I want to go and ask
I feel like I just want to know whether I have something with me or not
eh no he got nine wives so so I you be ten then I'll be eleven
no the lina's cafe is not his it's one of his wives
I don't want to
number eleven is more prettier than me

how old nineteen years old
and she's not even plastic excuse me not like kardashian

no they said there's a reason for that because of the underwear you use also

it's too hot
then the japanese man was like sweating profusely already and he was already so drunk he can't even walk straight anymore

so
so I ask you a question
okay so nabilah how was your day
nice ya talking about it right
like I totally forgot about it I was like
resting
then I totally forgot that she texted
then I felt bad then I told my mum about it lah I was like
oh the is still trying to convince me to like um for her
I was guilt tripped
ya
that's about it and I'm excited for the zoom meeting
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya
so let me tell you how my day went
we're going out at one
tomorrow which is today
cause like
we wanted to go spotlight and then we want to go
but then
at
okay I woke up at eight
and then like I was too tired so
I continued today
ya so I woke up at eight when I slept at two
then I fell asleep
freaking six ya
busy you know cause okay
family members kan
then
err
but my another
dress patterns lah the one that I told you about that I wanted to
make
kan
so
the first thing I did was
and then I was like flabbergasted I don't know why
but I was like super
anxious and then and then I walk you know like the entire spotlight
and I forgot to take the the pattern
and err and then like uh I tried to find the pattern then like I I I went around like the entire
spotlight but I couldn't find it
like a drawer
like in front of a
counter
and then I was like am I allowed to like just pull this out
I didn't know cause no one was
no one was attending to me ah so I just like
so I just like did it myself
ya that's about it I will show you but it will make like
sounds
which is
not ideal ya
ya that's about it lah
ya
ya
hello
that's call cheat
ya
small kan
usually it's like this
but have the circular containers lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
like while I was
bathing
it's very noisy at my neighbourhood
like super noisy
and then
like sometimes I stay up until like five and stuff like that kan
like the freaking
am I allowed to say that huh like the the motor and the and the cars are like
ya
ya
mmhmm
but I think it's because of our neighborhood though
cause
it's quite
it was
close to this timing and it's quite quiet lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya
it's the it's the app that you told me about right that time since
I haven't checked it out ya
apart from school
ya
mmhmm
was it
I feel like that's like a lot of my friendships though like with irfan zahidah
once every
twice a month or something
huh
oh ah
like two to three months
ya
by who
blanks
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
yes
like it's quite
like hats off to them lah
cause I watch like the it's okay to not be okay kan
like
there's a castle in the
series in the series
and
my sister told me that it's
it's a set
it looks very
you know some some sets you know that it's a set kan
like you can know that
I I I haven't watched so I wouldn't know but ya like
it looked
like a legit castle
and I think
it's really
err
it's really
oh my god uh I cannot uh my brain is like fried it's really impressive lah
but then again they've been like
they're they're quite big lah in the industry so
it's not really surprising I guess
that's why I like
ya
mmhmm
mm
I've never
heard of him though what's his name
I shall look him up
mm
mm
ya ya
okay let's talk about
let's follow the prompts lah hor
let's talk over the worst
is it is it the worst
one for one
eh buy one get one free thing yes
okay you want to start first
mmhmm
ya ya
makes sense food
ah aiya okay
so you know the one of the specs that I
so the reason why it's
and then
one for one specs lah like at at that point of time I was like thinking
you can buy one for yourself and then the other one you can
like someone can just get it for free lah for free
which is technically not free cause like
four hundred for a pair of glasses is really ridiculous
ya
so um
this was like a discussion between me and my family like after that heated
err
exchange not really heated exchange it was just him telling us that
he cannot do anything about it because of the sweat
but it was a heated argument eh discussion between me and my
like we were like
like
it doesn't makes sense for someone
for you to like get a one for one glasses
like normally people will just like have one
like if if they have another one it's just for
I don't know at home
do people do that wear different glasses at home
my sister does that lah but
but like
the reason why you change your glasses is because
I don't know
and
it all
like
ya
I'm doing like a lot of like
hand gestures pe ya like
who one for one
but I think like owndays
err
if you see ah the people who who buy glasses from owndays kan they also keep on changing their glasses
the quality is still like
not that good for them to keep on changing
but it I don't know maybe it's a paid sponsorship or what
but ya
owndays started the whole like
glasses um spectacle shops are following following it lah
but to compromise the quality though and for the price
I think it's not worth it
buy one
ya cause before that kan usually ah specs
engage a staff then they will open for you then they will take out
then you try on
but when this is like you just like
human interaction
like lesser human interaction
ya
there they like
prepare a box where like you can put
to
like you can put after you try lah so that they can sanitise kan
and then
I was looking at like other customers ah and then there's this like two girls who were trying on the glasses
didn't even follow the protocol like they try and then they put back they didn't even put the in the
box thing
and then I was like what
did you not see that box there with a sign that like
you have to put in in there
I don't know ah
I feel like a lot of people are not like taking it seriously and it's kind of
worrying
especially like when I see people going out in like
more than five
mmhmm
a'ah ya
ya
ya
that's the thing that my dad say also ah the other day
he was like
you know the migrant cases thing
there there there are more cases than they reported because like
the only reason the reason why they
to make people feel secured
ya like
because they have to do
they have to
ya
then I'm like
I mean I guess that's like
what a lot of countries are doing also lor I I mean
I wouldn't know but I suspect
ya
cause like it's all because of
mm
ya
oh my god
we're not even halfway through
ya
oh ya talking about it
ya
wanting to become a journalist right
I was exactly like you sia I was like in sec
two or three I think like
during my parents' divorce
I was like oh my god I want to like
write
about women empowerment and like
like writing
because of the
it's it's because of like the nature of it lah ya
ya I mean media right like
is meant to be two faced
ya
ya
ya
ya
but I think
like that whole thing
phenomenon started because of
this whole
if you work harder that means you are more hardworking kind of
stereotype kan
ya but like that's the sad that's the sad thing lah like it's so normalized that like
if you say you're tired
as compared to somebody else and then they'll be like huh why are you so tired
ya
it's a very asian thing but I don't know about other parts of the world I guess
as long as
capitalism is involved
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
as in cause you wouldn't know if it's like it's going to
so you're like
I trust the economy
I'm just going to take out my money before the economy go down
that kind of things
ya
my
I should do that when I work I should buy shares and like stuff like that
but I'm like
isn't that gambling
mm
ya
I guess it depends
on the individual lah
and their self control I guess
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
we literally like move wait what
so
and I think we were not supposed to talk about that
wait wait let me check
huh
I mean
hopefully we won't be penalised lah cause we were not like
shitting on anything or what it's just like a general discussion
ya
honestly I haven't thought of that before
ya it's something to it's something for me to like look into lah to like read and then
I feel like I haven't been reading much I have been on tiktok
for the entire break
it's this small like ya
I can tell from the number of tiktoks you send me
is she on tiktok also
nice
mm
uh huh
ya
ya
ya
I feel like
and the
like I like tiktok cause there's a lot of content on there
but I feel like
it's kind of exhausting
like
like it's getting exhausting lah cause like
they keep on
giving you
different um
like if you go on tiktok and then like you accidentally press
the top button like use scroll all the way to the top or like press the top thing
and like it's good because it's giving people it's giving content creators like a platform
from the consumer
point of view it's kind of like exhausting that's why I haven't I haven't been on tiktok
for like a while
scroll for like one two hours now it's just half an hour and I'm done
like it's I mean
that's the thing about the algorithm thing lah
like I keep getting the same
type of content
but different no
I showed you about the tinder algorithm
mmhmm
wow
uh huh
maybe that's why you've been seeing jufri
no
it's either it's either he's so attractive
or like
I have no idea
mmhmm
ya
also cause I go post
followed all your friends
ya
it's like if he if he cannot like get you he will try for your friends kind of thing you know
mmhmm

mmhmm
mm
it's so weird
like a family member and like people know you
and then you start to like
dude

mmhmm
uh huh
oh my god
mmhmm
oh my god
I guess it's his kink or something
like indonesian girls
ya
maybe they have like
an idea of like what
they going to like serve him or something that's why he wants a maid
ee I hate guys like that
uh huh like
ah
mmhmm
ee
and and the thing is
each like
ya
I mean cause it's their passion right that's why they're like a chef in the first place
ya
ah
it's it's it's a big kind of
like stay away from me
mmhmm
like even if they don't have
do you not have goals in life
ya that was what like
like a lot of guys I
met before is those like
oh or because you are too educated for me and all that kind of stuff like oh you're too ya I don't deserve you you don't
I don't deserve you kind of thing then I'm like
like stop putting your insecurities on me like
I shouldn't be like responsible for that lah ya
ya
mmhmm
ya

ah that one her business just started on February seh
she went down to the shop she saw her husband
ya she talked to to ah the person lah the Aminah but she never talked to the husband lah
ya she was there
no she only have seventy dollars like what
I mean but but we are so lucky that we are we never take a lot lah eh
ours is below three hundred so she can refund us on the spot for two hundred sixty
but then again I don't know I until when she's gonna do this cause
at one point she wouldn't have enough money to pay that person and then this thing would be big
mm
three weeks yup three weeks before us this week is fourth week ah fourth month uh fourth week
mmhmm
oh in fact she mmhmm
ya ya true
then suddenly become her husband delivery friend whatever
but when ya when she when she messaged the supplier the direct Thai supplier cause she is the one who gave Aminah Muslim this number the contact lah so
that's why
kan so she is going to go babe this kind of thing eh once you do this kind of thing eh maybe you get shiok with it ah you get carried away with this scam kan but the you still can pay is okay you know but once you cannot pay ah that's it your name will be viral all over the social media I'm telling you honestly
kan
mm oh really
where you saw outside or
mmhmm
she selling at twenty two dollars or something like that if I'm not wrong
but but but then again uh they take from the same supplier the one that I order lah

mmhmm like ours ah like the ruffle dress I thought that would be a hit but then the ruffle dress is the most difficult to sell actually
kan
mmhmm no the side the mermaid part
but it's very very hard to sell lah I don't know why
ah like like ya
ah yes yes like Natalie Bella you see Natalie Bella she's selling the same stuff and then she put on influencer you know what I mean

mmhmm

ah she wants to quit her job yes
alright then after that seeing that art seeing that people can actually sell the dress then she suddenly twisted her her mind again fickle-mindedly wanted to sell dress again
mm
she offered she offered but I don't want
knowing her you see how different ah from that live with my live
mmhmm
anyway if I do for her it's I never come out the money what
right so she is the boss

ya it's err very bare minimum nothing really to see a lot we don't get to see alter we only get to see the model
ya
and it's moving definitely that's why I'm like away from me just in case
when the moment you say that what if it's gonna jump I'm like oh god okay I'm gonna back off girl back off now
you
damn
oh my god they can
oh damn damn
ya I think I was very young let me see primary school then we went to the zoo that was very small also so when I look at it the alligator like the biggest thing I've seen in the tank like super huge to me
I was like fuck this is like what a dinosaur alligator or what
ya and I will most like lead my way towards where they gonna feed the crocodile cause I didn't know that is like a way for the for the rangers rather than for the people
and then they have to shout like come down what you doing there come back now oh there's where we feeding the alligator come down oh no cause I was like run back down
mengheadache
err
chey
hmm
like
it's very nice to see elderly people going around and walk
I think botanical garden is known as like we had in our adventures in pulau ubin or macritchie because it's really a trail walk
narrow and and like there's only one or two people can squeeze in you know one walkway
ah there's crazy monkey out there so be careful they were fighting and I almost like strangle around cause I was still scared
I was like grabbing her neck I didn't realise that just crazy
she is gonna be conjuring two
ya that's crazy
ya
mm
I'm in a mess I'm in panic mode
ya so
I just
so one day when she's going to macritchie I got slapped on my face by a monkey so ya
but not the older one
you have a lot of acts a lot of emotion has developed
and they're trying to steal your bottles you don't bring any food or drinks you know
pulau ubin
ya
the mangrove
monkeys ya
no eh
uh oh no
hop on her bag
ya
ya
bottle cap
because he's very sneaky you know I assume it's a he lah I don't see the bird bird or what you know
they were on the rail bridge and then the monkey look at me
so I'm just going to like okay I just shut up let him do his business so the monkey go and took the bottle water away
mmhmm
okay
alright
oh
mmhmm
mmhmm
what the heck
okay
alright
oh
oh my god
oh my god
ah ya ya ya
mm mm mmhmm
it's crazy
oh my god
oh my god
what do you do
wah this teacher scold
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
ears
okay
uh huh
ah
mm mm
uh huh uh huh
to whack ah uh
oi
ya
ya
it's crazy you know
it's crazy offended by animals and talking about animal I don't really like we'll never in my life going to feed the ostrich
the beak is like
really ah
I went I went ostrich farm
then
ah
they don't really like um sharp
you feel like painful or what
that must be a gentle ostrich K the one I went is a malaysia ostrich
and the baby like bathing the babies
but we don't really get the kangaroo to
come and
is it birds
I like the ducks
well ya man when are we gonna travel back
uh huh
nowhere nowhere travel
so that's why they got a cruise or either an airplane by
there's a
you can hop in to nowhere mainly just around the singapore
but there is a waste to do that so I rather do staycation which I'm still reconsidering whether it's worth it or not
staycay we've been doing that in now we can't go there at all
I was
ya
for the living room gonna have leh
ya
don't have to go far
ya but but do you think that
once it's reopened do you think it's safe for singaporean to go
what's your thought
that's one
mmhmm
oh
that's gonna take a longest time
that's dangerous ah
now cause
oh my god that's crazy and there was like towards the last before it closes down
that's crazy
I hope that
oh what do you think what happen if you decided to stay rather than come back
but
you get on board and come back in time
twelve sia
just crucial
ya
you know like how disruptive their businesses is having not singaporean coming for them like from their transportation taxis and what else ah food err shopping outlets whatever the business there is like damn affected of not us coming there
so when you come back I think I felt that where they will last to settle in but on the same time I felt that fight of crime might be higher
thirst and gone hunger for
months without good you know
food on the table or what you know and
ya so they might wanna do something a little bit more negative
you just waiting for chances
ya
mm
mmhmm
they have the
assertion
two weeks
mm higher
it's actually it's been like one month or two I didn't really keep track of what's happening about COVID
it's getting vary and
I don't know lah what else to track like when for me it's like when is this thing will be over
ya
the was ah
the worst pandemic
and I can't believe that that that stupid orange hair go and go and got himself lah he got COVID and then cured after few days the hell
hospitalised
ya
kan
ah
uh huh
same ya
phase two
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think the annoying part is like okay ah aside from business lah like how the work function now is
so um
thing should become a bit a bit more different or low expectation
okay like I know we can be a bit more creative about working on things but on the same time shouldn't expect much about how many gonna be anticipate on this cause it's the time that everyone gonna go be chaos
and you know like those especially the loose of job or even if they have job is like a better stay or stick around the job you know I'm gonna do properly
so people are no more playing around you know and and they will likely prioritise your commitment ah rather than other things
so ya I think certain thing you have to be a bit more flexible lah
both
ya so I don't mind like working
few days and four days at home or vice versa
I mean only some maybe that requires for you to be there physically
ya of course err because of your work function ah but other than that if there's not a need then I felt that work from home is the best way to go
ya
it's the worst thing what happen
ya but if you work in
semi government or what maybe a bit more strict
like if you
if you are really needed in the office you just have to come back in the office oh
it depends on your work already mah
ya
ya
mm
yup
ya
ya especially I think weddings ah weddings most affected ah
a batches
ya so we got our friend wedding coming up in november
err but eventually I think we they she have to be very selective lah who to invite you know you can't even like if invite those in couples or family those with kids no longer you just if you know the person one person and you just invite at one person ah that kind of thing ah but also she can't be very
restrict lah about two who would potentially can be invited
um
it's just err sad lah didn't get the chance to see that's all about it ya other than that of course we gonna wish everything is the best
cause it's who doesn't want to have like you know like at a dream wedding
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
yup
mmhmm
ya
um hmm
ya must come to terms lah
so I think in this pandemic is not a good time to get married
because it's chaos
really
ya man things are harder during pandemic what else was affected
the the the fact that I also like after I climb the stairs then afterwards I feel out of breath wearing the mask
ya have to
you know you're like
and then like the air at the air is like in your mouth eh it's not breathing out
ya
I see so so the elderly like most affected to it so they'd rather stay home and when they stay home too long also it's problem cause they don't really being active outside
mentally also so they always I think now they gone crazy with social media and Facebook Instagram all this or YouTube
it's the best thing for them lah
social media the next thing ah
so I think they are becoming like the oldest millennial
millennial like a little bit too late but it's getting there for for not a good reason
ya in their fifties and nineteen forty seven
I'm like fifty something ya and then now they started to like uploading things on Facebook try to get to know the the the rad the world of online it's madness
kan but okay what do you what do you what do they normally watch
old songs
me watch
uh huh
me watch is not really friendly user I felt like you you know you must know lah a lot of scrolling ah I felt
they can still not not bad
ya talk about dad my dad is crazy with hindustan
so he's been watching an app
hindustan movies my mum like crazy about the whatever is happening in indonesian so she almost know every celebrity in indonesia itself and talk about their lives this one split lah this one got new babies lah this one wah she can tell me the whole story
oh
ya
ya that's a thing I wanna watch today now we are left with some close to seven minute okay what what is yours now
I have six thirty six
excuse me
bear my burp
no that's not my burp I was like err yes
ya
ya
then it's like oh you're not talking in err english now I'm talking in english yo
ya
we're like trash out
ya I have no idea and uh
stage of fifty fifty

second child
same as you ah
but you guys haven't fought right okay lah
cause they say like you know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
oh
I think it will take a while lah
one year
K lah
um I think one year okay maybe six months ah
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
like
right ya so he is
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
mm
mm so
mm
mm
mm
oh
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
but does he know what he want to do
mm
mm mm
mm
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
mm
ya I mean take a risk ah if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
kan I mean that's what I would do lah
then um okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of ah
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly lah what kind of course he wants cause like
mm
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
oh okay okay
there's a master's in uh lasalle
uh err east asian studies
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
I think that it's okay lah like
cause if you just study jer kan

ya so it's it's it's it's not easy ah
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
mm
mm mm mm
okay two years ah

ya
don't stress

mm
ya I know
okay so like what do you guys get
uh uh

mm
mm
mm
then you barbecue yourself or what
oh K
oh K K ya lah like buffet lah then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
mm ya ya ya
eh but no barbecue pineapple is nice
oh
oh because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly lah I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
aww it tasted like meat ya
mm
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
even when it was um
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
take them afterwards after the first one
um
ah seh or you can go with us lah like me and uh me and hafiz so you as in
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also lah then at least there's some a bit of
mm
mm
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay lah so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that lah obviously
really ah
like
how how bad is it
it is
they had like the music
err show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
mm
mm
uh
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover seh
like even
if they they recover like if johor is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
to get back up
ya
if
ya like I think like
ya
mm
mm
ya
like from what it looks they are not
ya india is like one of the worst I think
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
uh uh
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it lah
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck ah ah cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
mm
ya
ya
uh uh
ya ya ya
mm
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad ah
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
ah luck luckily like mm I alighted much like err quite fast lah so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
uh
uh huh
ya
ya
mm
ya
uh
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit uh
uh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
uh huh
mm
mm
okay
uh
okay
uh
uh and just be aunties lah
ya ya ya ya
mm mm
uh uh seh
uh uh
ya
mm
ah ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like oh my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to ah ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
ya december twenty nineteen
mm
that's why then I'm like also like
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm how how their conditions were right
oh my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
uh
uh
uh
mm
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb jer ah cause no choice kan ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order ah law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then err some people made a a like sarcastic kind of err remark it's like err go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this one they say go to hospital because they found out like
uh
uh
that time ah
ya ya
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like err you you don't you can't transmit anything lah so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work seh
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more leh then I'm like oh my goodness
uh
this kind of like way to combat right uh uh it's like I read it I cannot forget seh then I keep telling people then people like
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous

I've been doing well lah actually what about you
wah actually it was not bad leh like uh at first
uh I thought like I'll have a lot of problems but actually it was quite smooth
Law and Literature so ya very interesting
then uh you in what school now
a'ah
oh so uh what course
oo that's interesting
mm
mm
mm
true
then
mm
um floorball
ya it's a very interesting sport
oo then what type of sport do you prefer then
mm
mm
hmm
alamak
eh
mm
mm
then
mm
it's a unique course I would say
ya and err this course is like it appeals to me lah because I also I really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and I
mm
oo so
oh so recently I just uh finish my semester one so some of the courses I sorry I mean modules I picked was
I did was uh design and colour so I do like graphic designs and stuff and I also uh besides coding I also learn uh concept
oo that's not bad
yeah that's poly life man like most of the time you are just like spending time with your friends doing project work
internship eh
oh
true
oh
oh
wah
like during that that test
oh right
mm
oh
that's that's interesting I think you will do very well lah
yeah
don't worry I think with all the skills you are equipped with confirm you
ah
mm
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally uh do uh my hobbies
yeah
yep
go for the trials err because I um I'm actually afraid of rejection
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then um so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
wah how was it
yeah
oh for what
oh
mm
ah
yeah
mm
oh
wow
ya man I can't imagine myself
wah all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
then
uh other than
then right you you said that you had your I mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so uh how
oh
yeah
I
eh then oh
eh you go first
ya
yeah
yeah
ah small business
no no no you you meant ah calligraphy is it
oh yeah yeah
yeah eh
mmhmm
ih
oo
wah wah tell me more
yup
list them all
oh
oh
ya ya Gold Coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
true
ya
ya
ya true true
wah for me right
yes
figurine so I was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
wah I tell you I'm biggest procrastinator eh with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator I I like let's say like
oh
mm
ya uh me also like most of the time is always like cause I
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
uh it can be done but it's just very hard
my course is interaction design kan so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm uh ideas together and then come up with like uh a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting lah because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
uh how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
ya that's about it
for you eh
mm
why kay you tell me
how rabak
wah I legit also don't like this type of people leh like they really make my blood go up eh like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to ah take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works lah
mm
oh
oh I know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
oh
oh that's interesting
ah ya ya
mm
oh that's good that's good
yeah
oh
ya
I think I think it's a it's a good app ah because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our Singaporean society cause like I feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good um for me I think your app is very beneficial lah for people yeah
oo that's good
ya ya ya very interesting eh
mmhmm
mm
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game
wah
that's cool
mm
wah
ya ya ya very interesting
oh
oh
ya
mm
mm
ya ya
mm
and what are some of the
the like
oh ya
ya
wah actually I make friends very instantly eh it's like ya because err okay the good thing about technology is that err
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school lah so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online
ya
you eh what about you
ya
ya from secondary school then to poly
wah my one don't have eh cause COVID then no orientation very damn sad leh
oh
huh really ah
oh
oh I see I see
oh
mm
I I think not bad leh the one that there was one time
I also did flag day it was eight hours it was very hot yes it was eight hours because last time um my I had I had this uh program called like so basically like you have to do like volunteer jobs and then you have to like count in the hours lah then you will get the
it was so hot
ya
ya
mm
right
wah
ya
really ya it is
oh ya ya I've done the morning shift one before it's very very tiring
ya
oh maybe in the future maybe they have more fun orientation we don't know
ya ya ya
ya ya my school my school my school got night party but too bad lah this COVID there ah spoil all the plan eh then like legit man then ah spoil then like I can't even like
like meet my friends right regularly in school have to do Zoom Zoom is also very hard you know it's hard to concentrate but the good thing is like can wake up late
mm
ya thanks for the talk it was was good nice meeting you

okay
so
ya I think movie also can so should be okay
okay
why it is sad like
like ah okay
oh
ah
oh
oh
ah oh
wah
but then how ah like
ya
why so weird
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
oh
uh huh
uh huh
what
but that's really your favourite movie
wah
err
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show oh then ah my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
um they suddenly
um
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
all of them I think almost all of them get married
ya
kan like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young lah so the thing is like he's err like professor in this like
like um over the years kan they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like ah people who are like basically like
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met ah through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
um you know like straightaway
like realise eh tomorrow you gonna get married this person
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world lor
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing lah that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool kan I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker lah don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
oh
oh ya you told me what
oh ya ya the cafe thing then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
oh
wah
oma spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
farrer park ya but the thing is
very circular
actually ya
uh huh
like tough what
but you know
ya but it's not
ya
eh
ya
maybe you are just like picky
tea without sugar can but coffee oh because of the bitterness kan
it's just weird
K lah okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
you can fulfil lah okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so um out of these three kan like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay lah have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
lee kuan yew no ah is it you can be rich I can't remember
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know what
what
okay I think that's a bit far oh
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
mmhmm
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries lah our neighbouring countries lah
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries lah if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore ah no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
like you know
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun kan
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case lah
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot lah hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national railway railway is eh you know the train one
oh my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay lah um
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
no but maybe maybe because like
what you doing there huh uh you never read the sign is it
eh ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like oh my god
like ah like the maid was shocked lah when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya because it's okay lah but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
um you need to
like you can achieve now lah I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy lah to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
huh
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and uh cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia ah and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya lah but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave account
post secondary ah
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya
so can use that
err if it there's one country my wish list lah
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young lah I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like naruto like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing lah last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly naruto come in ya ah pokemon all this you know and then I was like
oh my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
wah
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like osaka kyoto tokyo
and I when nara I went like kanazawa then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no lah I went with my friend but I went um I think I went hiroshima alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter eh wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing lor
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like tokyo and osaka they rarely snow I think
tokyo ya tokyo rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
oh you didn't know I went korea oh my god
I showed you ya
oh my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only ah it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have ah thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no lah I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
wei you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition mah
ya
no lah um I think K because
most of them lah actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so uh it's their first language lah english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
um you know the seoul tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya wei you didn't know I went all these wah it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also lah that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper what
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in temasek my microsoft
korea bought my bags mah
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
ya
oh you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
huh
I feel like going with your friend kan
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went batam with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like oh no I cannot eat it's oh no like this place is
but then he was like then ya and then he was like why why the hotel smell then I'm like
hotel supposed to smell that way you know
and then we went massage right ya like yes then he was like why is the machine like so weak
I'm like
if you are not paying for that full package you know you are paying like twenty dollars for that you know
no I guess not I think
oh ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage lah
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment err one star price then I was like
alamak why you like that
and then um
then then I was like
ya then okay
so okay how about you which country you would like to go
korea
I I'm looking at cause you cannot run what unless you wanna join like fun did you
but korean got nothing much though
eh yo yo america
there's so many things
okay lah but
but you've been to europe turkey was in europe
ya but it is europe
it it they are part of europe
they look you know you know you went to like turkey and then there's they have like the greece infrastructure and everything it looks exactly the same
you know right like you the whole europe have that same infrastructure that you see
ya
but europe is
I think for me is quite boring unless you go like paris
um
yes sightsee
drink coffee
no drink tea you don't like coffee
then you should go you will afal
I think afal entertain you
ya right he will entertain you like
cause of school what you also will be busy next year after you know I don't know it depends where you go
business lah like it's the safest choice
ya
just don't go science
I don't know I think it's
ah nursing
like really nursing

no but the thing is like you know ah inshira
you call her what ah christina or inshira
huh
then I saw his ah her she say very stressful
iskandar also in nursing what
ya
a'ah
no but
very difficult
ya
but it depends lah if you think it's fulfilling then you should go for it
no but it's not easy
but it's stable
it's stable income but there's no progression though
like ya but it's
no I think you shouldn't go nursing eh
but okay lah malinah

ya
what that's so random
no ah we're talking what
you know what but it you cannot do like it's in singlish ya that's why then confirm fail what if you do this kind ya
so it's different ya
so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya I know
I know
ya
interesting lah
like ya
but I think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other kan
ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between kan ya
mmhmm
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a suria actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
mmhmm
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no lah like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya
ya I didn't expect
him
except for me
I never use
ya
the only time I actually use that day was to watch
no ya big bang and then after that I was like oh my god I found a website like no no not not no err because like I my friend bought the whole
I think ya the whole box then my friend give me lend me lah then I watch everything finish then I stopped watching already because the only reason why I watch Netflix is because of that
ya unless I won't use it so actually I wanted to subscribe I tell you ah like I just want to try so I actually could just use the one month free or was it three months but then in the end never lah then you guys all use free I never rely on anyone lah ya I very independent
you know I have always been independent not like you guys isn't it true

therapeutic
ya
oh
wah
ya oh my god okay

okay we can start talking now ah so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also

ya my career futures is a lot of
mendaki have opening but that time they wanted someone with a degree of sociology

it's good full time already now
true lah but okay lah
but it's okay lah crowne plaza now got staycation package mah next time he come over then you can stay staycation package use up the one hundred dollar voucher
mama wants to go for that actually
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook mah mama can cook
but she eat ramen all that
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food

it is nice ya
teleport
err actually I I I said that because like err my I was watching this like interview of my favourite celebrity korean celebrity and she said that so I want to emulate it's hyorin lor hyorin the sistar one

answer politically right answer
I actually saw this err one movie recently on netflix right is called I boy
ya so it's it's inspiring lah I would say inspiring movie I boy the movie title is I boy but he is a high school student high school err high school is it middle school I can't remember okay middle school
like to turn to lah in a sense ya
ya
society society is like what your school your teachers
labels
I think err I think it's is somewhat true lah because I think it is somewhat true because like uh if you were talking about right there's um the number of malay the malay population in is very little ya and some more we are already the minority like err there's not a lot of us err compared to the chinese the chinese people back in school so it's much much lesser
he's always on the ship ya travelling I don't know where but I think err that kind of job is is quite it piece very well especially if you start from young and I don't think he um he is he intends to go uni ah because from what I see his career is pretty much set in place ya so
it will be a very rewarding experience
education ah
ya so I feel like if everyone has equal opportunity uh to have to access err to access uh all these various uh resources I think it will be nice lah for everyone ya not saying that err the elite schools are better than the neighbourhood schools lah I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it will it will be nice if
have a deep interest in school ya because we provide them with all the resources basically resources that they can do lah
mm
ya
in their head ya
equality versus
equality ah
ya I get I get I know ya ya
equity
ya so like if you need more then they give you more if you need less they give you less
everyone has the same amount ya but you are different starting points
oh if it is if it's something in that you could wish is free what would it be
time
err
so you want the world to freeze the time
vampire

I don't I don't know any decent Malay
names cause like
I never actually seen a decent Malay guy
I don't know what what's a nice
what's a nice name can't you just say his name or his name doesn't do justice

then how your mother
um where's the consent at LOL
kay lah not like
not like macam harass lah but like it's just very uncomfortable
no I mean I mean like not to your extent lah but have lah
I don't know
no but I have one in like secondary school also like
I don't know if I got tell you before like I keep forgetting I think I told I told #Wati#</P2 or some shit but like me me and this girl right we met in um
okay we're like two thousand right she's ninety nine
then like I think her brothers like ninety eight I think but then we are all in the same class so I'm just like so confused like like I ask her like why are you older but in my class then she say oh cause like
then
then I knew
I don't know
it was like long long time ago like there were people who like older in my class like by one or two years
but we were in the same class
ya and then after that one day my mom was fetching me right
the in Tampines
ya then after that
then my mom found out like
oh um this girl her name is #Aisyah#</P2 #Aisyah#</P2
Aisyah#</P2>'s mum is actually
my mum's friend
it's like you and me but like not that close but that we had children then our children are like
friends
ya so like me and #Aisyah#</P2 we like
grow up together lah like ever since like that that whole encounter in like primary two so I was like primary two primary three
eh ya ya something like that
ya
ya but they weren't like very close so it's like I think you know eh it's like um
if me and
oh it's like if you and err
how to say ah
ah it's like you and #Sheila#</P2 like
uh got kids and then your your kids and Sheila#</P2>'s kids
like become friends
and then like you become closer to
no no no but they're closer than that
I don't know sia okay like I give up explaining but like whatever yeah they're like quite close lah
yeah so
ya ya ya ya ya then after that
oh my god I miss her ya okay anyway then after that right
stop laughing then after that
then um so like
they have like the macam kids alive teens alive tweens alive
like
ya ya okay so basically it's like an Andalus lah then then they band you according to how smart you are whatever then got the morning session and then the
then the morning session and the afternoon session lah yah so like
I think
I think like
the first few years #Aisyah#</P2 was
um
cause you mix class every time what so you just make friends with everyone in that class
yeah
then
then after that like me and so
so halfway through
uh you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand Malay or anything
the teacher teach in Arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in English and the textbook is in Arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in Malay and then like she just couldn't understand
ya so like
like imagine a literal small #Kahir#</P2 inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows Chinese
yeah
like shoulders then I ask you understand malay meh then he said
yeah it's basically ya food related
but he listens to Malay songs now
okay so so this Camila</P2 girl right okay the chinese girl is named Kayla</P2 then this Camila</P2 girl she
um
um
kindergarten then primary school then secondary school all the way until like you finished poly or whatever lah then
then me and #Aisyah#</P2 went to
Teens aLIVE
eh
is it Teens aLIVE oh ya ya ya secondary school is Teens aLIVE ya then we go to Teens aLIVE right together with her brother and then like coincidentally
two
years
so you imagine all of us like the whole half of a Sunday morning I'm just spending time with her
and her brother and then like we always sit next to each other so like we are
no
okay
hmm can you stop okay then after that
so when #Aisyah#</P2 was in
oh so when we were in sec four right
I think me and her were talking we were like texting texting texting and then like err she she in already what then like we still o-levels right then her brother was in I think
year two poly
and her brother was damn annoying
like
there was one time where #Aisyah#</P2 and him fought
and then like the middleman is me you know like he texts me like can you tell my sister to do this then I'm just like go and do yourself like what the fuck sia
I
no
so okay so over the years I thought #Aisyah#</P2 was just being like
a very like close best friend right and then like starting from this this moment when like she texted me in the morning she was like
um
no so when we were like sec four that was like what four years ago
then after that she texted like err her mum texted her apparently and and complained about to complain about her brother then after that her her mum was like he needs a
a strong women like #Ain#</P2 then I'm just like
yes
okay but like at at sixteen I wasn't having mental breakdown and I'm like actually scoring some grades you know so like ya
ya
ya sixteen year old me had it at all ya I peaked at sixteen sia ya like what is this I'm like twenty and ugly now
okay never mind lah whatever lah
then after that
um
ya #Aisyah#</P2 told me that then ever since then she was just like ee you my you my um sister-in-law now for like I think the next two years or whatever and then like
during that year she would she dated this guy who was like I think
six years older
yeah
like
no but like he was like quite questionable like
like
at the airport you know the one in like when you check in into the airport then like there are people sitting on that golf buggy no the golf buggy people
the one that drives the golf buggy
like in those uniforms like that's him then
and ya then after that like
um they had a lot of shit lah like
um how he how like she has to pay for like things whenever they go out this that this that then like
she okay she was like seventeen and he's like twenty three
I think ya then they
ya so
so anyway um they were having like a break I think like like she say like hey I'm gonna be busy cause she got promos what right then after that he say like oh okay l will like
whose like I think
like whose like also like I think around his age or like older and then
then after that he say something he told her err I'm sorry but um I already I I've I met someone new and uh she is already met my um
I don't understand then after that she was just like what the hell lah okay so like she was going through a lot right and then
ya then okay the the thing is right like you know how I attract like this kind of friends
you know how I attract this kind of friends like #Wati#</P2
ya then so um
um P2>#Aisyah#</P2></P2 slowly became like that lah like err very clingy then like everything also must like

mm
mmhmm
honestly yeah I can understand
what's your plan I mean like err I there was like I wanted to ask you about something like I had plans
the other day

to I mean like I had I wanted to do plans with you but then I forgot about it then after that I remembered
err like a few months ago and then like COVID happened and then I feel like it just took
way longer for me to like text you about it
it's okay
yeah
mmhmm
yeah like uh I also was supposed to travel a lot this year
then like
then like err I was supposed to like travel for a few countries and stuff but then like
I I just didn't have I mean because of COVID it didn't happen and also like
like
I was supposed to go I think like um
you know the good vibes fest at um genting
yeah I was supposed to go there and I mean and I mean it was like my first
mmhmm
yeah Ramly burger at the side of the road oh my god I miss that you know it's always like
eat at night
mmhmm
oh yeah like that's really sad it's like those like side
of the road thingy right I had
a maid like who like lives in like she we still keep in contact with her after like
you know after she left um indonesia
but
yeah I mean like my we sent her some money lah like me and my
mm
I have an uncle that lives there like I remember like um during
because for them it's like
so like they couldn't leave they just like stayed there
like it was like still not stable at all you know I mean it was like the same here lah we couldn't like leave anything
I mean we could not like leave the house or anything for them it's just like
they can't do anything I mean they from what I know it's like theirs more strict
but everybody still tries to get out
which is really bad you know what I heard though like there are people who
yeah
mm
like honestly indonesians are not fazed by the
by like any sort of ghost
hmm
but like okay lah I mean like it's still a big change in the life right
what do you mean you're not you don't you're not in school like I mean don't you have like
you don't need you no you don't need to go to campus is it
mm
how is the exam going to be conducted do you have to go to campus this time
mmhmm
mmhmm
hmm
like
in the classroom then it's like just like everybody has to social distance
oh
mmhmm
honestly I mean like
it's hard to be motivated at a time like this right then like most of my classes now since I'm like self studying and then like and stuff like that like it's not
physical so it's always just like online
so it's like like you said lah it's like same goes to you I guess it's like really hard to focus and then it's just like for me I work best with one to one
but like technically this is one to one but not like directly in front of me so it's like a bit
hard to focus but I think I'm okay it's like
since it's september eh september now right it's like
end of next month which is like like the exams is end of next month which is like super fast in my opinion
is I think is in England it's here
yeah so but like they did
make amendments lah for the topics I guess cause is like
for example like the sec four topics right like some of them are redacted
removed and stuff because it's like they we don't have the time to like
they didn't have the time to like properly like teach us stuff
then like I know my paper they are removing a big
big question from like
I think supposedly a topic that was supposed to be like taught this year
actually I can do I mean like I'm not very good with numbers in general but like
I could do math better than I do like I
back then like I was so bad at it but like I'm just giving myself a shot cause
it's like I'm just trying to work for my future at this point
but
yeah I mean like
even if with the topics being redacted and stuff like
I think the bell curve is going to be higher which kind of is going to suck so
mmhmm
yeah that's like my second time taking it so it like really sucks I mean like
I hope they understand the whole situation and also like maybe in future like
next year when they're like you know the intake for like tertiary education I hope there will be more lenient on it because it's like we
everybody is having a bad year this year I feel
but I mean
I understand what you feel lah like I also cannot like focus at home because like I have like four siblings and I have a naggy mother if I'm being honest
so it's like
you know I can never focus but then again like I'm better on my own
no matter the place like it doesn't have to be at home or anything
mm
only time will tell how we'll be like as marks you know in future
hopefully we're still friends by then
what were you doing yesterday
like
mm
mmhmm
yeah I mean like same I mean like I met
err rifky in the morning because like
and then I tried eating like that night itself I tried eating it again and it's still so much so like
rifky err I called rifky in the morning I said like hey do you want food
they were just doing their roundings ah but I didn't expect them to be like there that hour
but yeah I mean it was nothing
then after that like afterwards I just like stayed at home I didn't really do much
like
late at night lah
like it was so it's super nice it's like um
very innovative in my opinion
it's nice
mmhmm
I mean I've been there a few times and then like generally I feel like nothing there is
and yeah I mean like I recommend you to eat it but then it is a very big portion so that's one thing
and yeah I mean like I went to arab street like technically it was a sunday that I went there right
I kind of just don't really like going to these places in general in like
but it's okay lah I mean like I still like the atmosphere there lah it's just that it was like very hot and there were so many people so I got a bit like fussy
oh I ate with my family because it's like my it was my sister's birthday
then after that my sister like just requested that she wanted to eat there because like
ever since we tried there once like it became like our favorite place to eat
mmhmm
yeah that's what I feel also like
they from my experience right whenever like we go there like I think
um but yeah lah but I I think after COVID like they kind of cut down on it and stuff
but
ah you get it lah
you know ah there's this place I like to eat also it's called um indobowl
okay so like asides from indonesian food right they actually have this twist on like
ah Indomie then after that they have like for example like
side dishes and then they just infuse it together
it's a really nice concept honestly and it's really nice and the price is not so bad you know not as expensive as um
like um malayan council I mean like
a meal can go up to like eight to fifteen dollars for one it's not bad really
yeah basically then there's this ah I mean they have this platter thingy which I believe is
about forty dollars but it's meant to be shared but I tell you it's super nice and I don't know
I've always had good experiences with it I went there once and I kept going a few times it was just like not it's like the price point also not so bad you know
yeah actually same lah the other time when I was like you know because before COVID I had a job and then like
you know I could like treat myself to these kind of things like once a month at least
but now like ever since COVID I also have no money
and like
yeah so I've been trying to apply for jobs you know but I've been very access unsuccessful about it
what about you
the thing about that is they advertise it to make it sound really like attractive you know then okay to be fair like I tried to
uh applied for a lot also then like some a lot also never get back to me then some of them like
like is it worth like doing something like that I mean like as much as I'm desperate for a job also I'm just like is it still worth it
mm
they will say like oh we'll get back to you if we need you something like that in my opinion I feel like
because the waiting is very dreadful you know so I rather you just text me and say like I didn't get the job like
and like in the meantime at least I know
whether I should be applying for more jobs or I should like you know stop finding because like knowing I'll have the job or something
and yeah lah I mean like it's just
frustrating lah and then like you know these agents also sometimes they just
mmhmm
yeah I agree with that I mean like
I mean like I've worked a few jobs and stuff and then like you know so far I've been successful at getting it so like
this really hurts my heart that I've been so I've been rejected so many times
but and also like in a time like this you know like
everybody needs something but at the same time I understand why it's hard to hire people but at the same
time everybody's also broke so like
I don't know lah hopefully we'll get a job soon lah hopefully
actually ah I also under like over underestimated the fact that you know like COVID
just like outside people right and then after that there are people like singaporeans that got it then suddenly like
there was a spike and all that and it got mm like I was thinking to myself like okay this like whole ah
thing is not gonna die it's not going to
like go away any time soon
I like I also did a lot of online shopping I also did a lot like
Grab delivery and stuff because then I mean like Grab
I ordered Grab cause like
I was just so lazy to cook like it was so hard to be productive during circuit breaker
then all I did was just like
order food and order a lot of things online so I thought like maybe after circuit breaker I'll also get a job but
I didn't know it was still going to be hard
yeah
hmm
mm
mmhmm
then it's like they
like they prioritize so much about being like you know like
they prioritise so much about their free speech and then you know their rights as like you know doing this and that
but it's more of just like
you know you're like okay yeah you have your rights but at the same time like
look at the situation lah like you not using your mask and stuff like that like okay you want to die that's your problem but then don't
be hard on other people you know there are like people who are like you know auto immune you know which are more prone to the virus and stuff like that and
if it hits them it will be like ten times harder on them as well like you know average person
so yeah I mean
then like the other time also like I was watching the news
like cause like
err they were err the leading
doctor or scientist of
the whole like COVID situation in
um the right they were I think explaining to donald trump saying that
oh if you leave if you like you know stay out in the hot or the sun it will like you know
kill the bacteria of like the COVID faster
so like on surface you know like technically it can be passed through surfaces right but if it's a hot or if you sanitize it and stuff it will like die
like I don't know whether like how he read it or something but he was saying like
oh maybe uh we can look into like injecting ourselves with sanitizers with bleach and stuff like there were like you know
hoping to not get the uh virus then I'm like thinking to myself just like how are you
how is it possible that you even entered politics you know
like from what I heard right
like when he was making the speech
the doctor was just like staring at him like you know thinking like you know just like
why did I get myself into this into this
yeah
and then like it was really bad to the point that you know like mayors of different states
had to like
even tweet it out and say like you know
I can't believe I need to say this but please do not
drink detergent or like don't drink sanitizers or cleaning products
I don't know ah cause I feel like
the people like he's so I guess business forward
to the point that he was like more focused on
like the economy and stuff like
that I mean I get it lah like the economy is like important and stuff but then like
you can't have an economy if you don't have people right
so is like I think he was briefed and I watched this TikTok somewhere that he was briefed
about the whole COVID situation
um way like in like january like before he was
like before it like it it wouldn't really like stepped into
um the err the or like the just the western world in general
then like
he only took action like during may
you know then ah before that like I was watching like patriot act or something right then he was
there was this like whole like cause like the
it started spreading through like beef
industries and stuff like that because like
they didn't err they didn't let
the uh the workers like not
like you know social distance and stuff like that and then they were like
and then like
there's this like act I forgot like what
it's called but it's like
you
can mass produce stuff
in times of like crisis or war for example like when there's a war the act
then like the mm
president can uh enable this act so that you know they can mass produce like maybe like
metals and stuff like
war planes and stuff like that so I don't know why but it mass him
enabled that for the beef industry
and then like I don't know why he decided to do it for you know then he was saying like cause
um
most of the things are like you know like they are running out of food of something like that
something like that and plus like the cows
because of COVID like
they're all like
unattended because of the thingy but like the thing is like he put an act on that and not on like
for example like masks and like medical supplies because like
uh most medical supplies were from China and stuff and then they were like you know
there wasn't a shipment at that point of time but then in the have their own manufacturers but the thing is that
I don't know why it wasn't
acted on that and then for a moment there wasn't enough like
supplies for the medical team back in the
and then also like with the whole like drinking bleach thing like it's a common sense kan apparently common sense isn't not
who
I don't know dinosaur
oh okay that is so stupid
what's his name
yeah lah I mean like you put in effort also right so it's like then like
for them like to not
but yeah I mean like how's your time I mean like how how long have you been on OkCupid
yeah I mean I used to be on OkCupid also and then I received like the
funniest things I also I don't feel like I'm so picky also lah but then like yeah those like
yo and boring one like okay lah maybe I close one eye if you are good looking but like
you I don't know I mean like you want to like capture somebody's attention lah like
okay err there was ah
this person said
uh what did the okay cause like
um what did err what did the drummer name his daughters
yeah
so like you know my name is anna right so it's like
uh the answer is anna one anna two
anna one two three four
mm
hmm
yeah I mean like I I mean like I don't know how he
like got it maybe like it's a typical joke but then like it only works for people with the name anna I mean like how often do you know
of a girl named anna right
then also like I don't know that got me started talking
to him you know he was like really interesting and stuff but like I think it didn't really move on from there because like you know dating apps
you don't really move on that far
literally I was on all like I was on Tinder Bumble OkCupid because I was so bored during circuit breaker
oh okay so Bumble right
basically right for example like
okay as like
like for example if I uh if a guy like I swipe right to either like guys or girls
and for example like
if it's a guy the guy cannot text first
if you are the first one to swipe then like you haven't like
matched yet right then you don't have to start the conversation but if you are the one who swipes later and
you get the match right you have to be the one who starts a conversation and there's a time limit for you
like for example like there's
uh I mean err for you to text then the second you text
the person has twenty four hours to respond then from then there's just no timer
it's a very interesting concept actually
create a like you know an intro or like you know they are the ones that have like
start a conversation but this time it's like the
it's a reverse role so it forces you to want to text people
which is interesting lah but honestly I find like Bumble has like more good looking guys
I feel like not the typical like you know
I don't know cause like not a lot of people use Bumble compared to OkCupid and Tinder
yeah lah like
dah
dah dah like COVID eh so I don't know how many foreigners are still left in singapore
yeah I tried K Fry but okay honestly
maybe I had my expectations too high or something or maybe
I have like an like an idea of how it tastes in my head
it was a bit disappointing eh
but maybe I mean like maybe you'll enjoy maybe I'll enjoy it but maybe I just wouldn't put
like it's just not as nice as I thought it would be
but ah there's this thing called like a rice ball or something they mix it with like
sushi and like eh not sushi sorry um
like rice seaweed and like different stuff that one was nice but then like
would I go there for the chicken again I'm not sure
but like
the vibes is nice if I'm being honest and it's
okay lah for malaysia standard it's slightly pricey
mmhmm
hmm
no
you caught me at salted egg
I want to try the Din Tai Fung
um
and just like you know go shopping and stuff
so bad you know I want to see family enjoy the cheap food
then sometimes I like to like you know just make a little trip to like at night
and then like you know just
have fun lah you know cause like
I have friends now who
have motorcycles
I sneak out I just like take my passport and I just go but like
it's fun it's fun
yeah I love pepper lunch okay I accidentally tried it in singapore before cause like
yeah but didn't did like the last time I think the last time I went to didn't like we see each other by accident
it was like at or something right
mm
yeah it was so funny I remember I waved at you and then my family all just like turned around just like
oo who is that why do you have friends I'm like no
I mean it was fun uh I mean like err I think at the point of time I was at
a wedding near right but then like
we just didn't have the social battery to like you know like
just have like uh
to communicate with like our other uh relatives cause this is like a bit of like extended family it's like my dad's
but yeah cool lah then after Starbucks we like went to the Apple store
like then my uh my cousin bought like a macbook there which is like cheaper you know apparently
yeah then after that like just nice lah like he just bought everything there cause he was like starting school also
hmm
mmhmm
yeah I think I get you I mean okay honestly I'm not like the biggest fan of like
my family members you know I really miss it too
yeah no my aunt's um cousin
like from her other side then like we
err an indian muslim guy and the food was so good like
and yeah I kind of miss it like you know like it's also like free food right
I love it
ah
yeah yeah yeah for me it's like
I don't know
yes oh my god like
I mean it's it's stated in the name already you know it has to be there
okay but I remember some um the other time like I had an aunt
okay lah I mean like for mm for me for for you like you want to do anything like
very big family then like I always need to finish like my visiting and stuff like that
there's such thing
like your focuses are wrong seh but
you know people want to like you know
wedding would really spoil that I don't know how that works
mm
that's what I thought also like at first cause like
I think about it eh it's like
you know but at the end of the day like I mean like
have a reception afterwards then like have a bigger honeymoon right it's always better
mm
hmm
hmm
for me like
cause like I come my parents uh my grandparents are originally like from like malacca
I don't know for for me I guess a tradition
like the tradition I would want to omit out is just it being very big and with people I don't know
or like but at the end of the day it's just like I'm I mean like it's
to make it like stand out okay lah maybe I'm a bit narcissistic also I just want it to be like that wedding that people will never forget you know and I want ice cream
hmm
I'm just not a fan of that maybe at most like you know
see see at least got like err got aircond then you know
yeah I don't know I'm like everytime I go like weddings or something I'm always like in my head like
planning my own wedding like okay how is this going to pan out and stuff
oo ee
is it the one with eddie murphy
is it
mm
it's okay man like I've been thinking about my like future since I was like
since I was like you know really young too like eleven you know like I have a name from my
yeah I mean I have err I have names for like maybe my future children then like uh um
my first child I plan it to I plan for it to be like luna malika
I haven't thought of like a guy's name but pretty sure I like the name maliki
and I don't know I like the name like
ayla like A Y L A you know because I feel like
ah it's such a nice name you know it's like a unique but like not so hard to pronounce name
I feel especially with the fact that you know you you're just at home alone and then you don't really think much
it happens you know like for me is like I already picture what kind of house I want to have and stuff like where I want it to be located and stuff
like you know like in a singaporean like you know setting lah obviously like
but as much as I want to have like a
five storey bungalow something like
I'm pretty sure it's possible here but also like I I need to hustle way too much I mean way too hard to get there
mmhmm
sometimes I think about it also like
isn't it like for me like I think if it's like better for me to just my migrate because it's like
you know having everything but then I think again like all my family is here
then after with the whole COVID situation like so many like governments just like you know all the problems just came up
as much as I feel like it's a bad thing that but it's so ah it's also like a good thing that I feel like you know like the problems are being addressed but yeah mean like
for now at least I feel like
mm I'll just stay here
for the time being if not then
I'm oh I mean I'll just pack up and leave
yeah I mean um
I mean I don't understand ah for me is like I've always wanted to go overseas also and study but like
and
like you know it's just very competitive like in within the asian culture
go europe or something you know with like a whole different language like I want to learn a new language and stuff but then I thought about it lah like
cause I did early childhood before and then like
to be in the environment with like your culture and stuff will like
it's better lah cause like the child will grow up like you know understanding it better so like for me if I'm like let's just say I move to europe
my it's going to be hard for my child to learn like
basically like three languages like for example like if I don't speak the language
like of that european country let's just say it's Spain right then like my child have to learn to like
learn malay learn it's like english and also like
spanish and also like learn the culture there then they won't have like any ties to like
singapore cause like you know they never grew up in singapore which is like a bit sad lah cause it's like you know it is my culture and then I want to bring it down also so
I guess like
staying in singapore is always like the best option and plus like you know being a singaporeans there's always like benefits
with like the whole like healthcare and stuff like you know
like housing healthcare
as much as it's expensive it's still like beneficial
mmhmm
yeah oh my same lah cause like I my my mum's malay is like super good like apparently she got like A one or something back in
secondary school and then she became a malay teacher once and then she was saying ah like
oh my god like none of my children can speak malay and she was like especially you you know
and then like my mum was saying lah like
um ah my mum was saying saying like ah like
in future she wants to take care of my children and for the main purpose is because
for sure cannot help them with their malay
mmhmm
mm
oh
would not be able to do as well
because it's like
I'm not very good at it but it's like you know I like the whole
idea that we still do it then like it kind of just like it surprised me that a lot of my friends like don't
like you know they don't know how to do it
and then like sometimes also like sometimes they tell me like you know they don't even celebrate like the first day or like they don't celebrate at all then I'm like
even though like growing up like you know
the fact that I know that there are malay people in this day and age like who don't do it just makes me so sad

eh
um okay I was suppose to start my day at ten but it's already twelve
so that happen
so that every okay okay it's recess week you meant to take breaks right ya that's
ya that's true but at I have an assignment due tomorrow
yes yes
yes we take the same thing
ya
oh
cause I woke up at eight thirty then I just like took my time
and then like I eat at home
just told me that she is coming is coming late so I was like okay lah
she said that she was thinking of tumpanging with
his her parents cause the parents sending the brother to school
no just some eh primary school I think ya
then in the end she said she couldn't wake up I mean that thing happens to a lot of us sia
ya
no she stays in choa chu kang
ya
mm mm
busy uh ya so that they can now set a target put in your schedule as well
according to her they are not going to do a department photoshoot more of like individual photoshoot
cause like I don't know I think it was hard also for them to come out with department photoshoot
no idea what they are going to do I guess we shall
um see how is it going to be like
she is the ya she is the head
ya she is head she is head
acap
ya
ad hoc ad hoc me
I am so happy honestly
I'm I'm loving my life
next sem no they said that this sem I feel won't have volunteers
ya it's more of online stuff
haven't right
members ya
haven't open yet
oh
don't know whether that's slow or not but it's not my problem also
yes that is true
a'ah
all the best to them I remember during my time we did both at the same time
like finding the heats and opening up the recruitment
those were the days
good thing I'm not FOMOing I think if I miss it I will FOMO and will join so
no I don't think I want to join I don't think so
are you planning to join
ya
that's true ya you don't need to like try some more
ya
yes last year best year there's right so I'm doing other shapes yes instead of doing school stuff
yes
yes what is the other things that we should be doing
oh my god I always wanted to see
ha okay K K
ya
ya
oh okay lah and
oh
cause other dating apps you need to upload a legit photo of yourself right to make sure that
ah I've been wanting to see how it works
oh is that
oh
ha
you cannot like delete the profile ah
serious then what did the guy do
the thing right then they will read it was the limit of ten guys I think oh
oh
okay okay
ya that's why it's like a bit too intense for me lah
Muzmatch
uh
mm
oh
cool through half of our deen
ya
ya
oh
oh
oh my god that's nice okay set I will go for half of our deen instead of Muzmatch
ya international love that's the way to go
but half of our deen also for muslim
oh
serious
Muzmatch no need to pay
oh
interesting
where were where is it from I heard it's from some dating apps also was it I'm not sure
so that they will match you to the right person like
I don't know what is it
do you pray oh okay
ya
oh
okay okay that's cool
interesting
but do you think you will bond to meet your significant other through a dating apps
I think
oh
ya
that's true
I know right
I like to observe the people first from afar
then see how is he like then I did like something that
um people other people opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instant if people around him keep saying that oh my god he is such a nice person and he does this this this then I will
be like oh okay since like he is kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya or else
ya that's true
oh
ya
that is so sad
ya
hmm
that is sad
oh well sometimes it works for people sometimes it does not
about putting themselves out there you know some people were saying that in unique
a lot of people also try their best to put themselves out there and you can see there's some people will be turned off by that right
ah that is true that is true
ya
ya ya it does
clap for me
ya ya that is scary
ya
I don't know whether it is still like that is it still like that
or maybe I just turn a blind eye on it it just like
but I think someone ask me this before
an outdoor person may I like to do outdoors things like
ya I feel like I told you this before no
I'm a outdoor person like I like to do outdoor things like
then probably an ideal date for me will be doing things somethings outdoor lah somethings like trekking oh my god I love trekking just like walking around because right
when I trek with my friends I we have we actually don't have a lot of things to do other than walking
and also like since it is quite silent sometimes you want to listen to the silence around you
and if you are trekking with your friends you will be comfortable with the silent so maybe you want to see whether there's ya comfortable with the silent with that guy
and also like um sometimes you also want to talk because trekking will be pretty long
so wouldn't want to stay quiet all the time so for instance if I want to go on a movie date
then I can't really talk to him I can't really get to know him right so if I was talk walking I can like
try to get to know him and like see how is he like
ha
tricky question don't know eh I feel like first date
and like subsequent dates I would want to go trekking
ya not bad not bad is that like too much
I have never dated people before so I wouldn't know what is too much
ya I feel that movie date is too much
because it's so intimate
ya and it's dark and it's scary like
what are you going to do
you never know
ya
ya exactly
but that's like another two hours it's too long
I don't know
I don't know how long
ya
do you also want to go trekking
then what is your first date
oh ya that's the point though if you can't accept me at my lowest there's no reason being
oh okay okay sure
few months okay
oh ya then the first one eh
oh my god that's sound fun actually I always wanted to go picnic
with someone like a significant other like I don't know
ah
kan like these few days people have been picnicking a lot
ya
lay flat lay is it ya flat lay
wah
that is so cute
ya I would want to end my date with sunset
so I am going to go home first but mostly that won't happen lah
ya
halfway halfway
like
they just went toilet
oh that is super rude though
ya
does that happen often though like you people just ghost
ya
ya
ya I pretty sure it's not
I'm on like a dating app you pretend to be someone else
mm
oh okay okay
ya
oh
maybe cause like he's still very young also so like I think eighteen nineteen it's pretty young so he doesn't really know what to do maybe I forgive him for doing that
because
ya like the first thing you already lie like you haven't even start anything you already lie that is so sad
oh okay
uh huh
ya
oh okay that's so fast but that's so cute too lah
interesting
oh
ya it sounds like an interesting concept
oh
ya
and everything because you only need the birth cert so at that point it was really a matter of
ah
oh
that's good I don't know
I don't know would you
no I don't think so
ya ya
it is important
I don't know lah you know the malay store malaysian drama or malaysian movies
ya isn't that like kind of the same thing also
mm
I used to think that I'm okay with my parents match making me but then now
nah I don't think so
oh I don't know I change
ya if I don't get married then it's fine lah
twenty five is quite early ya cause like in three years
ya oh my god
twenty five sounds like a good age
then now you're twenty two you haven't really get your shit together then like
three years to get your shit that's really too fast
ya I think like twenty five sounds okay if you already have a
ya
a'ah a'ah my friends also
at first I was like ah I want to move out I want to buy a house
at first I was like ah but I I want to move out I want to buy a house but I can't really apply for right you know
ya
is it cause of the current resource
maybe they should like create an environment that is healthy for the future generation to live in then maybe we will consider to procreate
I mean if like the view if we can see the future being so messed up and everything right now are so messed up and like the systems a'ah and all that
if you want to have children would you want our future generation to suffer
ya and that's the thing
obstacles challenges you will go stronger lah and all those bullshits I was like that is such a sad life
kan
I mean like in other countries you will still be a minority too
multiculturalism whatever it is
I don't even know what that is
uh huh
ya but she's like oh okay
ya ya ya
you just one way
ya have you watched enola
neither have I I thought my sister and my parents watch it last night
girl this lady asking sherlock I think asking sherlock
do you saw it then I was like oh my god ya
ya ya ya
fits you perfectly
I was like bro damn that is like I don't need
mm okay ya
ya
ya that's true that's true
nah nah
then like mm okay
that's weird
it's so jarring to us maybe but
which suits them perfectly
it's so sad
does he saying that it does not exist oh my god
ya
that's quite sad
then we should step up more so that there will be more representation
otherwise they wouldn't hear right really meh
even if I step up will they hear
do they want to listen in the first place
where is the empathy right
people's action
hais
ya like other countries aren't any better either
right right that's the thing right
then like okay fine I am very grateful for that but like
why like why are you comparing our country with other countries who are even not even on par with us like we are
I don't think we should just compare countries across countries like that
ya ya that's the thing
ya
like even if they allow us to wear is like there is still this line
which is sad like sure like he just like I told you to wear what
then like you still treat me so differently just because I wear a hijab
ya like what you think I don't deserve those rights only some people deserve the rights
oh my god why is everything so funny
ya
kan that is the sad part like in retrospect I feel so
sad that why was I like that it was so gross and disgusting
hais
it's okay to be void of
ya sad life
sad life

so like are you working from home now or what
mm
like
really be in office right
don't mention it man it's been damn crazy
you know right I I've been doing online right I've been on doing online learning so it's been
very tiring lah
because for me it's like online learning is
like the workload is increasing
so it's not like people say it's like alah online jer pe
ya
sitting in front of the laptop I don't think I don't think that's my ideal staying at home situation
like
I I feel like I've dreamt about this before but okay nevermind ya
so ya lah but now um it's it's going to be exam period soon and assignment period and stuff like that so
I'm just
trying to survive day by day but
ah ya lah ya lah I mean
I'm trying
ya true
I've been stress eating and I haven't been exercising that much
like
buying comfort food
and my comfort food is like not those healthy one please is like those what chocolate
mm liho
kan
eh but I've been doing this err one cardio tau
err this one channel
it's like this one guy instructor and one female instructor
they are couples like
I think husband and wife
so
then um
video
oh no I think
songs you know music so
to me
quite quite quite quite fun also
ah ah
because for me like
be consistent ah
I know I have to take care of my health but I don't really bother about this kind of thing until like you until like someone really fall sick or it's like a wake up call
ah ya
the pimple and stuff like that and then like you know
um
okay lah maybe I'm just lazy
ya
so it's not online learning it's just me
ya
or is it because you like this kind of
vibe
you know what
you should put like fairy lights man
the orangey type or the white one
you you still use it lah
oh
we met in err
primary school ah
wait
wait
so if we met serious primary three
oh my
so that means we'd be friends for like about twenty plus years
oh my
eh but actually kan
but actually
our friendship is like random
kan because I remember in secondary school we we weren't really contacting each other kan
close
yes then
wow you know I'm an introvert kan then
to to click with someone because she's an extrovert
and then like
ya
oh my god
I don't know what you are thinking but no that's not what I meant okay you and your you and your weird mind
alright whatever
okay lah okay lah let's not go that direction
oh about my boyfriend eh
okay lah okay ah I think
mm
I I don't remember I don't I don't recall if I told you about his condition cause
okay the okay err what was the last time that I told you about him eh do you remember
popping in his mouth so it was very painful for him
err eventually it didn't get better for him and he was very worried and then the fact that because kan he um because he's staying far away from family so his anxiety level is really really very high and
I was trying his best to be very supportive but at the same time I was also very tired because he wasn't trying to be positive as well
I mean I understand where where he's coming from but
to me if you're not trying to be positive about your condition
it's very difficult
kan so like um
his condition kind of worsen tau
from the throat to
technically like the whole part of him lah got worse
he
something wrong err there's something wrong with his kidney
so
for the for the for the appointment
ya but then
like he
he really drains me
not only mentally
throughout this whole um
so like
cause it's always been about his sickness
so like
mm ya
ya because
like
mm okay
okay actually kan that time he asked me tau
okay
okay this is very cliche but
like
like like like you said relationship
but
okay maybe it's also my fault for not healing properly
when I got to know this new guy
but
I don't know eh because you know my soft spot for my ex kan
and I hate the fact that he made me feel this way
you know sometimes I feel like
because just now I was talking to err my friend
that guy
ah like okay cause he was my best friend
so
you can be with
you can be yourself
you want to be with your best friend you know like you can talk about anything and he was that kind of person but because of my
my my temper my my my my mood
I shouldn't screwed up I shouldn't have screwed up my relationship with him
kan
actually kan to think of it I think he was like my only best friend tau
I mean you know during poly I had a lot I had a lot of guy friends
but I think he was like my only best friend
and
ya to lose him was like a double double hit seh double blow ah in a way because you lose your
best friend and you lose your boyfriend
ya
but
um like you said I think at that point of time we were young
okay and you know at at that point of time I had a very terrible okay maybe this is an excuse
but I had a terrible time with my family remember my parents were divorcing at that point of time right I had it tough then
I was very temperamental emotional okay lah I was a shitty person
then
ah
we bump into each other and then
keep like letters
pictures
for him it was very thoughtful because
I mean it's not expensive you just like what print out a template and you write but to him he was very it was a very thoughtful gift
so I'm a sucker for that kind of thing I'm a sucker for like letters and stuff like that so
like recently I was looking through my memory box and then I saw
at the wedding
he was looking at me
I basically I tried to flirt with him tau
no
I think he kind of
learn his lesson so he tried not to engage
it's he was my best friend yes but we we both now lead a different life
and he has his group of friends I have a group of friends
and I don't know whether I can fit into his life anymore
I mean people change right
err it was a not okay now it's funny but that point of time it wasn't
oh wait no or was it a date
after that
we'll we'll both very angry with each other then we didn't talk to each other
I think so lah I think I can't remember where but
it was at a a station
ya
ya no
no no I mean like as in
then
asked a feedback
from him about me
I asked him I said
err what do you think of me when I was your girlfriend back then
said um
because that's me as a person that's my personality
but
ya so in a way after that whole conversation I apologise again lah
so it was all cool
at that point of time yes
but
I remembered my two relationship will my two exes
ya then kind of got me um
traumatised
seriously
he's just so
ya
there's a lot of things that I really want to change like
serious seh I shouldn't have been
playing that kind of game back then
do you think it's a crazy idea if ever
one day
I asked him out for a catch up session
a'ah seh recently I've been dreaming about him that's why I asked you this question
then um
ya
maybe
maybe his birthday is in january tau
ya
do you have any plans
ya
okay
kan kan
true
with someone shitty like me just kidding
okay
ya
ya lah ya lah
you can like do many many recordings for them
ya but
ya but I think for now
ya man tell me about it
next ah next
well I can write like a whole twelve series about you
you and your you and your don't don't get me started on your
your nonsense

ya at this rate honestly I'm just grateful if we can travel to malaysia even johor bahru will be good enough
for me since um as you know right I have a house in and it's been
eight months I think
since I last went back and
um when back and you know met my see my cats and just do weekend grocery shopping
ya so it's
when uh when was last time you travelled
they are locals they are local students
all all these
all these you're talking about your trip ah in korea to korea
mmhmm
mm
okay for me I went to korea as well the last time
it was
last
mm
no
so I was there uh I went with my friend on a night
um
so
we had a actually quite
the flight experience was
okay for me this one my first night flight
but
cause
this time round was with Korean Air
so I didn't really I didn't really enjoy my flight lah
ah
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm mm
okay we didn't want to spend too much lah on
flight
cause when we were when we're going to be in korea for eleven days
so
it's more of like what we gonna spend over there
not so much of the flight
so
so what did I
hotel
Airbnb
ya
okay
I tell you my journey lah kan
so we were very happy that it's convenient
very excited
not to the lobby lah
so we we put uh we key in the pin code and then we saw flight of stairs
are you kidding me I'm not uh I
I'm I don't I don't want what
what what I I don't want to
bring my luggage up lah you know
it was it was like err
but we had no choice we had to do lah
key in key
the first thing we saw was a puppy it was a dead uh it was it was a puppy it was a toy
and send and send to the owner
it was a doll
mm
you get what I mean or not
dhira do you know what I mean or not
ya
so it's actually a toy it's actually a
what do you call that
uh not not really not not statue lah it's like
what ah um
no no no no no
ya it's more of a decoration piece just to add in to the apartment
ya
so we actually okay
so what we did was we actually booked one night
so instead of booking ten nights we actually booked eleven nights
just so that we don't have to wait until the
the check in time at three
so that's what we did lah
how how ya
mm
mm mm
mm
check in
mm
mm
ya so
we in order for us to move in
we had to book one night at the okay one night before so that
the nobody can book and then we can have that room like so technically it's like
we check in late lah right
we check in late but we just paid we paid the extra
one twelve forty dollars
cause it's forty dollars per forty five dollars per night
mm
I stayed at dongdaemun
ya
mm
for me um
during my time eleven days there lah right uh what
makes it um okay cause I went there for trip so it was just me and my friend
just the two of us
err initially we wanted to go
to the other part of korea like daegu and busan
but we decided to um decided not to lah
so we just stayed for
mm we didn't okay wait we didn't really okay now I'm with I'm trying to recall I think out of the eleven days only the first seven days we actually did quite a lot of things the other four days is just like lazing around lazing around uh and
more like own time own target
when we feel like going out we go out if not then we just
eat Maggi in the in the room
cause we just want to get the korea air
mm
planetarium
mm so it wasn't a skiing period lah
it was like spring I think
ya it's spring
ya it's spring
the only thing that okay
it was crowded
so our main objective um
was to go around to all the hot spots
to take photos um
and just chill
like their people that like their locals
so we went to so we went to hongdae myeong-dong all those typical place lah
mm
no that was my graduation trip so before before before I went korea okay okay I okay to be honest right last last year
last year was
um the best I think was the best like
one of the best year of my life like one of the best year
march I was in I went to japan for a family trip with my uh for family trip so I only came back for one week
before I travelled to korea with my friend for for trip
so I actually went so actually went to japan and korea
uh one for family trip and then one for
err
one for um trip with my friend
um
mmhmm
okay for me um cause I just started cause I just started the good thing is that um
I went to okay I
how do I say this
okay I enrolled in I enrol in together with my friend who I went for trip to korea last year
so technically we will graduate we will graduate at the same time
at the same time
so ya maybe if
so maybe if we have we do not we don't have more we don't have
much commitment uh I wouldn't mind planning for a trip with her
but honestly I feel like going to switzerland
but it's so expensive lah aiyo
for me it's actually the scenery
not much so much of
cause when I travel I don't I don't like to shop actually
ya
okay and to be honest I don't mind going back to korea even though okay I've been to korea
the experience uh were all different so I went
the third time was with my friend so these three actually gave me a different these three actually gave me a different experience but out of these three actually the last experience
very bad like very very bad experience okay the thing is right maybe cause
my friend and I
we look like koreans
so we were like treated like locals like people were like rude to us
ya
um
travel to krabi in june
so we supposed to travel in june cause
I was supposed okay I was supposed not I was supposed lah
like freedom to travel so we planned for like a five
five five days four nights to krabi so we had all like we create a WhatsApp group of all the cousins going blah blah blah blah blah
and then got cancelled
cause of COVID
so
even though I entitled for eighteen days leave I end up using my leave
for exams
uh yes
uh for the first time it's actually unlimited
is still part of singapore
is it part of singapore so you need to take ferry lah aiyo need to take a ferry that that's what makes it different lah but let
oh okay speaking of pulau ubin uh recently actually okay we had we had uh group uh like
all the cousins right
we have group with all the cousins right
it's a legit group
I didn't enrol in that camp but sister did lah
my my sister did
so but none of my cousins okay the cousins that were supposed to go krabi all of us have never been to pulau ubin so we wanted to go to pulau ubin
like last
like
last month
so we cancelled that
so to be honest the group the WhatsApp group name keep changing
no
I'm sleeping I'm sleeping alone
shut up
loyang still exist ah
I can't remember the last time I actually went to chalet
civil defence or civil servant
orh
mm
okay no wait now you're talking about horror story
okay ah just nice before COVID the same group of cousins who actually planned for krabi
okay okay how this group started kan
it's was cause we we
we planned for all
okay I have a very big family so the girls that are not married
female like the close one that are not married yet
uh five of us
okay so
uh five of us lah
so in
so there were five of us
my sister me my three of my cousins lah so we planned and then we stayed in a hotel a quite famous hotel
so we okay so they were insist they insisted
to
take bus
I don't want to take bus
I I hate long bus ride
I prefer honestly I prefer like uh
bus
more expensive one type more expensive ones so it was quite comfortable ya so it was quite comfortable
so that's not the point the point was
we reached the hotel at five
five and all of us are like half awake
so reached the hotel lobby and then we checked in as usual cause we did ask we did request for early check in cause one thing about our there's one thing about me and my family we don't like to waste time
we don't like to wait we we just would rather just pay extra to just like check in early whatever lah
so reached the hotel the hotel lobby
um
uh one one one one of the one of the famous hotel in that has a shopping mall
so
cause there were five of us so we take the suite
the okay that that was not the first time uh I stayed there
it was the second time actually the first time was with my family lah
so it's technically a a door like
door within a door you get what I mean
okay on the okay so on the next next okay the door next to our room
is the emergency exit
so when you walk a little bit more uh it's the kitchen the big living room with the dining
with dining
inside that living room next to the dining is another room with a king-sized bed that that that that's my cousin's room
so we have two toilets lah
okay the thing is that right when you when we went in uh cause we were all very sleepy already
so we just take our spot we didn't even bother to like
err
give any comments we only shared our experiences when we reached singapore and it's not like the next day after one week and we actually heard it from
our mothers like like I told my mum
ah they told their they told their my aunt
so actually my mum and my aunt shared our stories then we we went back to the WhatsApp group and like
oh my god you experience you experience this
I experience this also
then after that we meet and then we shared the story like it's funny that
all of us experienced different things but we only decided to share that thing when we in singapore
okay so
my there there were five of us so
uh my sister and I took the first room
so my cousin insisted that she wants an extra bed
so we so we called and all these we we called and then they said that uh oh um the bed is hundred fifty per night and all this lah
ya but
so so we were like okay lah we didn't think much then like just heard the biggest the bigger sister took the sofa and then we all just went to bed and then at twelve and then at twelve and then at twelve when we wanted to go for lunch
then my cousin brought it up again I want to get an extra bed
so everybody sleep in the room together
ya the same cousin that okay one of the younger one lah
so she she insisted she wanted to get extra bed
so we were like why why is she so persistent then my my sister my sister my sister offered
uh no okay wait no babe the story has not ended
so uh when my sister offered
she she was still very persistent my cousin was still very persistent no no no no everybody sleep in the room
so
at night we all went back
and then we we all went back and then
we all went back to our hotel room and then suddenly we just
together
so we actually brought the entire uh we moved the entire bed uh all the mattress outside at living room imagine how big the living room is
so we moved everything out at the living room and then we just slept together for three nights
okay let's just sleep together
okay
so
we thought of like uh let let's go get bath bombs
uh
ya in the bath bombs
but
it was a mistake
no
um
after that is the bathtub
um the toilet bowl
and then there's a glass door inside for the shower
so so the bath so so is the bathtub so the shower is actually facing the glass door the the glass door is actually facing the bathtub
so can you imagine when we were when
I was alone in the toilet they were all outside
ya but then none of us lasted more than ten minutes
cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too lah so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money lah I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty
thirty bath bombs so
uh that okay that was the second night when we decided to um buy the bath bombs and
so we all slept outside okay so fast-forward
when we went home
that night okay when we went back to singapore
I told my mum and uh my grandma
yes
and it's a high floor what what do you think
right
ah
but
we didn't think much lah cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right
I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me um what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something lah
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes
um
so they also say so when we came together or during the family gathering then then we bring it up and say um
ya
when my mum called her sister then
mmhmm
they all so they were like tell tell telling so
then I'm like is it so we so so we so in the WhatsApp group we
so we in the WhatsApp group we said
you all got stories
and then they said ya I got ya ya we got
okay
uh another bed
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes
yes
yes
cause she actually had a history of like
um this this kind of thing ah ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
um she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually uh on the left
um
was the bed
was the mattress
I find it I'm trying to recall
okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
um dusty
nothing else um was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty
so we all see different things but overall the room was dusty
so overall one the room was dusty lah
okay technically we were like the late guests
so
I
think uh occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor
and okay the highest floor right okay the the the fact that the we got a high floor
we already at that point
we were like
um in our heart lah we're like
uh this is the
first this is the first time we are getting a high floor room
ya but then we didn't think cause uh it was like five thirty in the morning who cares whether the room is who who cares the the room is high or low we just want our bed ah
so when we so so after that
so okay the continuation of the story
that was our personal experience and then
and then when and then when my cousins uh she we all we all went back to work
and some right
so my cousins ah
so my cousin said uh
best lah
uh it was fun
but we had uh
we had experiences
uh in the hotel room
she is a malaysian
oh
yes
so they did that um
so so the moment she know what that she uh quickly met WhatsApp in the group so we also Google lah
luckily it came out was in twenty fourteen and we were like
I went there last I went there
this year february just nice before the lockdown
no and technically okay
and okay this was
uh
the first time
was with my family
but that one we actually uh my parents took the first room and then the four five of us right the the living room
technically it's not okay technically there were no living room ah during our time the suite the suite was different so there were no living room it's just uh king bed a platform a sofa bed a sofa so all of us
four five of us slept there then my parents at the uh
front room lah
so it was a different room but
maybe plus minus same size
so it were was that that was last two years with my family was last two years
this year january was with my cousins
oh only sixteen twenty
that uh definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like
thirty
but it's a very famous hotel seh
corner corner
okay the the floor
so the the the hotel very big right
uh the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
uh
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like um kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
uh we couldn't be bothered lah cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
uh
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work ah we we we like err don't want ah we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in and we could have been to krabi if not cause of this COVID
ah it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us uh
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were uh
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think lah
eh ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal one
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
err given a choice I won't want to go back there
ah
but I've
but I'm okay honestly I will I glad that I experience it with my cousins
cause if I'm if I'm cannot experience it with my family my my mum who knows my mum will end up reading one one whole book of like
ah recite recital and
the laundry room
no while waiting for laundry
ya I remember that story

oh because it's much easier ah
mm
so so you it really depends uh ah
ah
mm
oh
mm
a'ah
which one is this eh
mineral water jer eh

I won't be able to sleep I need to eat
ah
really
the long
historical korean dramas whatever this one long
yes
only if I if my eyes loop
I only realise it when I saw when I met haziq yesterday I don't know if he saw my Tik Tok or not but I was like no one saw his face and ah now I know now I know what is dark humour

later on later on I think so after that fight with the eight tails then they will be like a
um all the five nations no all the five nations will meet together
to discuss on the upcoming war
and then after that a subsikey will just appear and then say I will I will declare war on everybody here
ya all because
his battle naruto

cannot oh my god I just realised I spent
oh the the filler episode I will always skip one
the you always can check um
is it easy
page right just search for naruto then search for the synopsis part and then you see you scroll down the moment you see the words filler right
then you just skip ah you will know which
the owner like get surgery on this its actually because
one of the ways to make it look nicer is I have to go for the surgery lah ya basically like cut a piece of the skin off and then stitch it together and make it like but someone do that but just double surgery on both
make it look like right
serious ah

if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be

with roti or nasi like
if I want to eat rendang I rather choose
then
it's like fantastic lah

mmhmm
okay lah okay lah I kind I kind of understand lah
okay
you ask me what question you want to ask
you you
okay
I think I think right I think
and then
we don't need to worry about
you know
so if you don't have to work
so if
we we don't need to get the money to pay our bills then
I think
we will just
then maybe the whole world won't be so capitalistic
yeah
consumerism consumerism
yeah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
like if you drop
everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
risk
that is so true though
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think for me
um I only risk
failures lor
oh I risk time
side is time because I feel like
because I'm really so old you know like twenty four
and you need to like
like
you know you have to get your dreams in order basically lah
so macam like
like ugh
it's so sad right
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
not everybody is that lucky I guess
mmhmm hard work is also another thing
mmhmm
like do you think you would actually have the strength to like not give up anymore
you try hairstyling also
and then you find out that like eh you found nothing like everything in the world you try and that like
mmhmm
true lah
at the same time also you feel like like
err there's also there's always new things to discover I guess
explore and try
mm
mmhmm
if you had three wishes
what would you wish for

I will I will ask for a never ending fortune

mmhmm
mmhmm
my second wish
um
probably that
we may be looked as equals
yeah basically
tradition you know tradition sucks man
they suck balls
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
like ask ask my friend was like saying that like oh ah
like he's the only child so
you know
hmm
mmhmm
yeah
just the
just how society
look at us
basically ah
like their requirement to like oh for women to be considered
to be married off
and then they don't put the same on guys
but
like girly you know you have to like
be
motherly figure
cannot cry cannot be emotional
you have to be strong
uh huh
society is definitely the problem
ok then your second wish
meaning
mmhmm
mm
basically you just don't want to regret
like you just want to like be confident of your choices no matter what you take no matter what you what no matter what you did
is it
uh huh
mmhmm
uh huh
but I think for me leh uh
so far no matter even if I had bad choices right I feel like I am generally pretty satisfied with whatever I choose lah
like
I mean ok like it when it comes to
my exes then that is another different story lah
is a is a lesson to learn
but at the same time if I didn't go through that I feel like
I wouldn't be this kind like I wouldn't be myself I wouldn't be the person that I am today
so to me I don't feel
an ounce of regret
in any of my decision so far
because like that okay I think my third wish I would
ah
wish for
the skills of
every cook in the world
I also didn't know like it was one of my choices lah for me to to
uh one

this is called independent learning never heard of that before ah
I mean when you're going to go to work also they also just throw you some
work for you to do what they won't even explain to you

woohoo
let's go hello
mmhmm
okay but one question are you gonna answer it too
no
okay let's go
mmhmm
oo
I think that's a question where did you get them from
just random ya um I think if I were to follow my dreams what am I risking I think I will risk family time
family time is
crucial right
a bit of both
he's just a guy that always ask us to do what we wanna do
how do I do
oo
ya
that's a good superpower
oo
saves time
ya
wow
I've never thought of that
unusual
oo
then I think
uh first few pictures would be my grandparents and then my parents nothing much cause I don't
think there will be a lot of things in the time capsule
ten years ago oo
right
wow
wow ya that's a tough
like a period of time you know everybody has a tough period during secondary school especially sec one cause like dude
we did not alter our skirts did you remember we talk about this we did not alter
skirts we we don't know
ya
mmhmm
ya
I think that is peer pressure
kan
I think if I don't have like much friends last time
yes
cause you have like certain clans I don't know whether it it it happens in your school
since we're talking about school but like my school has a lot of clans
like the pretty one one side and then the people are one side so
I don't belong in any groups so that's a hard part sometimes I don't even eat just sit down in class just just
oo
oh you call it monitor in your school
class chair
mmhmm
mmhmm
they have different ya
mmhmm
I was that girl
I was that girl
no I oh ya I forgot we had the I forgot we had the blazer on
ya but for my school we call it um have to
we don't just have prefect we have like a two uh different roles
so there's like a student council and student leader
student leader is student leader you just do like basic um just make sure all the class are good and everything but student council which I was in we do a lot with discipline master
ya so for student um leader
if I'm not wrong we only had they only had um the badge but for mine I have the badge I have the tie the blazer
so ya coming from
and we are good with uh literature so we really have to do good in both
ya
so ya
mmhmm
of course
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
like a stable right
ya
ya and that's why secondary school was the toughest
primary school was okay I would say
but secondary school like the pressure is on everything have to do good or else you have to repeat um sec four
except for school show cause like for our
time we had to go sec five
had to
ya had to but then
ya
mm
in school
oo
yes
something else
wow
the best
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
yes I think that's my most memorable one
that's my answer
chicken wrap
ya bubble tea then they had to close and then they changed to like a random mini cafe with like that was after I graduate so
ya but that's for me but for you
the two dollars
ya
kan
I just remembered it's behind the drink stall
oo ya
ya
fragrant
oo
ya
the ramen the japanese ramen that's my number one
ah that's good ramen there's the
end stall that's why
but ya
that's the best one so two top two is
two dollar chicken wrap and also kimchi ramen
the beef
ramen
ya
ya
anything that is not generic to you you're like no I know you
I mean
as long as halal
okay
so for the bad podcast
oo
we're sticking to that oh my god ya
ya
sensitive
ya
perspectives
mmhmm
well we're talking about bullies remember just now we're talking about
um bullies in secondary school
well I was labelled as a boy
ya
okay cause
was number one for me
I did all the that are good sports to I have multiple
usually do sports and music I was in band and then I moved to volleyball netball softball
that's primary school itself
it's all that's
so that's that ya
oo don't get me started on secondary school but was much lower but like for
secondary school I did let me run through
ah
secondary school I my number one yes my number one all time is
um which if nobody knows what it means national police cadet corps
uh and then I also did aside for
volleyball netball floorball same what like primary school and then I also did tchoukball
tchoukball it's a I don't know whether a lot of people heard or not yes
tchoukball
bounce back to you you're supposed to not catch it it's the opponent who supposed to catch it to save the points
a side of rugby during did everything
ya but like labels itself ya I was labelled as a boy
my voice
ya
the the topic is about bullies
but like ya bullies uh I remember one time
cause it's hard
I think I was in like secondary two or sec one
like early secondary school days
and then she just looked at me and I remember her face I remember her name until now
I'm just saying
but I remember her name until now I remember her face I saw her before actually okay but we're not gonna talk about that
but like um she like looked at me she's younger by the way
she's like I think it was sec three or something like that ya she's a junior
she just came then she looked me she was like
um
just wanna ask are you a boy before this
so for me at that point you know at that age we're like huh what did I do wrong
and she starts yes
so I just stared at her you know anyway we're at the drinks stall so the uncle heard everything
okay
this is not the first time she did to me
I still have hours in school and I'm trying to like
forget what she said
but ya so people start posting my pictures online
and say about like how I act
I mean
ya
ya
council you're the thing you're popular but
that I say it you know so it's pretty tough to make friends
cause my own friends
like
kill me from the back
ya
so I learn everything
from the start about how
ya
come back to school the next day and see the same people and
like you stay in school more hours than you are at work generally
people at work don't care about you
there's nothing about ya
people are there to maybe get money
you know different reasons but for school it's just school people don't have other reasons
so that's a hard part
label with
wow
orh
wow
one wish
I would say
whatever people say about me I tend to believe it's true
like you're a boy you are you are like you act so rough
you are this you are that or you
are that friend
as people like to say you know I mean
I will go through it you know
ya
ya
I think I never think of what you
want to think of it's cause I tried to stand up for myself but then again cause of confidence I tend to be like
mm
mmhmm
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I've been talking
oh
have to work for the money it's what you're saying
oo
ya
mmhmm
like you have no
eight to five job to go to right oo
what are humans catered to do
travel I think
but oo
just think about the human traffic here and there
and there's no limit like I think work is what limit you
you're like okay ah I only have like a week okay I want to plan everything right
cause I have to go back to work the next day I think that's what we are meant to be doing
but if we have no work
that's like a life of a retired person
I would say
they do whatever they wanna do use the money
uh plan their day but there's no rush which is a good thing
cause there is no time limit for it anything that you wanna do
cause we are not
um you don't have any commitment to something
mm
mm
wow
I've been there before
ya should I say the one I've been there before or should I create something
again
cause bali eh bali balling okay
it's a mini paradise
if you want like a bigger paradise people would say it's maldives
and stuff like that but I actually wanted to go dubai
I am an expensive girl
no I want to go dubai for sure cause my number one bucket list since like young
is to go dubai and go skydiving in the palm jumeirah
ya
ya
yes
that's why I want to go there
like scared
level seven is already like now I live in level seven
it's already too high for me I used to live at level two
all the way but this one is level seven
oo
you know what I've known you for quite awhile thirteen is too much for me
the floor kan it's not like the straight
so your house it's already scary for me I don't know about skydiving but I wanna try
you're being no you're going with me
yes
screw secondary school
screw bullies
a'ah
ya
mmhmm
ya
okay
ya let's go
for free
it's free
but what
ya that's all I think I will go
imagine being a traveller
like working as a traveller
how risky not how cool how risky
it's up to the producer tau
that's risky
okay
mmhmm
in specific
mmhmm
generally
drama
it's you I
I'm not a movie person I cannot commit to any episodes actually
but if I have to choose romance is me
ya romance is me
I like romance
oh you know what a good movie that I never get bored of even like after ten years twelve years
ya
no really
no joke ya
I'm like a
hardcore fans of white chicks I heard they coming out the second one but
they say twenty twenty kan
twenty twenty hasn't been that great
but you know
anyway ya your turn
since you've been asking me
your genre
mm
that's the thing I don't like to watch
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
we're not alone
of course
ya
you know I love that ya
mm
but something that really shook you up
oh ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya
money
ya
mmhmm
ya
but generally in life
I like to think that
anything can exist
as long as you prove me like
the opposite then I still believe it exists
you know what I mean
that's why as long as it prove to me
that whatever my thought is it's wrong
it doesn't exist then sure
but for now I believe in anything
anything
ya
apocalypse
how
ah
ya
infected
um
wow
everything is it's a circle of life you know how we started is how we end
overthinking ya
ya let's not talk about that part but um how would we end humankind
there's COVID pandemic thing already making people killing people I would say cause it's in india the stats are getting higher and higher
numbers are going down and stuff like that but
it's not gonna go down to zero we're not like vietnam or something was it vietnam
like the the first country that went zero
all I know is like ya taiwan taiwan that's the one ya
but like how long could that last
and how long could this um virus itself
exist so I think humankind human itself
would be extinct due like a virus
cause it's gonna start killing yourself like softly wow
it's gonna kill us slowly
ya it is actually
gonna kill us slowly cause we are finding for
a cure
you know but I have
I have faith
cause if cancer can have its cure any virus can have its cure you know
a little stress
oh ya ya
oo fun fact we only know twenty percent if I'm not wrong twenty percent of what's in the ocean can you imagine eighty percent left
ya
mmhmm
ya
and find ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
it's not mandatory
ya although even uh during the haze period it wasn't mandatory it wasn't right
I think also adding on to like how
human would end and stuff
climate change
um whatever we put into the world is what is being given back so when we put like a lot of um like
a lot of burning and everything generally
it's gonna brings back to us cause we're like we are breathing the same air as what we burn ya so ya even the icebergs are melting
so
even the bears are
killing themselves cause they know they couldn't survive in
right so
a lot of things could lead up to that
there's a lot of what ifs
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
is
hmm
if only I have like a good platform cause I feel like every
every individual has its voice
that's cause we don't have a platform I wouldn't say the platform is famous being famous cause people with fame
has a lot of power
so ya
instagram ya that's it but if I can have
influence over at least a hundred people
I would have a platform where the people my age are not even aware of this like they
everything so lightly
you know
it doesn't find us now so
so I think
it's to create a platform where um
one should know
whatever they do whatever they think of
matters now
cause it's what like even the
government in any country has said
like the young people are the voice of the future
so we have to do something about it now
instead of just following through
you know
mmhmm
for the rest of my life
wow
um
okay
shoot
meat
steak wow
everything
ya
boil
oo oh ya
ya
I think
a'ah eh
okay
karma
ya
what goes around comes around
we always tend to think the best of yourself
oh
oh karma
typical straightforward that everybody does it don't lie and say you never done it before
it's when you could help someone but you did not just cause you're
too lazy or too tired
you're just like
ya so
so I think that's my answer
it's it's the time I didn't invest on someone when I had the time
when I had the choice I would say
the choice to put my time invest my time in helping someone and I did not
I think ya
yours
ya
understanding you
what you give to your parents
I wouldn't say disobedience though
ya
ya
oh you're talking like a part
I wasn't thinking about I was thinking of opening the lid at the same time
ya
ya
that's a good one
cause I always think to
to like with parents there's a thin line between respecting and being like I wouldn't say rude but like somewhat disrespectful
but I think with your son you're doing good
ya you're doing good right
ya
ya
actually understanding though
people get tired
so I think my dish
is reasonable
the time is reasonable
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
mmhmm
oo
oh we're talking about
good body or body or good looks right
we're not talking about generally like physically
for boys right we're not talking about with pairs
of course
so I think I would prefer
good body
ya good body
if like you're not healthy reflects bad on your looks
I would say cause looks
what's the point
what's the point ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
it only helps during parent teacher meeting jer
ya
you know health is wealth
ya
wow
ya
good one what did I do that I'm not doing now
what am I supposed to do
find like
something to munch
just cause I want to keep my mouth busy
when I'm supposed to keep my body busy
yes
really hard but ya
like it's just cause I'm small
I've never ever hit like
fifty five
but after I know you
no I'm blaming the fact that I'm happy
like whatever is on the scale doesn't matter cause previously I was like a
exercise freak
no I wasn't
I wasn't
ya so I had to make it like a certain number every month
like I have to stay that number
I have to be fit
ya
cause I feel like being fit is what makes me happy
I feel
but after
being in like work
not that I'm not neglecting my body but it's like I feel like happier already
like eating it makes me happy not like stress eating stress eating is different but it's ya but like previously I was like an exercise freak I have to exercise every single day
fives times a day no like five times a week not five times a day that's too much
like in a day I have to exercise three hours more than three hours
in the gym for that long
so
after that I stop
and I feel like it wasn't a need anymore
cause I was just forcing myself to do it and stay like a number below fifty
below fifty is what I always go for
but that wasn't happy
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
prove the fact that you're healthy
there's different ways
some people will find like um the way you eat or
the number of hours you exercise or
just from walking
people would define it as five minute walk and you're okay building the same that means you're healthy depends
but so far
good body
it doesn't matter to me just health
just health ya
for your partner when you look like that
if the answer is opposite
my answer is obvious lah
mm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
wow
wow
are you talking about me
cause that's how I feel
ya of course
mm
ya but any I feel like I want the money
or a house
ya or house
for me it's hard to choose one
there's only one right
ya so money or house
ya
ya just
money is cause I don't want ya
if I don't want to be materialistic but like somehow
people say like money can't buy happiness
but it helps a lot
of course and you know it helps a lot
at times ya at times over like buying something for yourself doesn't make you necessary happy
but just giving it to people is
self amazing ya
ya
easier ya
mmhmm
ya
it makes everything easier
so that's what I would wish for
ya
a house
mmhmm
ya
like a space is what you need
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
I think you just wanted space for so long
just your own privacy cause privacy matters you know like somehow
not saying that you don't want to be around family but like
privacy
is what we need at this age
cause we've been through like go to work and it's too much
you just want to be home and you want to be lazy
just to recharge
ya
think of it that way
always think what you don't have
cause if you always feel like you're content
you're not gonna progress and progress is like a big thing
so ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya
patience
ya
ya
both
for the thirteen just now I would say like the confidence

izzah is which one
to dabao for us is it

scared cause she knew that she could like never leave like the nest
I mean ya lah
ya
ya ya
she's like super smart so she could like probably like get a scholarship and sweep it off her feet because
that's why she works like so uh hard lah because she knows that her position is like not

uh
she gets like uh awards lah she's always like the top two because err my friend daphne she has a four point O which I didn't know until

I don't know leh I feel like we will like
go back to how we were
ya we would have to like make our own food you know farm or whatever right it's still kind of like work
but maybe it means
oh like a depression ah
wah man I don't know man
ya I think will be like if you don't need money to survive right do you have other means
it's like a dystopian game
if it were me I will just sleep
but if you don't have to go to work
so be anything lah whatever people need lah
ah you give me food and I'll give you a hug how about that
okay what is it must listen first if kiss can kiss on the cheek
but please I hungry if not I just kill you lah
but that's an interesting question though I can't imagine ah cause it's too far far fetched already
but you realise or not like apocalypse themed movies like singapore don't do that imagine in singapore context we do that I don't know how it's going to be
ah that's true lah
ya
but apocalypse in singapore I don't know sial
how is it going to be
of course not lah it's like gradual
ya
ya ya ya
but I feel like if ever lah got apocalypse in singapore I think all the races will finally get together and will not think about actually being coloured
ya like
come on sis
extinct
ya ya ya ya
what's the question again
I think
I mean based on what I see in the news and all that I think err global warming
would ya either we drown or we will run out of food like there's no more resources left that's how ya we become barren lah
which is like most likely but imagination wise I don't know leh
oh because of the pandemic now
ya ya ya ya
that's my legs
spread ah
oh
ya
ya we already cut oh wow
no
bridge
um break down
wow how convenient sia
ah
swordfish
ya
wow
so like trump
ah
we'll be the last to die
our import export don't have already how
lose oh okay obvious at each country or ya because it's like humans were extinct rhino hope right ya lah so no choice lah actually depressing
lose weight
ya
yay
I feel like we'll extinct it will be because of a flu like we will sneeze too much until we get dehydrated and die
hopefully not lah eh now already COVID it's so scary
err work ah
eh
but something you already hate right like something
oo everyday activity
that is torture yes
that's torture that's too much
is it
oo that's like work seh babe
oh this is a game
ya lah
I think eating for eight hours is a torture also that's like why would you do that but
exercise normally already torture
exhaustion
sial lah chores for eight hours
ya ya ya
therapeutic
okay then maybe not
I want to say sleeping but then
I cannot torture myself lor
so many things
why I rather die
ee that's sick
hello
I know I want to be able to make someone have diarrhoea
if I don't like the person it's okay no need to say anything just like diarrhoea
ya they won't they won't think it's me also
ya and then you can it can happen anytime you want
see the ghosts because I'm like
claus like can make them do much for me
ya lah but I'm also depressed so I feel like I can lah
that's true lah hi
I'll just make I'll just make them a K-pop group ah then okay go around and stray kids
ya I think that's the side effect of his power ah
ya I think ghosts more than people
but then why you say that you want to see ghosts is it
ya but your super power
ya
most of them are quite bullshit lah but the one the real ones like
oh
ya ya my friend like that also but the fake ones I like because
they quite consistent but
is like why why must you do this all the time like
it's a guy ah
kan like I find it very hard to believe ah
like
no he's very old I think that time when I was dating him
ya four years five years I don't know
yes
it's quite unusual also
ya
oh ya ya ya
ya I can make all the guys be more
ya
ah yes
yes
realise that
I think she had to
ya I get ugh
so he she cannot say any rumour
a'ah sia but it's in the fifties
men
I don't like him from the get go already I didn't like him
ya
okay
awesome
wow one thing only

my rent free right
ya I would save a lot of money seh if my rent was free but then by living with your parents is your rent is free what right
it's true what else
damn

wow ya they should do that mm
ya
oh we made it babe
I feel like food should be free lah
no there's there's there's confirm like ration lah
maybe not in for singaporeans ah maybe
ya that's true oh my god but
okay good luck for your interview
okay yay

it's good for the eye
okay thanks okay
you want to start you say ah
how's your day
okay so was what happened okay I'm going to rant to you about our friend
may
basically what happened was she's not happy with the
six weeks thing right
so yesterday kan she I told you she texted me she was like she's going to do something about it I'm like ya you should do something about it
so
today
oh miss not happy I'm like okay so miss not happy then I told her already what what's happening
yesterday right
then cheng san was like oh I think she wants to like
convince everybody I'm like ya I know that's what is happening
and then may was so extra he started he made a whole group called scheduling
so that group is called scheduling
and she was busy talking about how she interviewed these people these people as in like five people two directors and three
and ming gee that's six people okay
and she's like oh some of them say they are open to it
um and some of them said they want six weeks and some of them
say oh they confirm don't want that three weeks I'm like if you have only six people out of thirty people that's not an enough like
enough like amount of
sample group lah if you were to compare with the
thing you know
so ya I'm just like
annoyed
but
ever since then like okay I'll tell them that there's this like zoom meeting there will be a zoom meeting next week by the way
so
look out for that
I mean her guilt tripping thing is like a form of
guess loyalty like
you don't want to do it oh so you are going to be the cause of my downfall that kind of thing you know
which is so
her lah and it's
ya she does that
she can get very selfish very fast when it comes to
her work especially since when she's worth banking
and I find that
a lot of the times she never even bother to like work hard from the start
she procrastinates a lot which sometimes I get it because
we got our own issues and everything
but sometimes like
dump it on everybody else ah like
you got your own issues then
ugh okay whatever
so I just like did it bye
good luck
ya but I mean this is what happens
this is what happens when you like live in a right you cannot
control
hi we are failed students and
this is us everyday when we do thing
sub for school
she won't stop
I'm just going to submit this time ah
then now she go
like you get the actual
cost and what size she want to sell cause she just take the picture
for like
a lot and then she's like I don't know
it's so funny ah
oh she wants like the square one which I think is about that size
but we don't know how much to charge yet she's looking at like the market price but I told her to look at
cost price instead
yes
eh
do not off
mm
unfair I think we should be guaranteed to have like a very quiet time at this
hour but
I guess not
it's quite crowded here and
kim boon lay kan
man it's just generally quiet lah also
the only night shoot I did
I can remember well was syaza's syaza's shoot
but syaza's shoot jingle was there
serangoon but the landed houses
I forgot that cats are like nocturnal
I swear
ow
but ya I'm quite nervous about thesis
I did like I moved my to dos
to this new app called notion wow
so it's like a thing on youtube now right
the notion thing and I've been using it for awhile
then I moved it all on notion
and now I'm like a bit overwhelmed when I see my list
ah I don't know lah it's like I know that my mock is
progressing much faster than a lot of groups
but I cannot help but still feel very insecure about
my old place
ya
and I don't know how the double producers are going to like handle it
considering I'm already struggling with one uh huh
it is supposed to be simpler
I got nothing to say ah
we we go out like three times a year
apart from school to be fair we we meet like everyday lah in school so ya
ah ya
once every twice a month
okay lah
ya
but it's it's alright
and it's I actually enjoy this song called favourite nightmare by blanks
it's blanks like
blank page ya
I don't know it's very groovy
eh but okay so
there was like a dilemma you know that I like songs right
and then right you know the new song dynamite
so the new song dynamite came out right
and I cannot figure I like it or hate it
because it's super catchy and I can remember like the words
I feel like
it's so full of autotune these days
in the song itself like it's a trend to like
and I'm like
mm I don't know how to feel about it
but ya
it's still fun the videos kind of cool they shot in a studio and the build the whole like
they have this like scene and they built the whole set in a studio and it was super big
but it was quite cool lah
super big and it's like an actual like
door that you can like slam
ya so the walls even though it's fake it's like
strong
good job K pop
like the hotel del luna
okay
time for us to learn
how were
ya man like you know you know about that boy I think like ten years ago he he's from right
mm
this malay boy and he graduated and he didn't know what to do so he learned he studied korean language
no thoughts head empty just went there and hope for the best
and now he's like a translator for like so many K pop groups
because he can speak a lot of languages
self study the whole thing
so good job man
ya I think it's quite cool lah
I don't know
I cannot remember someone shared like that article to me
but it was like a long time ago but his lawyer always tie him ahead I'm like huh
maybe I should do that duh I will never do that
my social anxiety will be like ho
ya
but
it was an option ah
work ethic
considering
we are dying now
mmhmm
oh okay
cause your your your heated my my I start first eh one for one eh
I don't know I always thought one for one was kind of dumb
because
you know that the cost is much lower
than you buy half the cost you know they have to do it like at least like what
third three hundred percent kan to get like a proper
profit margin or something
so I usually don't buy one for one unless it's like food
because
the
satisfaction of the heart costs
a lot for me
compared to any material things ya
okay but ya I usually don't buy one for one and I can't remember anything that was
quite bad other than maybe like
I always buy things like notebooks for one for one
okay you I know it's heated
depends I guess
just appalling ya
huh
are you sure are you sure
but only did that right when they first opened at century square
they had the it wasn't one one exactly but it was
that was the deal that they had
but I don't know they have a good reputation kan a lot of these like youngsters like to buy owndays nowadays
try off the shelf as in what just
it's like feeding our insecurities computer act one day it's like oh you don't want to talk to people
here you go you know just come in
and like try on this bunch of specs you know
and then I don't know whether you try on or not so now like fifty people come and try on this specs in one day
that's kind of nasty
with our pandemic and everything
now I know they closed down the
owndays
but still right if people are going to try out the specs it's a bit like
nasty ah
I have nothing to say about that ah
that one
it's actually up to like
personal responsibility and like social responsibility kan
it's like
you cannot compromise one or the other especially when we're talking about pandemics because
the virus is not going to choose you based on
whether
you are you are all by yourself or with other people you know they're going to choose you based on whether you are living or not kan
it's just like my issue with the the way they
relay the message of this like pandemic thing like how many people
migrant workers and community cases like as if
like it's the same thing both is humans
that fifteen migrant workers right the moment they go out right
obviously with everybody what with the
people that can be under community cases
just like
weird and another thing also was that
but my friends
and family members who are working on hospital are saying otherwise
so that's like another conspiracy that's like covering up
aiya it's so
shady
but we know that lah
but
but just what like
mm but that's what like breaks your breaks your trust
in the government and in the media right which is so sad
like I remember going to thinking like wah I'm going to be a journalist
you know I'm going to tell like
stories about the community and spread the truth
but even the well known investigative journalists are doing it for the headlines let's be honest
just for the clout right so it's so sad lah like
we we have to rely on random people on the internet to like get real information
which at the same time people are making use of to like spread
false information
nice that will be such a good like ending line but
we are only halfway through
we're not halfway through
nice
and we have to do more than what we see also because
mm just be honest
it's not just writing and radio it's the whole thing
another set of like nut cases
everywhere aiya it's just
it's not that your like childhood dies it's more of like you start realising
oh okay this is how I'm supposed to be like tired and depressed everyday
but it's so sad that that's the standard
especially when people are like
is this a competition like are you trying to say invalidate my
tiredness
I just want to say I'm tired okay cause that's how I feel I don't want you to feel
insecure for the way I'm talking to you
but now it feels like a competition because you're like oh I'm more tired than you
so I'm supposed to like help you
feel better about yourself
I don't know why but ya
I don't know it's just dumb people are dumb
I agree I was people
but that's not true
I don't know lah
it's similar I think
it's human nature
that's true
I started
like looking into investing my money
honestly like watch stuff how people like really become millionaires
and they're able to like retire
at what twenty six
but it's very interesting like
they earn like a lot of money
but some of them I met I'm like I don't know how you all going to like be able to sustain that
you know what I mean because you're playing with stocks
which is like playing with
our economy going up down up down up down it's so fun like you know
mm
but that's how people grow their money right
investment
but there's still like that's still a grey area right
because I mean
the reason why gambling is like not allowed is because
addiction that you can
get stuck to it right
but do people like get addicted to stocks
to the point that they have no money
you know
just like my
ya
but you know what I mean
but we have no firstly we don't know whether stocks with gambling is like gambling
but no one is able to like
explain it
fully
so I'm going to keep my options open
if you don't go off the deep end
it's fine
so
yay we love grey areas
aiya and then some more with this globalized version of the world right
everything's like merging right
you know
like
different cultures and everything and it is to help the people be able to like
practise the religion without
you know and to fit the lifestyle
time how much lifestyles merge right
in like fifty years right
because this is
islamic law kan but it's not like
until the scholars were like hmm
we got to do something about this you know
so more like the scholars in fifty years be like hmm we got to do something about this
you know and help the people cause people are going to move you know
like if a singaporean girl goes to like
I don't know the western countries
you know
she's going to bring her culture there
then it's like hmm you know
culture changes also so it's like ugh
just
like I don't know I always thought about that I'm like
it's still going to change like
I think if you ask people people will be like it's not going to change ah but
I'm saying okay
like if you look at the history of how this was made then
it only makes sense that we should be moving with the times
cause at the end like the source of the religion is not about the law but like
and not
whether
thoughts of this so deep
moved a circle
really ah shit
sorry
ya it's just a
it's a general discussion
it's about globalization
but I love tiktok
eh I spend a lot of my day talking err like watching tiktok
I don't know if you can tell
sometimes err sometimes I never notice then oh marina is like can you stop then I'm like why
and then she's like do you know how many sent I'm like no I just go
ya I forced her
I told her I wanted to send you stuff but
then you're not even on it so how am I supposed to send it to you I don't want to download everything I said that then she's like I'm not going to be on tiktok but then the next day she's on tiktok
looks like I got it
I made sofia go on tiktok also
she was shitting on her friends in school
so she was shitting on her friends she was like
oh all these tiktok girls that's all they know tiktok then I'm like it's the same with you what all you know is anime
you know you cannot talk about anything else why don't you try and like
learn more about what they like so you can
you know be friends with them lah and then slowly
they will also learn to be friends with you you make their first move I said that
then she's like I will never do it
then my cousin did it
and now she's on tiktok also
it's just like okay
mm
that's a lie you send me stuff
okay sure
did you read about the the tinder algorithm
I didn't know they had like a
ya so apparently
in two thousand fifteen like someone exposed tinder's algorithm
so like when you first join tinder
like the algorithm gives you like a point system of how attractive you are
ya so if you are like like the more people like you the higher your
attractiveness level will be
but if the person who rejected you has like a lower
attractive level than you then you would automatically go down
because someone lower was like you you ugly you know and then if someone like more attractive than you likes you
then
your attractive level will also go up and that was the algorithm
few years ago
and last year they just changed it into like they said it was
a secret
but
everybody knows it's very similar
it's so shady like
wah I don't know man
are you saying me and jufri have the same face
attractiveness level
eww
do I look like that
so I already quit
so so in a few weeks because I've been super busy
and I got no time to even look anymore and I feel bad
because
all these people are like waiting for my reply and I'm like err so I just deleted
the scariest part is when
cause on on the app kan I I
at first I put my name
kan like my whole name I'm nabilah
after that
after that people could find me online you know
on like instagram and that was so scary I was like
this boy
just like me
and then I haven't even matched with him yet
and he already found me on instagram
luckily my instagram is private lah and then got nothing
also cause I don't post but
it was just scary I was like whoa people will like can find me anywhere
someone's going to find my like my baby photos then I'll be like
go do something with it you know
ya but the weirdest guy was still the guy that
who asked me for my instagram then followed all my friends
ee that's so disgusting
what a weird guy
ugh
oo I have that family member
you know that family member I don't know if I told you about him but he got married already lah to one of my mum's cousins
so basically he became with one of my he became friends with one of my mum's cousins
in secondary school so he started like
clinging onto the family
in that ten years span right
like he tried to get with that first girl that he was friends with
and then he went to all the cousins around the same age
and he was clinging to one of them at different points of time
then in the end there was this other girl
the girl who he got married to
so that's like
it's very long right I cannot five years and they and she was like dying to get married to him
but he wanted to study overseas which is understandable lah because when they got together they were super young
he went to study overseas then she got angry then they broke up
he was like
very sad about the whole how it went down
and then he got married to this bitch I'm like
ee and the guy is not even that handsome he's just
he's ugly lah actually he's worse than jufri
ya
I think they lazy
it was so obvious
that's the worst part
like
are you okay
you know and then
uh but his
he's weird lah
I don't know I've never really liked him at one point he was the singer of the family then I'm like I didn't know he was family
cause I see him like twice a year like
it's just funny lah ya
it's weird there was this other guy
that I knew so he got married to this indonesian lady
they had three kids and then broke up cause the indonesian lady was a bit like a wild child lah
after that he he wasn't together with anybody for like a good ten years
then he started trying to get with one of the maids
one of our indonesian maids
but it was like damn disgusting
you know and then then you know then that maid didn't want him the maid was like eww like that's disgusting
after that
he tried to get with this other maid and that is his own maid
and I'm like
I know it's kind of disgusting but luckily the other maid was like
eww no and then she got married to some other guy
indonesian much more handsome and fits her
cause she's very pretty
and this guy is like old the ah the
guy who wanted to go with her in the first place
ya the other maid is only like four years older than us
bro he's like double her age
crazy
indonesian girls
it's a thing you know it's crazy
oh my god
like
I thought it was only it goes on with like
white man movie that has that kind of kink for like asian girls
it is funny ah
mm
I think he
he's crazy ah
oh my god that's that's like the the kind of guys that I will like shut down and not talk to after that you know
it's damn stupid
ya
I don't know
mm
it should swing that way
but I like male male chefs though male chefs are like
pretty cool so far all the male chefs I talk to are like
I will cook for you then I'm like that's right
it's like the first kind of the first group the one of the only groups of people
who will be like I will do something for you instead of you do something for me you know then I'm like oh
that's a good change
but I don't know
ya
oh my god when you don't have passion
gone
that's the worst kind
it's like I I I ah ya
it's like I get it lah okay like not everybody can have like a
passion passion you know
but I think you would have like some kind of outlook how your life would turn out in like
five years or something
or at least like ten years
like how you want it to look like
but no they just like oh I just
do like part time and
nothing much then I'm like oh
nice I don't know how to go on from there you know
it's funny
mm
like I'm sorry
I'm sorry that your insecurities are acting up because
I got to where I am
like I'm not saying you never worked hard but I worked for what I am and you know ugh
now now sometimes also I'm like
I don't know I find myself like
downgrading myself
just to fit a guy's standard
which is so sad
you know like especially if I really like the person
because of whatever
trivial
thing
which I obviously don't like them anymore
they'll be like
like it's arts school it's nothing special
it's arts school okay it's so special
mm uh you're doing something so
cool and then you have to tell this guy it's not that cool
just to make him feel better about himself
about himself
aiya and you feel shitty about yourself I don't know I hate people
maybe I should just die alone
good for you good for everyone I don't know
uneasy
that is just not my style
aiya my worst match just for ego boost lah lately only when I sad
then there's like the the
monthly cycle of like your emotions right so they always talk about specifically
but but they never tell me is that it goes on for a whole month
the cycle so sometimes it dips back down and the moment it dips back down right
it's the utmost match swiping
with that one photo of myself which I kind of like
ya like this is what you think of me
I don't look like that in real life mm
it's quite funny ah
there was a guy who asked what what was my weight
then I'm like I don't know if I should
tell you
because you're obviously not
here for me but more of how I look
and he's very curious because I didn't put like a full
like length photo
which you know
from my face sometimes you cannot tell now can tell lah then back then cannot tell
that's so funny then I was like if I tell you
what are you going to do
if I tell you I'm like hundred and twenty kilos what are you going to do
and then he was like
err
I don't know I think I will still talk to you oh you think
then he he left me after I said I was sixty
if you know I'm not sixty obviously
ah that's quite funny
I mean
mm
actually I'm the same lah
but I short lady ah so good for me
mm
I'd feel iffy about it lah but I I'll still talk you
you know I'm like I'm eh I'm short right
I'm let's be honest I'm short so I I always thought that
so the guy that I will be it will be a higher chance for me to get a taller guy
cause still all of the
okay the that one time I actually went out with that guy
he's too thin
that bitch like okay he said he was
taller
and I used the you know the calculator app
to see how much taller they did show me the actual science
cause I was like I don't believe him he looks damn small that's what I said
and he was small and
and I bet he was like huh
and I couldn't hide my my discomfort he was small
okay I'm not thin you know
I'm a big girl and so short he is small and thin
and I'm just like okay
you know I almost paid for ticket right for the movie ticket
because he didn't want to
pay at first
then I I just like he was like nevermind I will pay I guess
and then
he look at me he look I look at him then he like
okay I'll I'll pay like half I'm like okay I mean I thought you're going to pay for your own ticket lah bitch
cause I think you should be paying for the ticket
I didn't know that we had to discuss this we don't know each other so aduh it's quite funny
I didn't know it was a thing that girls paid for the ticket
I have nothing to say
maybe that was his experience
compensating for his lack of
height
ya
he was damn smart though the way he took his photos
it was all from the bottom up
I was like
this is like a technique I will use I guess in the future
aiya
I lazy ah
ya
higher angle eh
is it I don't know
I don't have people to take for me like nice photos and I I cannot like pose also
so I feel like the nicest photos of myself are like when I never even realise someone's taking a photo of me
because
I'm not
insecure
oh
that's my only photo that I use for until today because I don't have other photos
it's so sad ugh
ya
I have so many selfies
after at the end it's like
like that
it's like it's like cheating myself like okay this how you usually look like
it's quite stupid lah
okay lah at least I rent a smart eight one lah
but he's damn tall sial
he's damn tall to me lah
you talk about him I'm like oh
ah
ya
she you should ask him to like hold
sarah just texted me
then I'm like
ask him to ask him to hook up a camera and like take a picture of his view
it's okay lah he sees you like that what and he still like you so
that's all right right hmm

err ya just more of a
ya it was supposed to be the ninth whatever

just ah iskandar I think they if you see like ah anything that is pertaining to family ya or the family like she won't really like
say out you know I think ya I think and that's that
ya
thing
ya
ya
actually that's come a long way man she is the first nisa I know
that hung out at like ah sarah porch and like we all hang out five of us or four of us
ya she she's come a long way man she just got pissed drunk nisa

aiyo that girl
know that day like err the staycation lah with me ah it's my birthday ah
I I I just lay down on her lap and I just started bawling
like bawling
my emotions I'm like ya I I
no babe it's not just her I think if any of us is like no longer a part of the group or even if let's say some shit happens some drama happen and one person just decide to okay
you know evaporated that's we will feel one babe
which I doubt to to be honest I don't think that will happen lah I mean
ya kan
they even even
ya
ya
at that point of time I was I I understood I understood why sarah
got pissed off about what happened you know what happened right sort of
ish
ya
tini
no to tini to tini so
no so it's not that um
on that day
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes

like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told tini
pizza
so sarah

um this tini and then sarah went ballistic already ah cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
no tini didn't want to talk what
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause oh maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
um and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to ah she she said that
err bash thing
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could ah tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
nisa did nisa did

I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya

but it was but the the first then she did the chorus in two days
so the first day um afro was like in the corner
and it doesn't bring me like joy you know that's the dissatisfaction
right
so like the first day cause I will maybe I was too focused on like myself but I didn't notice the second day it was fun because I was surrounded by jokers
ya only the person in front of me was dancing correctly behind me she's she's one count behind me
so that says something
huh

um it's it's more slice of like okay parents um so I I guess I prefer that time rather than much of anything with actually make the things I haven't watch you must be you weird okay but it's just very very promising and stuff ya that genre is is I mean that's microwave you genre which is shown and
oh but then again cause I'm not keeping up with the new ones
what is it about
okay okay
okay
ya that genre is is I mean that's my favourite genre which is shonan
ya
okay
okay
ah
explode
a'ah ah
okay strength
okay
oh okay wow
I thought I thought you were gonna say set stuff on fire remotely because that
because pyrokinesis is
but no one else has powers
mm
huh then how does he talk
ha so he just hears his voice in other people's heads
so people think he's stupid
oh my god
okay okay okay
you watch two episodes
three episodes how do you watch three episodes
right oh you skip you skip the
you don't you skip the intro and ending right
huh serious ah
how many episode is it
oh you mean like each season got twenty something episodes chey
no I'm asking total
okay okay sorry sorry
it's okay
slice of life is one thing that I never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
actually I want to see I don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite gundam series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do I really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
mm
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy lah like
like you know brings us together
that's rude
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
hmm
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
ya
although it did start lah it did spur it it started my my thing for gundam so okay fine fine I give you that bandai
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay lah fun
hmm
ya
yes so how did it go
hmm
she's like tall she's so tall
hmm
right right
I really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
oops
huh
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore oh okay she knows eh
wow
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
mm
mm
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
oh ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
mm
ya ya ya
okay
oh ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments lah
ya
correct ya ya
ya
sassy ah
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked uh najhah about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many eh
maybe at most twenty plus lah but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as naruto and all that with like five hundred and two seasons eh three seasons eh in all that kind of
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is twelve
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
I guess ya lor like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know I didn't realise how important do you think so when I watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area

so you never actually knew how it looks like
exactly lah it supposed to be a little like teng teng teng I mean
oh yikes

I mean I know you might not feel like it because it feels like
ya
ya ya correct
ya let her it's not about like a restrictive right
ya exactly
um
oh

mm
my superpower is to control the cat
like for example they pee or poo I will I will tell them go and clean up

K my superpower is
or rather the superpower that I want is to be able to read without feeling tired
noob sia we will make horrible superheroes seh
err

good looks or a fit body
for your partner
I don't have both
hmm
okay so good looks ah
K good looks
ya lah I want to ask now lah so choose first
good looks or fit body
K
good looks or personality
then
ya lah something like etol lah you cannot say that he has good looks what
siala
I told you I didn't want that
I told you what
there's a possibility that
um
mm
mm
I would prefer
oh okay okay uh good looks
but smelly as hell
or ugly but smells good
but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K lah I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
the distance between each eyes is like right
you can wear mask what
okay err
the the ugly ah
why
hello I'm with one
I rather be with an ugly one
then with someone who stinks like shit like aman
okay err
mm
would you rather
have one million dollars
or
err
or a good job
or a job that you really enjoy doing
like everyday you wake up
you just want to go to work
and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay lah one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
huh
huh
I don't understand
mm
mm I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no lah in singapore first lah
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya lah what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and uh basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya lah with the money then I will do that lah
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills what and then the cats I rescue them and then what feed them what
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya lah
cause I will invest also what so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
a non-profit organisation
huh
uh uh I cannot lah
volunteer ah
then you get to play with the cats sia so cute
bring lah
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya sia like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside

like she told me about the possibility of the
okay err
okay nevermind let's switch topic first since like
we cannot talk about it now
um
mm
but what
oh ya I wanted to say
I feel like
papa has sense like
huh your friend can see
what kind of places
no
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
you saw
then
mm
mm
mm mm
mm mm
and then
and that's why I thought I said that
cause his family also like
his side
if I'm not wrong
ya lah
when I as I grow up and then I try to understand all these different cultural practices then I'm like ya
we cannot be like so dismissive
when there is a possibility of it
mm
ya you'll never know sia
and he's not that like great also
no but I really think that he did send something for us since he like cannot be around us
I think
I think
I think
I think these are all signs of
delusion
adui
I don't know ah
oh but sorry maybe you cannot be his wife
diam
ee you wish
you wish sia
ya sia
no but
making some decisions that I will regret
why he staring at me
why why do you look so sad
but I will buy the graduation gown for them
and then I'm going to do the photoshoot cause I already sign up for this photoshoot package
siala it's been like a year
and I still haven't go
and then uh you can bring like family there's like uh
your family members can come and like take photos
so they will give you like don't know what size and then they will give you the softcopy and then if you want to blow it up to a bigger one
like poster or what you can do that
but
like leceh ah like I don't feel like taking also cause I look so fat
so ugly
but if only I can bring buttercup and blossom as well
do you want to take pictures with me do you want to go for a photoshoot baby
hmm do you want to go for a photoshoot
eh so cute because on Shopee I saw like some pet costume it's like
a graduation gown and then with the mortarboard siala how cute would they be sia

yup so you gonna graduate with me buttercup since you have been studying with me all along
my god buttercup
why
it's okay everything's gonna be fine
no we know azizi what
but I really feel like his family practices all these nonsense
ya
with papa's side I know it's like the feeling is like damn strong
I think he has the ability to practise all of these
no fuck no
no freaking way
no
don't want to learn
ya and then go to hell after not like as if I'm not going to hell also
why would why would you put yourself in a position where people want to like disturb you
ee
siala I think it's much easier to just kill you seh
only akmal wants to get near to you
ee
ee
and you want to live in a farm
and you want to be
your head
they will feed you dog meat
oh well I'm not being racist I'm just being stereotypical
eh in a very joking manner
I don't judge them I judge what I read
from the internet
no no but there are some of them who are very nice
like the like the shi</mandarin that I worked with
I didn't judge them
I'm judging you
siala if
ee please ah
so what's that sound
ee siala I'm pretty sure the person listening to this recording is like
they will like Google you because they have your full name and then they realise siala this girl is she as pretty as she makes her out to be and then they Google you and then they realise err in the image search is like
and then the person will be sending things to you then
ya lah send you a
hello
send you a mirror
hais I'm so tired
ya lah
nope no more makeup can save you
if I'm the doctor I'll just give you an overdose of anaesthesia so you just die
eh
ee
siala
so classic grandeur sia
ya but this is grandeur
that is not big dreams
this is delusions
okay I know I will send you things
and then when I finally work there I will see you there
I don't want to counsel you too
I don't dare lose my job
and I can't counsel you anyway it's unethical
that's not big dream
that was the first question I ever asked
ee siala

I'm not saying fat chicks are not pretty
there are some that is pretty
no
the aqilah
uh
and then this one spilling ya literally is mama's body probably ugly sia then I keep telling myself

what it's true
so that's why I'm watching what I
huh
what
ya lah you one meal is like

nobody eats briyani with egg
and briyani
ee
it even overpowers buttercup's will to want to steal my food also

then after that nobody reply okay nobody reply then after that she was like uh if you guys don't reply I'm going to leave right now
then like I think one of us grab there grab to bugis
anyway ya back to that story
ya lah I stress so much until I at the end of the day I don't even dress well
mm mm
oh ya
okay okay okay oi
ah light festival
a'ah
ya it's obvious
good times ya
ya lah
mm
mm
ya
ya mm ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
anna nah a'ah
ya same
ah
a'ah

ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay what is it
ya
oh
so this will be your third wish lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
the first thing I'm thinking about being rich of course everybody think about being rich right
because being rich you don't need to even think about like uh
you got momey problem anything right because you already rich what
you if you like like what you say become a billionaire right once I become a billionaire I'm also going to buy a house a car
for um
is benefit for myself and my family lah
so we can bring whole family go shopping together ha
car is actually benefit for us to go everywhere lah
when you got a big family right it's much easier
ah rather than now that we having difficulties okay like emergency we want to go
anywhere also we need to book a grab at least if we got our own car at least we can drive
straightaway and bring
I mean like something happen uh we can bring our parents or maybe we can bring our siblings or
touch wood lah eh if anybody
ah emergency at least we got car
we can drive straightaway to the hospital
ah so we can save for the ambulance money so we don't need to pay the ambulance at least we save the money so once you think about money ha
everything about money lah eh
because although once you being rich you still think about money ah that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
uh stable financial eh
ride their own bicycle to school ah kan
so from there also safe you see everything think about money eh
I already think very far lah kan
ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
then after that
ah you say that you read about the news kan
ah but like what
two months' time right about two months' time so okay lah not bad lah
so why not then
so at least if we can use that uh one hundred uh dollar voucher lah
we can save up money save up some money lah
to buy our own food cook our own food so we just picnic
mm
uh huh
mmhmm
ya correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
um you know that uh
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
ah they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you lah
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest uh maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso kan
mm so like that better right
mm
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
err
ya lah marina is nice ah
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
splash
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think that one is quite cheap also
because um that time I saw a youtuber
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this lah
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
ah
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
ah so maybe we can go for that one ah
mm so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you ah so we no need to go for separate rooms what
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk ah
cannot gathering ah cannot make side illegal gathering
ah cannot gossip ah
so at least at least lah mm so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
have lah
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle ah I not sure
but they can uh ride on the bicycle right
they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride ha
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part lah that we can do
ah
maybe we can plan saturday morning
mm no maybe afternoon
oh ya because actually we don't want
um
we don't want
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
mmhmm
the next morning we go cycling
oh over there if I not wrong got burger king eh
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin ah
ya that's why
but I think uh over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure ah
hmm maybe we can search everything
um
inside the
google
you can search what more activity that we can do over there
mmhmm mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I don't like to roller blade lah actually right I want to go snow city you know
but everybody say don't want to see seh don't want to go snow city say boring boring boring the I say okay lah nevermind lah
you want to go the I went to go ice cream but nobody want to go with me
alah huh
nobody want to go with me then I see just forget it lah
like that lor
maybe if can why not we go right
but actually snow city correct lah it's boring lah because you need to play the slide slide only
because that time when I school time I got go right
ya very very cold
mmhmm ya you need to wear very thick clothes
ya they give you glove
of course
because that time I go with school right it's a school activity so everything have been paid
before we even go for the event
ya
yes correct it's very dirty
ya
correct
wah we die
mmhmm
ya
but zoo is so boring
that time remember go on our birthday april is like so boring
you can't even play with the animal
ya I want to play with the monkey
then I want to touch the lion
but I didn't get to touch the lion this time
last time when I small at least I got to touch you know
lion
that's why
so it's a hot day man nowadays also it's a hot day
if like I aiyo if I go there eh
right that's why
so I think we should
plan properly ah if we really want to go for activity
ya
obvious ah they going to bring their children because nobody going to take care since
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
ya lah I think um
will love it okay will love it
the one that is suggest just now
it's a nice view lah
ya
not bad right
we really don't have enough time for each other also
but got zipline or not
oh ya kallang right
rock climbing right oh ya ya ya
ya that's why but if I not wrong need to pay you know
I know
if I not wrong have
maybe we can buy some snack ah
but you know like this kind of
always have uh family gathering kan
mm
they
ya but you need to book also you know
a'ah
you never know sometime
people want to walk inside alamak inside your tent
oh ya we should have a receipt eh mm
after we already book we should have a receipt ah
hmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
a'ah
mm hey ya
ya

ya
mmhmm

ya
ya okay lah

mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm if like
hmm
a'ah

we will ask for off day
on saturday because sunday is already his off day what
mmhmm
mmhmm

mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
so at least we can save lah save a bit
like over there mm

about one month
I rather work at from the office
so between you and me the the the experience is different lah
ya
how long how long
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
then my drink then how how how is that
effective ya
mm it's not at all also
oh my god and the
and he he is used to that
mm
and your room
oh okay
or

Yishun correct orh so you got straight bus there lah
technically lah a bit lah
compared to staying at ah compared to where you are now until

uh the best position is which one or not the first one

when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person ah so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
the industrial area at Woodlands there lah
mm so they needed manpower uh so they asked manpower from my company so so ya lor
mm
yup my current company lah so this this this the the the the workplace that I work for
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them lah mm
mm
ya lor so that's why I when I ask you how how was your experience for the packing I understand lah what it means when you say fast paced
oh
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience I mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can lah
no ah you will learn one usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
and the pay is quite good lah
three K lah three K for I don't know how many weeks of working lah so ya
oh
oh
so you what you
oh okay okay can
mmhmm
mm
okay
oh
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest packing job is it
compared to your your your makeup makeup one
you just sign up only
mm then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
oh
oh but night shift though
mm
technically ah what time start
eight thirty must be there
then finish at eight
so eight to eight err eight to eight ah
oh
okay lor can lah then you better survive in this job
packing
is it
mm I understand
how's you and Andy
ya that is tea don't you realise it
mm ee I ask you first how's you and Andy
you and Andy on InstaStory
oh okay okay okay okay
oh
that's why you guys spend time together
mm
Andy Andy Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
oh I mean
oh
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
understand each other
good lah good lah
mm
not talk
mm
well good lah good lah at least
in in this relationship the two of you
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
ya how long already ah
what
three years
not bad ah three years ah this is this the longest
mm
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay okay I think I remember I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay lah actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya lah because his side he don't make it he don't
uh his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya mm
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like hais eh cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
err me and him are dealing shitty stuff now lah so ya
do you know what he's working now
mm you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram ah
oh
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya so he's an insurance agent
so under but uh under there's a sister company called
so err basically how to plan your how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
mm so okay lah
ah so so he invest I mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people kan
ya so you will meet new people of many of different ages uh different character
okay lah I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so um
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
fourth year in the relationship
okay so okay ah now I explain to you what happen
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me ah oh um
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like uh means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
get it so means ah means ah like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about Lina that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his
ah so that is the first time it happened
ah it
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
not interested lah because that girl also have a boyfriend
no is err volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for
ah
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional uh breakdown ah I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp lah like
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating lah but but but but
I don't I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct a'ah
so during is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
kan uh
ya
this is what I'm trying to say lah don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
like limited talking to new people
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is um
err way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say ah this is me ah this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit lah
so ya hais
no I don't know because
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to to end up uh like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me ah if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya lah
like that's why when you things like uh on Twitter will say this and that right you you wait sometimes you need to leave you you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
ah I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know lah
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
that's why I was I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
not exactly lah
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
yes sure up to you you can go ahead and share
mm
mm
but you you do try to recover after that right
mmhmm
mm ah that's the word make up
mm
ya lah
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
kan
mm
mm
mm mm
with him
mm at least at least a goal with him kan
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
we like I say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like err am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
ya so now I'm just like
uh like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I
met his parents
his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
haiya ya lah the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
my my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
mm eh
like
kan kan so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him with him right
mm
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
so far so far during this period right
where uh like
mm
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story lah okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware sia
err like I don't know a week ago maybe
he's
I know I understand
hais
hais
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I I hint only lah I hint to my mother only lah
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to uh
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya loh
on my Instagram I think people can like oh okay Hans and Lina is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
mm
too
I have fallen for him too hard that uh now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person lah but
that's my that's that's what I'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
ah it's just me expressing my emotions
mm and and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
huh
ya it affect
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
I'll just knockout ah so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing lah
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
then
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so um
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already lah so that is good enough
hmm ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand lah
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
ya ya ya ya
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
busy seh
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space seh that is good that's what I need eh
we just need a different type of um router ya
ya
kan that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
mm
ya means we need an additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the
how many wifi you have at home
oh you have two
one is at
mm so you are connected to your
parents' one
mm
ya
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
mm
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work your normal work
then we got Zoom meeting Zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we we we are all
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay I tell you now ah
err
I and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one err some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
mm
ah
uh
mmhmm
no just now one is because I had to do a a mini training for this ah tomorrow's training
ya
ya so ya lor
then anyways so I am starting another job again cause I was just
I was like quite happy that I I'm out of the community club
then on Tuesday I am back I'm going to
ah ya is to I'm going to do some homeless job you know as in err
pay to maintain the the the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just it's just COVID things ah it's it's it's it sucks bro hopefully hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal
ya
uh
mm
five hundred right
ya that's the rate for poly
huh
your is
five hundred
unless you work at retail retail will be eight hundred
ya so that's why I never like you get to experience internship right then
at least you experience the paydrop when you say it's five hundred for the poly we will say it's normal ya it's it's just the rate
as an intern
it's okay lah you already pass through the err internship phase unless you want to go degree then maybe another internship
being what broke oh you want to work for your own
up to you your decision you still got like half a year to go
September
ya you're graduating April right
ya
or you can take a year break and work then go and study or you can study part time and work up to you
it's your choice
mm
but what degree you want to take same similar or
similar as your the things you are doing now or
or you want to try something new
business ah
mm explore your options ya
ya eh not bad seh you went through like different certificates seh
kan kan then then when you have a kid right you when you have a kid right then you can say which one you want to know
I went through all ya
you went through N O uh and higher NITEC then diploma if you take
degree you go degree ah if you go further ah all also you have
oh it runs in the family
uh uh
ya like that ah depends ah what you want
me
mm
ya lah that is because they have the knowledge
they don't just like assume oh I am from
then they treat you like shit ya
I got no motivation so ya
okay
oh eh eh err
okay can so um
alright okay bye bye
Z

oh so this one is um actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding kan
tru
um but again I thin
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
oh ya lah that one I think normal lah since my time many years ago also same also lah the thing ya so I think uh ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for lor at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least lah
oh because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
mm I think I think in this case ah I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
more fundamental lah but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya gemod lah gemod is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know uh his side ah
hundred fifty ya seh hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise lah it's lik
like okay in that case we do separate lah that is another alternative ah other alternative then your side then ah then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech oh wah like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
uh bottom line you both must tel
err got two choice if want to combine the
then err you and hairin you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
extra guest whereas for his uh no need then you leh you just you just invite lah whoever that is important between your lis
err then is like you al
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say ah
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
then after that I think um at that tim
we buy some things on our sid
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all lah ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually um pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push ah you no need to type ah you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes ah food ah food dishe
you will you will see like ah how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
uh tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of eh um
uh what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place lah then after that uh if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
uh then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
ah so then from there oh then you all like oh okay lah then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
ah so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline lah so that even though you got five months uh to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say khatib uh when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like uh the cabinet or whatever because I believe uh you got to check that one lah renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask err K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this lah there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that ah so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it lah that is one part of it ya so ya lah so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care kan
my only thing is that okay if he's uh you all have to like let's say workout lah the thing lah workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it uh on i
oh I think uh
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan lah
but then you have to stay in one place for two years lah or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking err is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay kan then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that ah
uh take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming lah so there's one one idea you can hav
you can have the big wedding but err we have to burden one of the side lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat lah kan
okay so err if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then uh so you spend lavishly ah your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion uh of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
oh ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide lah
ah what they want lah ah because I thin
err mix up what is it like like you think that oh what I want to have oh I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it lah
in other in one I read about in err on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing lah
I don't okay y
both side actually exchange gift ah how many you want to have it depend
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow lah no need lah I pay now loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
okay what righ
ah but I think in today's context can be just lik
if not screen shot and then you se
if let's say you know the oh your partner ah really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either um
like I said lah is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
uh get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like err like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
ya lah she wants the opinio
ah there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like err the person uh then where the family said firmly talk oh it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that uh kind of situations o
err kills the that particular portion lah but in this younger generation in your generation err things have changed progressivel
they cannot even get flat eh they must buy a condo or private propert
ah high ceiling income but then err there's one period of time he changed jo
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know ah and then they finally got it ah then but there's a word then the reaso
err a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple lah ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no lah to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already ah
like very stress then me leh then ho
uh you know the more th
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception um but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
you know and ah both ways lah both parties lah so uh people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects lah
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
ah then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then um you can't convince your parents lik

have you watched the the the the what the marriage
ah the world of the marriage it's on Netflix now
so you watched the first episode
okay um for my this is my opinion lah kan

the the the lead actress the wife the first wife behind her back

eh they said this primer not good tau
then you don't use it
I learn makeup from TikToks and it helps a lot
only use on your sweaty area which I think your cheeks don't need any
mm
I think that now my makeup stays stays longer now
cause I only use powder I only use foundation over here
over here and over here
here
then after that I use the loose powder
uh the brown brown colour what is it called
contouring
then after that use powder

a'ah the dodgy way
the diamond glow is it good
okay

every time I ask you for things
where's Odella now Odella was like everywhere
people still buy
did you all lose weight if through using the that Odella
a lot ah how many
how many kilo you lost
wah in one month
but
what you wanted wasn't weight loss then what you wanted
really now did you get your already
is that
oh
then you thought you dropped out

okay
mm
what type of superpower I want ah
because err even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
um
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
um ya it's not a
err
err to fight crime
like
err and they don't just fight
err those on earth
people from
the aliens
both of them ya
how about you
uh
uh
mm
mm
bat batman or iron man
uh
mm
specific
ability is to fly
mm
mm
powers
doctor strange mm
uh
oh
mm
orh
mm
mm
ah
ya hogwart that one ah
ah
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
mm
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation ah
teleportation boring ah
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train kan you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
mm
mm
okay
mm
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
mm
um
mmhmm
mm but people need what
okay when you are rich you might not feel that oh money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million lah not not like that lah
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
no you should
mm
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
err
let them err
it might be a it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
mm
it's a
power
ah
ah where you can give to people
uh huh
okay because most of the villains in and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
mm
but how
I think that one is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
mm
mm
mm
mm
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that err no need to work lah
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that eh why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
ya
mm
mm
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe err
err
err superman is boring lah or maybe the flash
or
mm
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
uh
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
uh superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
mm mm
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
mmhmm
ah
okay next
no no that one they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one lah who will fight
wonder woman
err something like that lah the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
err letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once mah
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
stream
apple uh
ya right
ya
apple apple lah the I
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
uh
they'll new movies will go into
that one produce by Netflix that's why they do that
free
ah
so
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
ah that's how they get their for themselves monthly subscription
uh this is how they fund their movies
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
that's how they make money lah it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
subscribe and err upgrade their
account
from one person only
mm
let's say
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
they can they are they are free to pay any amount mah to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
you fast forward eh you
mm
mm
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
mm
mm
uh
orh
orh
okay
mm
superpower
mm
very burdensome power
what is the most burdensome about every power
about every superhero sorry
what what's the burden
with
great power comes great responsibility
ah ya lah what's the burdensome about every single superheroes' superpower
mm
mm
ah
what about
what about the batman that doesn't kill people
mm
so what the batman need to do from
actually
burdensome
okay superman burdensome

thor has a lot of flaws
thor has a lot of flaws
he can't be the king of his own
people
ah ya lah
that that is flaw lah
and then he's
he is not a god he is more human
he's not a god of thunder he's a more he's he's more human
that the story is just telling people that he's not a god he's a human
no he's not a god because he has flaws
he can he he can die also
that what the story is trying to say is even a god like him will so god has flaws

october
you know
um
then
sarah also oh
me and nashrul all meet ah
cause sarah also busy with her
but
then supposedly my is like tuesday and thursday
but um now we like on campus training instead of virtual so ya
then I think semester two
which is I'm not ready because
it's physically and mentally tired
ya
so um
when your exam start bro
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
for me like for example eh
um I would consider ah because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
exhausting ah like what I see that's why I really
then for me also like my results it's um released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also eh will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like um because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
so like
maths jer for that day so like after that day they will like grade us oh how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want lah of course my expectation is higher
my A also my my A
I think is not a lot also
then
so like
um
it's okay
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them oh what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure um and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise kan and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me lah then my daily grade from
like it's important subject lah
so ya um
then
for sure but um for my actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable lah
teacher will give us like uh practice questions to do
eh eleven five nine
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time um
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to um type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for is
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before um eh like when you presenting and all
then um for me kan like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
whatever I say kan confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya um
ya
and then
also ya
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
ours
is different seh we like on that day kan the presentation on that day you have to ah prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break lah kan
ya
mm
and it was uh two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like

the zoom is about

hmm one month
or is it prorated
so the cut off date is eh there's no cut off date is not is a full time pay right
but that you only get paid mid of the next month
ya
this is like my workplace the full timers get paid mid month no twenty twentieth every twentieth of the month they get paid
my one for temporary is only end of the month they actually not ended end of the month
is not even end of the month is seventh of the next month
what
what is actually right there is no cut off date some more so it it's look like you're working
forty days
but you get paid can already
but most of my bills will be end of the month my phone bill
oh gym
still ah anytime fitness
F forty five
oh Fitness First
best
ya
what
I also don't understand clementi is
uh huh
huh what is all these polis
oo okay
is it like walking distance
oh
office
ya is because like now you don't have
you know err a proper working schedule
so you can go any during the non peak hour period
okay that is cheap
for one month
no lah like how did
oh is cute
huh
not one three six anymore
so everytime they will change the
cost of the
actually
like the promo will not end lah
mmhmm
oh
but you are paying the insurance no
so that is equal
like one fifty lah roughly
ya because is cheapest deal
hmm
but how do you know like whether you are doing the right form
oo
oh ya
but have you ever thought of joining F forty five
you were from F forty five what usually when you go to work no meh
you were still working there
during the F forty five trial
you were still working with us right
yes I remember
yes
it was
mm
but after that you never continue your F forty five
and lesson oh ya
I want to try sia
yes
except for you
ah
mm
ya
you mean by reps ha
oh my god
I know one of the one of my senior from poly
but
what I know now she is working at
F forty five as a trainer which is shocking
mmhmm
she's fit but
again she begin without any experience from fitness
then
no don't have she she was just a freelancer for graphic design
then now she's a trainer
if you see right
all her videos her
story
she will be training at the gym itself
at the studio at F forty five studio
and she improve a lot sia
east
serious are you are you serious right or are you joking
but gym trainer I I mean the receptionist
sure
yes
maybe after closing ah
after closing you just close the gym and then you can have the gym to yourself and no training that's all
yes is not the receptionist job hey got a cleaner for a reason
barry barry what's that
B A
woo
oh okay wow
they all so fit
khai friend what happened
as a receptionist
okay what is he doing now
khai
why
mmhmm
oh okay okay okay
what
mm
he bailed
okay
ya
hmm
they just throw him in the office
and give him work to do right away
no training
oh my god
then he quit
like said goodbye to them or just
very what will be like so tragic like if you went then they might where the new guy
did the the manager or supervisor call him
ya
well ya
but then the part of the contract term is
oh is the just for this job is just for two month so there's no contract lah
then it's okay ah
then got
how much is he paid for this two month
huh
ya and he has it's office hours monday to friday
one point five
really meh okay lah my first
but not admin
no pay lah like he he he didn't even clock in the entire day is only one hour then he zao
wasted sia
ya what happened to the brooks brother
no the thing about her
ah I
last september
then I already photocopy I need to fill up the form
for uh for claim any any kind of dates I need to fill up
I already submitted by end of err end of september
the end of september
seven or eight october
then uh when I receive my pay in november recently I checked then I ask her lah luna I haven't received the claim that I was supposed to then she said oh is it let me get back to you and that is on six november
yesterday was twenty first right
twenty first november I texted her again I asked her hi luna is there any update about the claim
and she never reply
she never reply I can show you
I mean twenty five twenty five twenty five dollar and twenty five cent may be may mean nothing to you but
you see
when it come to this one she just disappear
ya
I mean come on lah I'm underpaid in the first place I know we're not supposed to share about uh our pay
but among our my colleagues all of us actually
talk about pay
yes
for me I'm just temporary there so I said I just said oh my paid is one point eight only
and then my another colleagues she also another temp staff she said my pay is one point nine
ya
then I said is it
then she just said maybe is your agent don't want to fight with I said I did offer a higher pay but she refused and she said oh the rejected don't want to pay any higher
is a shocking lah
because
to compare me and her
no her experiences is only from C K
ya
so it's not fair I I have
job experiences
from what retail from high end boutique
from H&M
bridal
so
I don't know how they actually
I don't know how they actually gauge the pay ah
maybe but job the thing about it is the job ad put two point two to two point four
and I actually put my expected salary as two point two because that's what the job said what job ad said my previous full time job I get two K what so
shouldn't you at least
ya follow up with the same rather than you know paying me lower
and then got one colleague she one year contract so her pay is one point nine same as a temporary staff one point nine leh
one year contract
so one year one year contract shouldn't she earn more because she
yes because
their workload is much more they have to do emails and then they have to do sales as well at the same time
maybe
and then there's new guy coming in right the one that replace
the bing for the ya that's the new guy
and then he go and say how much she got paid to my other colleagues that got paid one point nine
more than two point two less than two point five
you I mean
contract one year so same same contract as her so the workload is the same
experience wise ya
she has a diploma cert
he only stop until
from
changi
yes ah
yes
so is he he also worked there for two years sales only
no experience in terms of emailing or what this other colleague she even though
but her past past jobs her intern job are all related
so of course lah I understand why she is angry lor then
ya she got paid one point nine he got paid like two point four so that's like five hundred more eh four hundred more
yes
so one one point nine she brought home one point four eh one point six ah one point ya ya
ask maybe
your ya maybe your trial period pay
even if it's not trial period right actually is by project
yes yes exactly I I mean I also don't know lah like try your luck lah then she said
no lah but then if I said it like that right surely my the manager will said you never read the contract properly
her fault
kan
cannot lah sia I don't think the manager will even talk talk to us about that like she won't be comfortable discussing this matter cause is not his
liberty I means he's not the one that
gauge how much she should pay
he's not the one that agree
and do the interview
is the right
but that means she has go through
no
sad sia
she is
because she's got paid the same as how much I've I've earning and my job is so easy eh
is just doing sale
no pressure no nothing
even though we don't get commission lah but still we are still doing our job
actually their their pay is is good leh for full timer
two point six
email lah I mean one thing about about that is
you have to do email while you're on the sales floor
is not conducive
then after that you have to stop doing your email you have to serve the customer
then after that when you go back to your email you forgot what what you want to say already
cannot like that what ya exactly like you need you need a space for you to really sit down and read your email
and during her off day also you still have to do work you know backlog
you have to update the you have to update the shit
saying which one which case or which customer case you handle and then you let's said the customer follow up or the retailer follow up you have to you have to continue you have to update
yes
yes that why is not that I don't want you to have the job but is just it doesn't justify the pay ah
yes and is not only that sia
the big boss will be
yes
cannot you cannot said that
I I want to ya because I have four days leave mah I want to clear my leave
but if let's say
this year cannot applied already december somehow december there's already people on leave already
and december is the christmas period so you cannot already
good luck ah I I thought taking leave cause my contract end second february so first second and the last two days of january I take leave then I zao already lah
good right don't need lah for what
come back for what said goodbye
I don't have pass
is just uniform I can give them on my last day all clean ya
I don't need that or probably they ask me to wash after that I come back one full day one of the days to return the uniform
and pins
they don't they don't care
from what I know lah
hopefully like let's said I rather not take my leave and get paid
you know you get you can get paid right if you never take your leave
ya ya ya
but I'm sure they don't want to pay the extra
if one hour ten ten dollar
one day eight point five hour
so eight five eight five times four three hundred plus
I rather take that three hundred then taking leave
but if let's say I can applied leave
from
no plan
actually
yes
no the thing is he offered me a
but it's more like I design for him a collection he wants to come out a clothing brand
so ya but he wants me to
right
he wants me to design but he wants me to come out with the brand and and take it as my brand under his wing
the whole collection okay
is not my brand I don't is like louis vuitton
yes that's a beauty director but there's still a designer for the fit right yes and staff like that so I told him that way then he he he finally agree to it then he said okay lah we see how we start out with one collection first
so then when I take over it I cannot work with raki anymore I don't know whether he confirm or not because there's no there's no update
but yup
ya after this job ah then I can focus because I still got another one more commission project not commission lah is more like I do it as

err do you think we should stop the recording now
okay but you have to keep
talking because
you
but if I talk and then you don't respond to me then what's the point of me talking
okay but so are you checking it now
should we just end it how do we end it do we just stop or what
now
okay okay okay

I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to um another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
mm
click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you ah they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
ah so
yes ya
then you can you can use their err
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you lah I'm not sure about your personal one but my school one has like
um my school's background
err you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show lah
mm
K
mm
so when you click share screen right
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
it will show everything that I go
everybody can see that
but
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share lah share
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
ah you stop share lah
ya so you just stop share
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
mm
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say um they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that one is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
allow
she chose don't allow
pick the stop video I mean I mean ah like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
mm
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
thumbs up thumbs down
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands uh put down your hands yes no
err thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs ah hands up
ya usually at the participants area lah
ya then like just now you can like
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want siti instead
so siti ya and then other basic things is err okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
okay so you can choose between like err record on your laptop or record on cloud
and then I had to record the classes
ah I chose
the first mistake was I chose uh to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
mm so so I had to I had to
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
mm ya
and then some basic things like chat
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host uh even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which err will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
uh instead of everyone there's like person ah other people's name all the participants' name lah then they will have like bracket privately
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
it will be altogether
mm ya but that's just like
mm other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
forty people
so I will just
I'll just be like err there will just be a notification that pops out uh proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait lah
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
mm
mm I guess so lah but like
cause
I get
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just err
it will just be somewhere here lah
like ya
google meet or live outlook something like that lah
mm
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal then you just copy and send to people lah
mm
but just now you had you had something on
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
mm but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries lah
ah
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
ah
oh
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
huh
the gavin err
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation what
oh then the escape room is they create or what
welfare pack kan everything is online now what so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff ah
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with lah so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like err cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical one or something like that but like
maybe maybe ya then they
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather um if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay what to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that lah
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried lah we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that lah like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
mm
and then like initially I wanted to
uh produce like three different
to produce one instead
engage in home-based businesses
like it was supposed to be
release
oh it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of uh
they open lah but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
err we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
woohoo
ya our target was four hundred dollars
four courses a'ah
err each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my um
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half lah like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible what it's not to rely on like
kan so like that's what he said lah he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
mm but ya not not there yet not as
mmhmm mm
ya then we're like that's quite true lah
um no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is oh third is excel and forth is um
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like err in our faculty there was there's another group
oh by the way I won a giveaway from them
ya it's a just a makeup set lah ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
oh ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
ya
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course lah ya
and then fast forward err
like
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him lah I was like oh will you be interested oh I ask his number from my friend and then after that ah I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
ah but ya it's just it's
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
uh two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like uh extra class notes and he even like answered err post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
oh but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like
and like
ya and he
oh he was err he was chosen for and Facebook or something like that like I know like uh ya
prestigious one lah but then
but he in the end he chose like I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
mm really meh
mm okay lah ya I guess
but he's really smart I'm just like wow
how is someone that smart
ya
soft launch soft
soft launch for what
oh the Staple B is it
bento set
oh
mm
but like what does his dish contain
fragrant white
right
but it's like is it meant to be healthy or like
oh
what else is inside his dish like it's just chicken and rice it's a bit like plain no
but I saw the pictures it was quite nice
ya
it's at novena
so is that good
oh
how is going to earn from that
ah
so food court lah
that's basically a food court
mm
that's a food court
there's like a bar right
ya like it's a
a hawker semi bar kind of place ya
mm no but I just do my assignments like I'm swamp with assignments now
ah it's focus more if your if your room is conducive lah but
no but like
I don't know like I felt I felt like you get burnout quite easily if you
stay at home a lot and cause for me I don't even go out at all what I never go out to study I didn't even go out like back to school to like cause all my friends
no but like over there I guess it's conducive quite a little bit conducive I don't know I don't know but
but like
so many places
where you tell me where
like I don't even know how people study in tampines hub
the basement kan you're talking about the basement right
ya the is twenty four hours what
ya I mean how can people go inside without going inside the area
ya
oh no cause COVID then now they
oh but library now they open
I think
bugis the national library and like some bigger national libraries like tampines library they open like
for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online lah
like I don't mind studying outside but
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is oh my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that one my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams err assignments to do
six
all different lah so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
twenty four hours ah
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can lah but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you lah but
like it's not not
neh
no but it was
it was so much time lah I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
huh
no lah
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
oh you look at
exactly ya
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
oh no but
but one thing bad about online school was that err
orh okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module lah but
ah generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
no the answer is no
oh that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
like err
about the same so let's say
in this uh my first mod then my second mod right I have like um my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
um let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like eh it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like yay no exam fun what then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like huh why I never knew until I experience it
and my major err
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words lah
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major one
and then two thirteen november okay then this one is okay lah relax lah
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two lah but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam what like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time lah then now I think
some period
now and
two eh no week six that's the crazy period lah cause that's the like now now is my chiong period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster lah
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
that's that
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
err result for my which one
my four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
mm
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you lah
ya
huh
oh no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments kan
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case lah cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that what then I think they don't want lah
ya but
I guess it's it's okay lah
like
mm will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did lah
ya
ya
it's like
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni lah I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my
cause when you freeze your then cause of my now is is okay lah I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
ya and then after that
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
mm
mm
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like oh
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
uh our sem two kan sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email lah they said like oh like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no cause they were I think
so they said cannot lah like
I think only countries to europe
asia and
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there lah
ya
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything lah
but the thing is my
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again lah cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
you have to wait
you have to wait another year lah so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do um online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause uh you're it's actually taking
right
no it's not
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if uh
they don't let
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck lah we just we just trying to ask but
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then um the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
and obviously the school will not allow it lah
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore what if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can lah which is damn unfair cause it's just like
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
eh
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous lah
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first ah so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options ah to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay lah no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now what it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
oh ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision what remember
like for me to enter my my
but ya oh did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know lah
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report lah
ya but no the thing is
mm like cause some people notice like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
then like people like
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything lah
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know ah just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
uh what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release err a statement lah saying like oh increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know lah look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
um my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like oh like it only happens in everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous lah
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report lah like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic ah
like everytime another one comes and then like uh yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that what

err I'm studying I'm working I'm uh I'm now in college central I'm taking floristry course and um I'm working as a deliveroo and grabfood

mango is just like you know
we can't talk much about mango because
like what my brother said everyday everyday we eat mango

we like
rarely talk about it you know
uh this topic came out from my brother
don't know how to talk about mango because mango is just so many things um so many things to talk about so
like
you know it's all stuck inside our heads like we cannot think of it but then
you know it's just mango
of course not
but we can make it you know
make a new recipe
because
like we said mm huh mango we can do anything with it mm huh we can just do anything with mango
so you can just put like what Sprite
smash up the mango and then make it a mango soda you know
of course not
one of it is you know sometimes when you leave your mango outside for too long
um
you know when you leave your mango outside for too long and and then you never eat it like for a long time and then
when you will have the appetite to eat it er
after that while
then when you start to you know peel off the mango and then you see this um rotten part of the mango
then you taste the rotten part of mango and then
your appetite is just lost
but other than that um
uh this is why we have to um always keep our mangoes fresh
and keeps our mango um
um keep our mangoes fresh and then keep like um you know inside the fridge what to let it cool so that it won't rotten that fast
and um
other than that uh
uh ya it's ah after you like what he said like um
and then you blend it
it will definitely taste like ice cream like
it's like a mango yogurt ice cream you know something like that you know like
um
like a smashed mango but then it's frozen
it's cold it's like not it's like it's like not the normal eh err mango is just like
you know like
ice cream tasty like
mango you know
and um
for me personally I like mangoes that are cold
because I
don't like um
because I
like summer days ah you know when you eat this
oh my god
I totally forgot about it also
yeah and
oh my god how can we forget about that
when you eat during that hot weather and it melts in your mouth
you can taste the mango inside you can taste the freshness inside

very very like it's not spicy
but
yeah
even if

I am sorry to the flag for the first trial video it's not
idealistic
oh what about me
oh
ah okay my full name is rismawati binti razlan people will call me rismah ris
uh I hate I really really hate to be called wati
not my friends
okay um like I said I'm eighteen this year I'm uh I'm taking floristry as my course
and I'm having an internship uh by this september
err
like higher NITEC or because I'm still NITEC so I think I'm taking in higher NITEC or
maybe poly
but
I'm not so sure first lah uh ah like um I have to plan everything first and
you know move on from there
but um as for now I think
um then after that um english english my my english is not like my brother's english
um because his english is like really fluent
but mine is um just normal like um I don't really know how to speak english that well but
you know you know like don't know like how to say ah like I know how to speak english but then
I don't know some words I have like I still have a long way
to go to to you know to to know a new word
to use
and indonesian um
of course my brother can speak really fluent but me
I can my indonesian is really really rusty
like I can just speak a bit but I understand what other people say when they're in they talk in indonesian
ya that's one thing about me and um
I think about that ah I think ah other than that
there's nothing more I guess
err
like

oh that's some random thriller show right
what you mean bridge the cursed bridge
so is the cursed bridge
so it's about a bridge
I don't know now got what movie
can we watch the hunt
intruder we already watch
Greenland
want to see this one of the worst show in the world
like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
april kan lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it
is more of editing
make sense
ya cause it's a shit show
ya
okay you think about it
girl wants to be a guy
but she wants to fight
so don't fight if you can't fight
no
it looks stupid
no
then there's this one stupid dragon and small dragon with all the
all the ancestors
the father
oh so which mulan have I been watching
but my story line makes more sense
okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would mulan do that
what do you mean by no choice
I think I watched lah but I don't remember lah kan
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about mulan
so mulan kan
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
woman is not required to go for this one what this one
ya woman cannot go
but then why is she forced to go
oh okay okay okay I
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
I watched before
no no no I watched already you see
mulan go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick
then she go see this ice
place then err
then the
ah sick
so after she got sick
then she lie down then the doctor check check check err then the tell the main emperor emperor prince
coy commander err leader ah
meh she's a she's a girl
ya that that's the movie what right
she got caught in the
okay but then the most important she got caught at the ice place
by by who
hans
so is mulan like
based on the real life
let's finish the mulan first lah
haven't
okay okay then how about that dragon
with the
wushu finger
kung fu panda
okay okay okay okay wushu
wushu
okay wushu then the ancestor how is that
got to do with any cultural
significance
why not
why I just help me understand
no you make me make me understand mulan first then I'll make you understand aladdin
what do you mean I know that she got caught at the ice place
cause she got shot not got sick
okay why she go to the war
okay so
oo makes sense
nineteen sixty five eh
wow that's about eighteen twenty three man
so what do you want to know about aladdin
okay ah honestly I think it's stupid ah because
okay because
she don't let me drink water ah

like when when you have pen ah it's like what the heck
in kindergarten eh
wah really ah mukminin

that time we eat the dinner at Chatime
yeah and then you wanted to buy your first then you wait for so long
the brown sugar pearls right because its closing already ah I think that's why
two more weeks before intern
then what about you
hmm
I don't know seh I'm scared that I just hope that it will have that graduation ceremony lah if not we will be like the this year batch right they graduate through Zoom or Teams ah
yeah I know right will you miss school duh
but I'm glad it's all over already lah no the holiday where they enjoy
so what have you been doing ever since the holiday
yeah I see
ah for this semester
then get I get to poly this aviation course
but now a bit sad lah because COVID then aviation sector like
rabak lah
why
but okay lah we see how maybe I can go in maybe not I don't hope so much but I just hope the only hope I want is to be a stewardess lah I don't mind actually which airline as long as I get to as long as I get the dream job I'm working
what's your plan to do what's your plan tomorrow
yeah I watched that before I think that was in twenty sixteen or something around that year then I want to watch it again lah because its so nice yeah you should watch that
ha ha yes
yeah then ah do you want to watch a movie next week or something
train to busan
okay
what about you
eh you told me that ah she is going to stop working right
okay then how is your intern you got any updates
so you won't be alone lah
okay lah that's good lah
chey I thought you say like got maybe at least one more person with you at the same location so at least you won't be bored or you know
some more your house is at tung lok kiew right
and you are not familiar with place
its
it's still considered as internship lah because I'll be working with changi airport it just that I won't be getting salary lah
I think there will there's like another four people they'll be doing it with me yeah but then still sad lah because I got no salary then I have to find a the part time job to support myself
yeah I have one friend my classmate lah she also choose the same internship so I just hope that we'll be working together cause I don't want to work alone work alone
but they still get they still get paid like high salary ah like yesterday I asked my friend she said her salary will be eight hundred dollars and I'm like wah so lucky
yeah but for me it's too late for me to reject my internship lah because all the position close already so I'll have nowhere to go so I'll just have to accept that internship
yeah hopefully I can cope lah between the project and the job
no who enjoy seh
why
for long ah
what aiyo
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
like the participation level for us very low and then we get you know sometimes get downgraded because of that so its like unfair
physical class
yeah but wah this semester my grades okay lah decent only lah its not the grade that I expected
so how err how was
okay lah but it's quite hard lah to you know ask your friends or your faci then like through online cause no issue in the physical cause you ask your faci then he straight away come to you know like can get instant answer right but this one you need to write message or you call them sometimes so they busy doing things then they will reply like very late
so it's like
yeah correct lah better you by say then all your classmates listen right
okay so what's your plan after you graduate from poly
oh
same lah I also thinking like I want to go in uni but not sure what course should I take cause now COVID so I thinking of like taking something to back up me lah you know aviation may not be stable like even after COVID err finish
so maybe I'm thinking like taking up err finance or course cause like this I want to take a course that is like universal lah that accepted everywhere every industry so I feel like it will be safe for me
wah
I see like wah nowadays a lot of people do auction on Facebook
yeah
not sure I think some of them are brand new
yeah maybe then
now also people sell clothes oh now especially COVID they sell the mask you know they make themselves yeah
everywhere you can see that
so
what what do you want to sell like food or you know like retail stuff
oh muslim friendly cloths
yeah I also have plans to open up the cafe
yeah we should be partners
meal some
okay I actually have err thoughts lah like okay maybe this cafe is the small cafe I want to make it
you know of course like err nowadays students like to study outside like at Starbucks or you know those small cafe so I'm like inspired by that so I want to make a cafe that is cosy for them to study
but that cafe will have err it will start like serving you know just drinks or desserts drinks and desserts very small small one lah then you have like a space for them to study to relax you know have free wifi
for students to enjoy or even like adults lah those working adults they want to do their work there also can and then slowly you can introducing mains you know like appetisers mains and then maybe slowly expand to become a full cafe full a full
how to say that
like
open up like
yeah true lah
yeah so maybe by that time you know when it's successful then you can open a new outlets at other places
like err it will be inconvenience for them lah you know especially those who have who don't have their
who don't have their own transport lah like car or motor then they wanted to take public transport you know some places very hard lah even if you take a bus or you still need to walk like fifteen minutes away you know
yeah yeah yeah
but I feel I feel like err cafes in the west is like
quite boring ah
like I said
oh
yeah we should sell like those viral food and drinks to attract people
oh is it
I've never tried dalgona coffee before
yes
have you tried do it yourself
how does it feels like
oh yeah yeah sure I okay lah I mean I always see other people I always see other people drink but then like I feel like I'm the one that haven't drink it yet
err I think so should have ah
okay okay we shall do it
then what other
food or drinks ah
have you seen any new ones

so
okay lah let's
yeah I have a lot of game to play with you

ya
but then I feel like december kan school holiday
mm ugh
mmhmm
Pan Pacific service suite
um beach road
because you all going as a family so I thought like you'll be
better
it'll be better to have
an apartment instead of
a normal hotel room
mmhmm
then
then before that
then before that like before check in or after check in do you plan to do anything
in pacific
how many
because of the number of adults that you book kan
that's why they follow like
ya
eh eh sorry sorry
mmhmm
I think it's easy seh if you get like central
a'ah
because I thought like if you know if we have if we go for apartment instead of normal hotel then
oh
mm
is that the kitchen then
and then
uh
ya
like that's what I thought
because since
he's awkward either way
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya correct
oh
I think you should go I think with kids is fun
and because that time then that time she draw a butterfly and then the butterfly that she draw just fly around
ya I think since you got like a child maybe that is maybe that's fun
if not I can find for you also lor
that around december but I'm not sure when exactly but I'm guessing it's december it'll be credited to your SingPass
then like make use of that lor
or maybe if you not using that as a
I mean for your hotel then I think you can use for your activities
ya
hundred dollars
ya my
uh huh
sea aquarium
adventure cove
ya
then can also
then they have that lazy river
but then do you think angah will
this hotel also nice
have you gone before
I think you went before
oh is it
ya
because it's too malay
I mean like since
since angah like
I forgot it was a while back
like few years it's like a while back
a while back
mm can ah
at Noosh Noodle Bar
eh we have the same thing
we can quiet for too long
mm okay
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
you went so far and you ate you went to japan
to eat a
crazy ah
I also don't really like japanese curry
ya
maybe they like it because
that's their idea of curry like our idea of curry is different
ya so when I tasted aside he set up
in singapore dollars
ah okay
mmhmm
but then I feel like if you go eat overseas I think you don't even
feel like you're spending too much of money on like food
it's like I think I don't think you will mind
did you had the
Luke's Lobster
why didn't you eat it's so good
thing it's overflowing it's marvellous
so actually if you convert it's like twenty
ya
so it's actually pretty similar but because you
if you like craving for it just go for it lah twenty plus dollars
because I think they have like fixed
um measurement on how many how much lobster to put on the bun
then that time also I had this yakiniku you know yakiniku
the beef
Yoshinoya
oh no okay yakiniku is the
okay lah like that is after they yakiniku the beef mah
but yakiniku is basically you get
to grill the the beef
maybe because they yakiniku it in the kitchen you you don't get to do it
but ya
that
that time there was only one halal yakiniku outlet
the asakusa temple area
ya
it's so nice one of the set was wagyu then I'm like
it's so soft oh my god
I don't know when we get to go to japan again I'm so sad
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
I think
I mean it is technically lah but
okay dish
dish I think I would pick
like
let's see is soup like a dish
ya ya ya it is it is a dish
so that means like mee soto is that a dish
do you consider that a dish okay then I will pick
no I won't choose mee soto okay I think I will pick
um
a'ah there's like so many things that I like
hmm
I don't know
let me see let me think
he if given a choice
I would probably choose a seafood dish though
chicken
garlic
so good
want to eat ya true alright
okay
ya that's a dish
if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day which actor would you
want to become and why
you will eh she eh she got so many business
okay let's change it to celebrity
ya lah so celebrity who's
ya you have your own beauty line
some more you recently if you're rihanna you recently released the
the lingerie line
experience
a'ah
a'ah seh
maybe she got servants
she imaging the sleepover party
oh my god
a'ah
like got
don't know
ya
ya then after that I think he used
he used
and then they put there as a meme
oho like the circuit breaker
a'ah
ya
was like I'm
you all have to stay home today but the celebrities
oh my god
a'ah
that's why
a'ah
and then they have
a'ah movie room ya
I think probably we have the right to complain
aiya I think it'll be fun
can you imagine
like I cannot imagine myself
staying in that kind of house but okay
I would like to try
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
buy one get one free you get one
like the worst
thing to have buy one get one free
ever
I think it's
a bad thing ya
a'ah
mmhmm mm mm
ah
ya so that's one of the bad ones
lower on is free
but I actually find that ya I find that a fair deal
then ah if they like talking about things then I feel like I cannot think of any as of now
um
good looks
ya I feel like I choose good looks also
like the that like uh
a'ah
because like how do I say like good fit body you can train to get it
face
face is
at your head so I don't think like you know you can have like
err you still not a
uh huh
I like crime documentaries
a'ah a'ah
court cases
mmhmm correct
fight for their clients you no no no like he or she is not wrong
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya
right
popular
they still show but I'm not sure whether it's new seasons
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya I think hawk gate horror right I think it's
if the plot case is good
and then I think that um
a'ah
I don't
I don't think
I think paranormal activity is
uh like you know I don't ya
it really happened
a'ah the original camera
so I feel like a bit like okay
tactic
something new
but then recently I've been watching the bailey
bailey's makeup videos
the makeup mystery and murder makeup murder and mystery
but then I feel like she always
bailey she just knows how to like
make sure everybody is not
the longer ones right
there's this one one movie that she told
that there's huh
that she covered
uh huh a'ah ah
I haven't really watch
uh
mm kids
oh the movie is just recently
oh okay okay okay okay okay
oh okay
crime documentaries but then there's so many to watch
mmhmm
stress
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
and she effectively you know
expecting
mm
okay I will watch soon I think tomorrow
I would wish for
what I would wish for
I think first things first I wish for no poverty in the world
and then
is there something that you always wanted to
something that you wanted for like so long
this can happen you wish
mmhmm
or is it
okay like when you
ah okay okay
a'ah a'ah
true
castle
like
a'ah
like your own land
with a swimming pool and then you can have a tennis court badminton court
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think everybody
I think primary school
but then it
oh
mmhmm
SARS is just singapore
I don't expect
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
father daughter or like kids
mmhmm
what is it oh your your
father is infected with COVID so
I think uh
it's the same I think for now
one of the wish is always to have
a mask-free
I'm waiting for the day that we can go mask-free
like finally
I think like oh
I think like
like he
I'm like one step closer to going to finally going I guess
be hygienic
you're not contributing you know then not even safe
okay
a duh
oh ya ya ya
sembawang
who
he's like so young
ya
ya
ya very funny right
ya I feel like it's so weird
interning gag
grants and all that
I don't think that's a long long term thing
ya I guess
a'ah
a'ah
that's why because I'm
I'm not even an intern but then they
because I think it's like
because
that's why they don't let us do that kind of things
ya then we just answer we just answer like enquiries lor
like let's say okay mainly is about passion card lah
I think they like
people
from other working at other places eh like customer service wise right if they
okay for example SingPost
the other time they refer a resident to the
grant
for the self employee
self-employed people
so basically not all grants is under lah then after that they
I think people who don't
visit their community centre often they don't know that
not everything is
ya
so when they
oh um we actually this this grant is not under us so
ya but then they are the one who refer us here why you cannot help us so I was like
okay they referred you here without knowing that the cannot do all these
because it's also what
like
to apply for these grants you have to login your SingPass SingPass
if can
ya our own public computer to
login to your SingPass because it's mah
I mean like okay lah if you allowed there's there's
I feel like some people should be
understanding about this issue
the other day
the other day uh
the right
they referred this resident to
to the to change their address their
ya1
ya
it's so weird right like should know that they are the ones who do all this
ya
so they refer in
so when they refer it when we refer right and I was like ya we can change we can change your uh at the but then it will
it will take like a few days
but then if you want like immediate then you can go to the then I'm like huh
like it's actually weird this kind of things actually happen the other day got also got resident they come to the and they like
uh can you help me look for a house
ya they really they really come to the to
ask for everything they ask for literally everything
so like
imagine the amount of time spent to explain to them that
hmm)(hmm
not everything we can do at
so funny
and then some people they understand lah but then you know some people when they like
a'ah
that's why I say
ah
because now
now also everything is online
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
need to go down mmhmm
a'ah
ya it's like that so yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
that was the life every day literally
so the other time also
the other time also there was this one
there was this one resident
the um financial assistance for the mum and then just recently
as in the application that the application for the
is the one who is supposed to receive the financial assistance right
the she passed away so she asking like if can transfer under his name
then I said cannot lah because your situation and your mum situation is different you all not listed living in the same address
but
I'm related to her she's my mum why can't I have the money instead
ya
then like that ya it's a needs it's hard it's hard to please everybody
especially if it's like
racial
and then I couldn't help right for example with their their grants or whatever
and then they always said things like
ya and I'm like it's not that
ya exactly
so they gonna play they're gonna play the race card also
that's what I thought like okay I'm not gonna
remain in the for a bit any longer
because by right I use
mm ya
at the
ya
ya
ya so it's not exactly in the dormitory but in their office
so like if the
issues with the
employers
ah
because they um employees from different different company mah so that means let's say if the employer don't want to like
uh
then when I went to the interview they said to be mentally prepared
because it's super crowded I'm like oh
I like okay
but but then I'll be in the office what
just be mentally prepared lor
mm
no lah
mmhmm
they didn't decrease the pay for them
then your diploma when start
dah
that time you went for the medical interview ah
you went already
ya
ya the immunity is lower lah basically
oh okay
oh really
oh okay
oh it's at a landed property
oh okay okay I think I seen
it's a child care
oh okay then how many
children you have in there
so do people like teach
over there or no

I was like walking normally you know like you know you walking normally right like are there was nothing for me to trip on or like off or something I felt like something grab my ankle then I slipped
everyone was showered
everyone finished showering already
kan if you think about it because we took a shorter cut
creeped the heck out of me
aik
mm
yikes
they just stayed there lah so bad in everything smelt then the house smelt
no they say that
LOL
uh huh cause I watched that one
mmhmm
it's not painful
it's not painful and I mean it hurts your soul but not on your face I guess err I don't know lah I mean allahu alam ah eh
that's why I say I don't know you go Google lah I don't know what else ah
to stay young
right I I remember I remember a lot of stories where they say that they eat babies to stay young
people correct
ya ya I don't want to talk about it who knows they're talking the thing will I mean I mean
no it's
islam
welcome it I know when you give birth the one who will help you give birth midwife midwife I mean uh you hear stories that sometimes inside the
mm they see extra people inside the room when they
figure or figures of things like that because my mum said when she was pregnant with me right eh no not with me with my eldest brother she was disturbed quite a lot inside the hospital
taking it lah
I don't know maybe
but then again there's a lot of deaths in hospitals also so mm I guess understandable never wanna become a nurse or doctor fuck no
mm
mm
can you imagine like maybe I don't know
I don't know
I I told my mum if they're gonna like disturb me at my house also I'm gonna be like whatever I'm so tired I'm too tired I'm not getting enough
I don't I don't have I don't get enough sleep for me to deal with your bush
ya let me let me get some sleep first you come you you set appointment and you come back no because that time during I I
it prevents you get getting disturbed in your sleep but it's not when you are awake
different story it can go into your dream also what they say
that's why sometimes if you dream about something I don't know is it a like I mean a lot of like while uh psychological study said that oh it's just like uh was it what seh
they said that if it's pigments about fragments of life brought into your dream or something then they intensifies it or something but then again some dreams are so wild that you are ya that you can't help but to think
like you said what they can uh what is it ah they can show themselves to you or make themselves shown or something they manipulate your brain so like you think you see them
ya but then again right I feel like
it's because there are it's aiming you
but you know what I hate the most is sometimes right they aiming for you but they disturb someone around you
ya like they use they played other people to get to you
I was sewing at night ya I was sewing for my friend like like a kimono cardigan at night lah around four
what
no shit oh hell no ya but but I think a lot of the if you
correct correct then why you think who who pull my leg when I walk in the in the jungle what the heck right then all like when they throw things they move things
like the ya the paranormal activity kind of things right but I mean some of them are they faked they want views but some of them are not scared the heck out of me
with a camera right
ya like come here I'm already here for you come on baby oh my god ha
mm that's why ah
then suddenly she she was like she saw the chair move
like spin a bit she got scared she stand up and walk then when she was running for the uh door she got pulled back thrown thrown to the wall then like the the chairs and tables all like shifted
it was damn scary malaysia lah you singapore singapore I feel like singapore no matter how how haunted right cannot match like indonesian or like in malaysia I don't I don't know I feel like maybe because smaller
but it
the modern the more modern is it the the more religious you are the less likely you are to take over
I think oh I don't know I do know there some bomohs in singapore I think it's more of because we are more we are more religious like we are more modernise ah
mm
ya then I guess the I mean even your boob getting a boob job would like I guess you won't you won't I guess it won't expo and stuff lah but ya
I mean I mean
I mean like okay lah it's temporary or unless you like accidentally poke it or you're like what I don't know
is it ya oh because it will like corrode or something is it oh ya ya
okay
but ya
I don't know some
ah ya something like that I'm not sure
some people don't
or like or like or like if the wind blows right I got a I got a I got to brown my hair before my head
but this ya
err accord sort is it they show you stuff
like and stays forever
ya boy
mmhmm
but
the most people can they say you cannot die right you cannot die when
I don't know
not I think I think you'll be on the brink of death but never die
until you take it out or if you even if you die you are like finally die
you get it ya you like because you know right there's this like they say when you die
just because you your eyes are closed your heart stops beating your soul is not out of the body you can still feel everything
so basically imagine your daughter cries
you can hear everything you can feel everything it's just that you can't react
that's sad that's not scary that's sad
ya I think there'll be so frustrating you imagine your your mum hugging you and crying but you can't respond
I think I'll be sad I'll be so sad
ha
I don't know I mean depends on the family uh because you are unless
you not supposed to say this lah but unless the
pass to you
no lah what you wouldn't know unless you experience it
ya I think so it's an agreement lah basically you are agreeing what if you nod it's a form of agreement what no matter
like the thing picks its master
so like and
probably it will probably follow you around
how to say eh
I
lame okay and my mum said lah my mum said lah eh she said that the thing picks a master that is like
for real

it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot ah too risky
okay
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
uh how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but uh
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
WhatsApp
you know like the english one the not contemporary ah english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
uh uh lah okay lah then I I have to agree with you lah we go we put the partition that means
eh ya lah correct lah when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like um
ah like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
chey private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt lah all that lah so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny ah
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like uh
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
mm
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
uh mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
uh or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
mm
eh but the other day I went through um this hard zone or something lah the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across uh this person
uh he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else lah then it's already two K
just the platform
mm
I put uh under
uh extra budget column
in the planning lah so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then ah the service balcony you know the
the doorway um between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills uh window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it what so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay ah
mm
actually not bad leh you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that uh different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
wah I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
uh came to real life you know really eh so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like uh extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this one is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
ah
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else oh ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
err like the window grill I don't know
so but then that one I haven't research uh
but uh ya
I think I think it's because ah it's already old lah that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not what it's supposed to be tight what like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the uh the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this one capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical uh wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya lah that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia lah because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
uh recipients
eh but eh but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back yay belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house ah you watch the host ah hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
eh but the new season uh the other day I was uh randomly uh looking for right
and then I saw uh one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
um the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was ah what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this one this time round is this company aiya I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually uh watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this ah if not actually uh three D innovation is good leh
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
uh what do you call that low income families eh
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them ah because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget lah maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what ah you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper lah okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back uh
oh we didn't even say anything but he himself say that uh we we call
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years eh the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the uh what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that one
uh wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman seh to install our this one the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only lah that one okay lah but even so uh remember the
the also not proper
hollow eh
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask what we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
uh and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to hafari right
then ah then after that mm
either that or he know that he never do correctly lah he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable what right because ya it's a expensive tile
mm
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope lah we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet uh already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
they give us a quote at least we know uh like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the uh is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
hopefully that one will reduce the cost ah cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist uh off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have ah that one already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
ah
ah package ya two standard
mm
mm
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
oh double
ah
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if uh whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same uh the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need uh
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own uh contractor for the vinyl right
ah when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
ah
ya it is the newest click function that one right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own one but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
ha
ah
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in uh kids room
oh
ya
eh mm
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company uh he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give what remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
mm
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that one cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know uh overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that one also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is uh I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean eh you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
hmm
vinyl
mm
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this one remember this one got two option we this one is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move one without lesser groove
ya
maybe that one cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser ah grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
mm
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop uh water sucking mop what
that one that one you won't go into the groove
ya lah it suck water the mop suck water right
ah
okay water absorbing mop
oh
oh that one
that one very expensive that one is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but ah make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous eh that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old uh oh now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M one but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
huh difficult have what
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home one you go and find no
only that brush sial no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
ah
okay so uh actually oh I forgot to tell you I uh I sign up through Renopedia
and then um through there there will be contacting me ah like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even uh ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection lah so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us lah through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia what right
so is all go back to our own research ah
actually they say um doesn't mean the very the company eh very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the uh company but I must also research uh and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
ah hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then uh also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then err
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go uh down and uh have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give lah
ya uh but I haven't show you then I I even I even uh wrote down their names the
uh
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
oh ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down what
mm
it must be a balance ah we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
ah to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house

mm eh so did you see the new Iphone eleven eh no Iphone twelve design
mm
yeah yeah they go back to the very old like I think it was a first gen
that's why it's like what's the point of creating the new tempered glass design then they say oh okay let's switch back
mm
ah okay yeah
yeah
there's no
but usually like most hotels you can just press the button beside your bedside what
oh okay oh yeah it was like how many years ago seh

then I go they change the plan then I feel bad what then it's like uh just go ahead lah without me
yeah
um yeah then but it's like I don't know if I mean your group of circle then you naturally gravitate to food that I cannot eat I think that is very alarming to me
then they were like never mind lah you just sit here first then after that we go somewhere else that you can eat then I like
mm
that's why ugh

that's why it's like if they didn't have a guide dog how do you tell if they are someone with disability
mm
yeah it's not like they cannot survive without help it's more of like
yeah
yeah it's sad lah because they if you were to compare our levels of convenience with them is very different
mm
yeah but I know their other senses will be heightened lah like if you cannot see maybe your hearing and your smell are stronger but it's not easy
yeah so I was like hmm I wish I was smart
yeah
yeah
forest fighting
oh my gosh

oh my gosh
yeah
it's like why why must have fire

eh you know him ah
boy
bro
I know that I'm short and I've always been short I've been the same height since I was eleven so do not rub salt on the wound
single
thirty six

okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber oh my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
oh my goodness then he was like uh then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself wah is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping oh my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling uh gacha for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn gacha so I can just earn back everything and pull more gacha
then another one they
he what ah he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market lah that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on gacha the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars lah at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
he's so hot like
um what ah
uh I was gonna say something but I forgot
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like uh an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no uh fifty thousand yen in is
okay lah six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money lah but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like huh that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot sia is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay lah my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd lah I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what ah
uh shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that one wah that one is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because eh he quite handsome and his power quite cool
ah I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey kong and he has never failed to turn up with every single eh this company lah this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver ah I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey kong in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on gacha he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey kong's the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title oh I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
ah uh did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that lah
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
oh ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before changsub enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing ah so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
you
like
discharged
huh serious
alhamdulillah I don't know if it's the right
term but
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing lah but
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
oh
oh serious
mmhmm
I can I I remember but I cannot remember ashraf
I think infantry is like the main
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is ah boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically lah but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
huh
heartbreak
oh
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
uh what's the one that the Ghibli one
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
damn scary
serious ah
bestnya
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying oh my god
when was that before the after war
suay
wah that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
ah okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
hiroshima
karma
wah I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how oh all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
the nuclear plant
huh
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow ah
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares what you will literally like stare like nobody's business
oh speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian aceh is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one lah
that's true
huh serious ah
then they said like
uh when they is the causeway open already
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
ugh
ugh
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then uh for all the people apparently
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot eh my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
I don't know lah it's just okay lah granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever lah it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
please lah if they
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
then the money shouldn't it be equal
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that it's not shahira is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really lah she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
oh
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism
ugh
I can't believe she's in uni already that's insane
makes sense though
bestnya
I also want to go overseas study
ugh my heart pain yesterday
you have to bid it's like imagine but like on steroids
my heart pain I was I was more sad about the fact that we wouldn't get to go uh university exchange because look at rifqi he's still so close with his two friends like eh I also want to be friends with a cute japanese boy okay
I'm sure like and not gonna lie if both of us had applied I'm pretty sure both of us would have been shoot in students
like not gonna lie like I don't normally don't have that much confident in confidence in my abilities but like
wah
twenty twenty man one more and I can't believe it's almost november already november december eh
and this sem okay lah given that our assignments are quite hands-on all that we're moving so fast

let's hope
I know I know I know

like
to the same person
ya
apparently if you do your wedding under the void deck now you only get two hours
ya two hours so she's like but no forget it
ya that's why she changed her mind lah so she did it at home
singapore flyer
really
she's only doing it cause her mother and father there
I think if I ever do get married
I want like I don't want a big wedding either but
let's say let's say hypothetically speaking ah
there is no way in hell that man will want a small wedding
ya because he has people like
overseas it's not just people here leh
really man my ex wanted a fucking big wedding sia and I'm like
I don't understand how some girls can have like twelve bridesmaids
I don't even have twelve friends
don't know what corporate bridesmaid keeper ran to like how are you even forking out money for like of people too right
right
kan
like how how do you even have twelve friends who are
supposingly like ya
like how I don't understand sial like I think about it ah I only got five friends I can count on and that's it the numbers stops there it doesn't grow I don't want new friends I don't care for it
speaking about friend
speaking about friends so did she talk to you again
I cannot be bothered she ah messaged me and she said uh

by six you have to pack up and leave you cannot stay later than six and then all the beach clubs close at like eight o'clock now apparently
ya so we got very lucky
kan
you lah busy
okay what's the date
but
it's like
mm
huh
ah

we can do twelve
ya twenty six too far cannot twelfth is perfect
ya twelve is perfect
I don't even know how you broke your phone that day you know I really don't
I wasn't even drunk that day I just don't get how you oh I think I know when
when you was getting at andre's lobby and you fell remember
your phone didn't fold in half lah the screen just crack lah
try we I should just wait so you mean she at home you get ahead you they they can repair or ability or or go with their iphone or cold air cool white apron sky then err I don't know last night eh I really don't know eh you give exists food opposite the airport who got a C is you know what
I don't know
I really don't know how you broke your phone I cannot like to this day sometimes I really like think about it tau I retraced you know like every single thing we did that day
not once did we see your phone come out eh
huh
you're not that troublesome to me ah
all you had was one glass sial
wake boarding
you know my swimming skills are so terrible
my swimming skills a very terrible
I will still be able to drown trust me
I think so ah you know when I went to phuket right then I wanted to go snorkeling very badly because I really like the sea I love the beach I love the sea I like being in water but cannot swim for nuts I can only swim if my feet can touch the ground serious then we went to I went to phuket right with my ex ah then
we book all snorkeling trip know going to island island hopping right so we went to like maya bay and all that then the first island was in the middle of the freaking sea leh
cry lah damn sad sia then andre tried to teach me swimming in his pool
I cannot take it why do you have hiccups now
are we allowed to like pause the recording
probably
eh I want to henna dye my brows also leh
I lazy sial want to draw
syed's gonna what
why
ya
mm
he don't know how to find job is it
huh
oh
the irony
the freaking irony
panels
mm
I think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment eh where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
wah I'll be great and that sia andre sure sia will be good at that
he always he always huh
I don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever I stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night I won't see because I will be sleeping also
wah snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three by three he will wake up
mmhmm I always I always cannot sleep like
early when I'm alone
huh
I don't know when I mean when I was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like I don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
I don't know how but I will wake up to him cuddling it's either I wake to him cuddling or I wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
he doesn't I mean he will cook lah once in a while but lately we've been buying err he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six
I don't know how I don't know where he'd
I don't know where he get the energy from sia he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause I always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because I will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon I'll come because you know I would not wake up in the morning
every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him lah whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
oh so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick ah just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know ah it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like oh he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making eh like it's pointless like I told andre because uh last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle lah so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me lah but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscious choices what anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be sia so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise ah
mm
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
syed better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar what and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself lah like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose lah but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve sia
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like oh um
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
mm same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there lah
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already what tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
on a saturday
but it sure is
upper joo chiat
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one what so I'm meeting at one
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts ah but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see ah I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
then he eat but it was really spicy for you ah
he eat but he's still white
so like white people kan standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
oh my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one what I mean if you are near the area then ya lah if not it'll be very troublesome for you what
wow I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope ah out of curiosity
when is syed's birthday
january what
oh my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini lah but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs what your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
wah
I'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and I I I will message them one know in like the last message I got was that ah oh it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
hmm
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
I can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if I travel with you I know I confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
aiyo
I'm so tired
yes and I still have like things to do after this I cannot go to sleep yet
well I'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then I'm going to pack my things and then I'm going to go out
my some of my underwear is there

okay ah ayuni how are you
okay uh so today what are we going to talk about
are you okay I think the first one is I saw is europe highlights for eleven days

germany france belgium and netherlands
ah went switzerland first then after that we the last stop is germany
capital germany
ah yes eh berlin
B E R N bern
yes fly back from bern correct
we go to switzerland means ah land zurich
mm
ya ya
very nice
that was like two weeks
ya
ya fourteen fourteen days or I think lesser maybe lesser because inshriah cannot take like
ya long leave
scottish
so you want to go to scotland right
mm
mm
maybe
yes but the thing is
ya lah you you have to follow tightly to their
to the schedule
okay so why do you want to go to
scotland
okay
so they project the country very well lah in that
interesting noraini
thank you for sharing with me
and
do you know what I see next
it's um a package eleven days and eight nights
and the heading is spectacular scandinavia
ya that was like
last year's planning
yes
ya sweden right eh no
no no I didn't go to
mm mm
yes
I flew to sweden first
ya
so from stockholm I stay a few nights there
explore the city
how fate brought you together
yes and and you know what what they put here
fish market
ulriken cable car it's the one that we took right ulriken and bryggen but bryggen is what is it the along the
coast
bryggen B R Y G G E N
I do
mm
ya
so here they said set off on an epic journey to the nordic countries where you will see the capitals of denmark sweden and norway so I recall that time the the guide right
ask us like what's the
what's um which countries
are in the scandinavian which countries are ya
navia
ya
which as finland
so it's actually denmark sweden and norway
these three are the scandinavian countries
uh
actually colours of the leaves
mm
wait but northern spain
so what are the country
okay
interesting
so he drives I mean
ya actually when that time during the road trip with I mean we engage the driver kan ya
yes
so we can consider chey
or the other alternative
but like what
the not so
but that time you went you oh you went london only
it's okay
oh yes
but eh err portugal is
who ah the
iffah iffah's choice right
is it
ya
she's getting married leh she go with the husband lah
ya
but portugal ya
hais when can we travel ah
uh exact date I'm not sure but I know it's
february um coincides I think with chinese new year
yes
so when is chinese new year
I don't know leh
no I think should be
I think err mid eh
should be mid right
ya I think so
who who getting married
but all in like um
you shouldn't have made that statement
yes I'm from griffiths primary school
come on
ah I don't
maybe if I see the face I can somehow recall lah but
seems familiar
from griffiths primary ah thirty years old also
I need I need to open my primary school year I don't know whether year book or
mm okay
so then the like like you ask like part of the questions you you guys ask is like what's what primary school you are from like how you all know
ya lah griffiths uh primary is the one next to my place ah
ah
no no ya now renamed to angsana
ya
but is it ya the enrolment
angsana griffiths I mean that location is always very low as compared to
ya the other two schools
because they are better schools I guess
ya
maybe like past years like
I don't know maybe or or the teachers there are better I don't know
tiger parents
tiger parent
yes
ah speaking of which
ah
ah
then err
ya
okay lah
ya
so anyway like that ah so I don't know what's the arrangement for her
oh how much is your battery percentage
are you sure
if it's red then you need to quickly get your charger
woohoo
wah
so the kid
but he's not present lah for that two months or he's still orh
orh
ya
but is he like going to like another
school
nearer lah in that sense
yes I think you should maybe it's going to be it definitely it will be better lah because the only considered like the
the trouble is is him right
very good inclusivity
but ya
ya
mm
ya
I think as long as it's kids
you deal with ya
ya
uh ya
oh
ah
ya it's like like you can actually at towards the end of the year the school will actually send us like a form so we can kind of like indicate uh like what's our preference like what subject we prefer to teach
I think I think the head of departments and also I think should be the the principals ah
ya uh head of departments usually they have lesser teaching periods
yes they do teach ya but lesser because they are holding a
leadership role right so theirs it's more like like like helming the
ya
like timetable before it's like one day is only like
maybe three four periods
ya
then the rest all like I don't know lah what they do
you know settle some like don't know lah some urgent stuff
what they will do like they will be tagged for relief teaching eh
ya
I think like can earn up to five
ya
because like normal teachers
orh ah
I think err
normal teachers like around three K four K
depends on again ya because I've seen a payslip before did I told you
ya because like like we our printer at work is like eh I mean my previous school lah
it's a common printer
so and then is like because my current school the printer works as such that you send a printing job then there's a common printer you key in your password and then you will see what's your printing job then you print
ah
ah
mm mm
mm mm
so so what's the ranking actually for for early childhood like
like
teacher
mm
so I mean like there's
wow so deep sia
where you at what you at what you're at now
yes
ah
okay
ah ah
so priority according to priority
okay name me three
aww
inshallah
okay
no
so it's like practically
so
ya
mm
I think so I do not know maybe
no ah no
ya
ya why I look different
ya lah it has always been this ya but um
ya
but um
something that I need to tell you about this spectacle
no I didn't buy specs I buy something cheaper I buy super glue
so after that ya ya but eh I think is that one is reading glasses maybe
ya
eh it has this listing eh it will stick
orh
orh
orh
then then
hmm
eh that's the functional light right
you buy that all the way from
so the switch is there ah the one
ya
okay what nice what so when you sleep you will switch on that light
orh
ya ya ya I know
I know I sleep with you
huh
ah
huh
wait
orh yes yes yes
oh my god one
on a working day
then what time you woke up just now
then you should feel like
when you're surely
so you know they do it lah now
ya
ya
cause somehow when you're in that situation you know you have to do it you do it right
yes
orh
but because I think you got a lot of things already is it sometimes is the
orh
okay lah ya lah
but uni
ya
because that time I think uh
whether like um like
actually I don't think it's two I think it's three you know
ya
they do the editing and stuff is the third floor
ya
so ya lah
that's the thing
but I think I kind of know where's the new location at
ya I think there's a pool and there's a gym right
ya
so I think it's somewhere in the east side I think err central port
it's err geylang geylang
I think ah I think I may be wrong but I guess that's the location
ya maybe it's there or around the area
but I think it should be
east side
because he stays in the east
ya
east coast plan what east coast plan
ya
I think I think bedok area
eh
ya
mm mm
ya I was like aww
ya
orh
mm no no
ya this one is I think yesterday's story he was just like showing
ya around
I mean it's different lah different vibes lah chey
mm

wow
siala
young marriages eh
the first thing is the first thing in my mind is just divorce ya
oof
like child before marriage
mm
foolish this tough man like
okay wow wait I need to like plan this out like I need to do
okay young marriages eh okay I think
something like that ya is like you know err like people said you are so young like you know like obviously people judge right
but then is like you can ya we are married you know we are not dong anything wrong we are not ya they are not doing anything wrong what they are not doing anything wrong
divorce
oof
okay
okay
okay
okay
they want to get married like what by by by two years time in a year's time
but they
I think like getting married and having a family is two different things
ya so what are you what do you have in mind getting married or building up a family
then
at least like whatever you do right like people can't really like judge you that much because like you're not doing anything wrong ya you're not giving a bad image you're just young
you just look young
ya
ya
and I I I have a children that means we're not married ya
oof that is like
time eh I don't think
I don't know I don't
she again she started to you know go err around
and the fact that she told me at I was what eighteen at that point I was eighteen at that point she was twenty six then I was like wah
but ya
and I think she just started like schooling like eh no not I mean working at that school like maybe about one year or two years around that ya around that
tie tie want to tie tie a knot
ya babe but that's you ah like everyone is different also what
okay to me I would say like
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot or not
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot
ah
mm
what ya money wise but go back to that question that you said in papers you can be managed with through papers what then after that then you can build up your life what financially
why
mmhmm
mm
they just sign papers they just get married they think like they're the one you know like each other soul mates sign then
mm
ya
for generation I think like I think it depends on the society ah
so it's like
yes correct workaholics that's the word
mm
mm
mm
mm
that that's what I feel because of like where we live the society that we live in that like that's how we live that's how it is
that's how we grew up like we need money if no money we die
ya
honestly I I don't think singapore only ah I think it's just right now everywhere okay fine maybe

side business is bake cookies okay what is so do you consider that is a second job or is that just a like but then you said already said is really say side hustle
but also time and effort way to do that effort sia because you do that as a second job
so
so
what do is the good I don't see any good in working into two jobs more income I don't think so
I don't eh I don't really think that sia serious
okay ah let's say you work five days a week okay you work office hours then you have second jobs maybe let's say a part time ah ya part time second job second job is a part time
then maybe you need to work four days a week
then you have to commit one weekend so so in a way actually you are working six days a week less time for your family also sia
I mean obviously no family no problem ah if you have a what
for you
because okay I ask you time or money

hi
my name is Intan and this is weird
later on like the when the government give like the government um announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give uh you
okay well
well as you know lah kan I came back in January as in like I think by the time it was mid January um there were already like
if I'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially I think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of January I think that was when the report uh Singapore reported their first case
like we didn't care so err after that when err Jan no actually when February rolled by we had a bigger trip
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but err my my boyfriend was like the most kiasu of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most kiasu and he was very irritating
and then is like he just insist ah right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around Japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know Tokyo is near
Yokohama no is it is it near I mean like err there there are lots
of like I mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in Tokyo lah so
err we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like err luckily we came back right before when err Singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other and um and whatever
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
ya but I didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
so I can balance I can juggle my life with err studies I can keep my time occupied eh and like you know just do my stuff
okay I mean I feel bad for laughing at her because I kind of know her lah but as in like the fact is that like stupid sia you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible
oh my god stereotype sia
that's another unwanted
then after that she was like err even at times at times we we I suggest lah okay I say nevermind lah mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
Grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so I guess if even until now also
they should be acknowledged as well I feel
ya
it's true like you know I as in I'm not sure if you watched the the National day segment I mean like I only watched it for like a few hours
I won't say personalities like they I mean they picked err they they featured some characters like you know um everyday Singaporeans and everything
um like I think one of them was about like uh a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to uh the needy lah basically and uh you know they they feature all these individuals but
if I'm not mistaken or maybe you know I did not watch the whole thing but they did not err feature
food deliverer uh like you know food delivery people riders
so I mean they they they they how to say they lauded like um healthcare workers which they should but I guess there are more people out there who deserve
err like you know like for example they they do a they did a feature on like the uh cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
that there was a there was a segment on that but I think there as in like maybe like
oh really
oh it wasn't cheap
mmhmm but I think that
I don't know as in like the I think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very I won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
um you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in I mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like um not considered
how do you say this I need to gather my thoughts cause it's like err very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that I put quite
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
eh what
but in order to in order to get
mm
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that Grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right I if I'm not mistaken like Grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
right school
so like school as usually I have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that um like
err the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading err um like how do you say the community cases in in in Singapore started increasing
err our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking lah like eh so how ah you think that next year ah no sorry next sem which is like in a month um
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
so so um
err we we were like somehow like quite happy that uh we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know Zoom
then err then we we tested out the Zoom err interface then it of like sucked lah because it's like you know Zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then err we had exams
what is that module I took I forgot oh uh it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
so basically we were stuck at home so err like the school has to think about something
for like all those four years I never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
so this open task err is like
a forty eight hour it opens like uh forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then err it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like err by one thirty on
let me see Saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two I think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on lah
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me ah I personally I rather do myself ah because I know I can do it
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a assignment so basically I had to do err
stuff hais like I prepared questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and I have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then I was like
usually it's twenty five marks and I spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours I cannot
deal but I finished it in like less
I did I did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why I went back to school anyways is not because I want I mean isn't that at some point in my life I want to lah as in like you know when I left
when I left err when I graduated from poly I did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
eh thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and I wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause I was so fucking playful ah sorry
I was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like I can't I don't think I could have like continued my studies then so I went out to work lah
I decided to go back to school to get that degree and oh my god the characters I have to deal with
is like is like
there have
I do not no I really
mmhmm
ugh I'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project I mean like whatever that I'm doing now is no different than what I was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when I was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive lah I really enjoyed my poly life even though I kind of like played around a lot
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up lah you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again I don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that I have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the err that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like I am more focus I guess I mean like you know like kids right
I totally get it lah okay like my my classmates ah my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
so because I know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides I have nothing better to do in my life kan
and
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
eh
I really I really salute them for that because I cannot do that
I
no man I like my sleep I enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay lah I I don't think my my err my lecturer's gonna hear this I'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
in the morning and then after that you are on I'm still on my bed and then I'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture uh eleven uh sorry in on Monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically I know from nine to nine thirty at least I can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that I have to turn on my mic and talk
and then huh
shut up ya anyway so I mean like I'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time err by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty I will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently I'm not the only one who does that lah so sometimes like and I I I mean like I am
for some reason like that class I made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on err in real life you know we haven't seen I haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
that
yes it is a word I think
I'm the complete opposite of you like I really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so I sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time I only ordered in food
four times ya but basically
ya
for free eh uh huh
mm
no because
no no no like like periodically right periodically um err Grab host like have this like err promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer um a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then oh no sorry the most recent one I think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
uh the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so err ya
and then err so isn't like basically is this was this uh service available on err Foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course lah because now everybody can go out already what
ya true but people cook
yup my boyfriend gets to stay at home for the next four months
ya no know you know Nurul is err Nurul has been working her butt off all through circuit breaker until now
ya
if Russia if Russia produced I mean if that vaccine claim by Russia is proven effective then maybe we have
we wait wait shorter lah there goes my Korea trip at the end of the year

I know I know
I know you tell your mum that our future house is gonna be a zoo
because your mum asked me about it

and then I said yes I know
and then I gave her the straight face and then she was a bit surprise
then I told her
I'm in on it
and then I said ya you mentioned the whole making a pond just to put your turtles in it
and then I did tell her I I wanted to have some chickens but you told me that chickens are not legal
why
but why chickens are not legal
but I see some people have some people have chicken you know
no you can have cats in just as long as they don't they are not terrorizing our neighbours
ya
ah ya lah
so
okay
but why are people asking us to adopt chickens
but I think that one is really now illegal
I think that one is really now very much illegal compared to chicken
I I want a lovebird
but
you wanna be a turtle breeder
I don't think any but I I think not I think I don't think anybody wants to keep turtles for a long time
because they take up a lot of space
they really take up a lot of space
yes
yes can you give me awhile I want turn off the aircon

because
I'm recording

hmm
hmm
you know hanis never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me eh
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want lah
too lazy to talk to her
hais
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how rina always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from sonya that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know hanisah
they have leadership this leadership program lah basically but like
um sofia and rina said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked hanisah how long are you bonded with the school lah and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her ah because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her lah the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in you know seven years more in and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only ah ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand ah like twenty two thousand I can understand lah but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already lah anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true what like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her lah I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with sufian and rina what like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare lah she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense what
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand eh
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know lah
I don't know at first she didn't tell me lah today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know lah is it
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say ah who knows rina she say this you know who knows rina have something planned for me like dude
even if rina has something planned for you rina is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different eh in and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss saba
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
and they never say anything all
I mean ya inform the parents ah but we don't want to show the footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the lah what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really I should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone I have it my phone because I saw the incident happened and then I told jay directly I say you go and check the you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know I told her then she really go and see lah and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like lah and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if I go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
I mean I mean I like to say
bad stuff
I don't know ah
and okay okay ya

and like almost a lot of washing machines are that height
that top height like cause it's pretty average my house washing machine
so that's why I did this research and I've been wanting to tell you so that's why I said I tell you about it
so so you have to consider it

no it's in my cupboard
but I really have it in my thing it's no scratch nothing it's still very good condition
right I can get money why not can put inside my savings
since I touch my saving I touch my savings
what
what
what
say

uh ah
I think
work from home
so everything is at home so
that's why lah I decided to actually go out to eat
oh I didn't know it's only twenty minute
cause I would think that it's like two hours
muay thai
is not going to be there all the time kan
wow
orh
it's very tiring lah
this is during my secondary school time
I quit choir
to join badminton
and then I was in the girl's team
ya and then um
I join competition
but do you that um I only
I didn't actually fight with anyone like you know be in a match
and I already secured myself second place
ya exactly
err hmm apparently it's possible lah
whoa
that's a very
defined goal
in your life
stand
one other days in this one is like what everyday
like do this
everyday or like just certain days
no it's not two K it's very little actually I think it's because
the funny part is kan
when I search for jobs they actually want
people with experiences even though it's a
let's let's say it's a intern job
the intern job also they want experiences I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find
a starting job to get all these experiences
in a good company
actually
what I look for in a job kan it's not just financial stability
but more of like
I want to be in a in a company that
err that actually appreciates you for what you do
nowadays
especially in start ups
they
just literally
if this
job or experience is worth it because you are doing bits and pieces of everything
that's why I like I'm finding a job that actually
values
like
their employees ah that's very hard for me to find
my god
can I say something
so kan
err I was hired
and I have
um like a
specialist diploma
err diploma girl
her job scope changed her from doing graphic design to digital marketing and you know what's worse
she is the head of my team you know when she is younger
and no experience and I've been in that company for six months
so I feel like shit you know like honestly because
like I have the qualities like honestly I'm doing really well like
teach the marketing
how to even do like a video thing you know like I cannot lah
and she's not hired for it but
she's getting paid more you know like I'm getting way lesser and she's
I don't know it's it's damn weird
she's twenty
ya
yes
that's true
let's let's not talk about this topic lah let's just uh move on because like I find
this type of uh topic kan like
it will never end
so what do you do now
like
what's your job scope
wait
so
you
telling me that
they don't really get
and then
like
while you're eating all these
how are they going to interact and then like
build on the social aspect
because I think the student care is there is to like
also like help them
not just academically lah
but more of like
mingling around with others
then if they can't do that then what will you do
this is going on
ya lah
so I guess they're trying to mould them into
being this type of
perfect person
but
because
ya like I said
how is
that gonna help them in a long run because
you will totally be affected by this and traumatised maybe
you know send me to student care
ya
you know
so
ah lah
my job scope
no lah just do bits and pieces of everything
ya lah
so
yesterday
wah
like she's having a lot of fun jer
very sweet lah I find
ya
actually
like
this christmas kan
anniversary
like literally on christmas
because ya he
he like
ask me out on christmas
like it's on a christmas
a bit a bit weird lah like
anniversary
orh
orh
we every month actually
celebrate the
like we literally go all out like we go eat expensive food
ya
huh
that is horrible actually
okay lah my boyfriend
okay okay jer lah
I think he's sweet
clingy
is the word for it
I think I'm the type
who
likes being clingy but I also have
to have the time alone
like to
to just get the energy back
I'm I'm
too used back then lah to be alone like being with friends
so when I was with him
when he was clingy I feel like
I'm being controlled
ya
ya that's true
I mean like
hopefully
ya
I agree with that everyone has their own timeline
so
like
how is
you and your family
actually
being the
eldest
you want to know why
they really like instill this list of
a list of responsibilities that I have to follow
then
like
they always me you have to lead
so like everything lah like academically wise
so that my brothers can
like follow the right path
ya and then my
brother's just came out
like
ya
and
like
ya it's it's
different lah like you can see
like as the years goes by my parents don't really care
about like
academic
like not as
how it used to be for me
wow
um you have to take
the scolding
like
just take it with a pinch of salt
like you are who you are so
ah
so sweet
uh huh
a sign lah actual
um
ya but then he ended up passing away
ya when I was young
so I think what you can do kan is
ah
mm
aduh
salad jer
the nutrition
nutrition site
is not there
then how are you going to make sure like the money that you spend on is worth
especially if you buy a lot at one go
ya
I think
it's a lot of work
like there's so many things you cannot juggle at one time
and for those who cannot multitask or or like
plan the days where a weeks well
confirm will have a hard time coping
I don't know anything about the twenty two curse
but then
I feel like
everything
it's not free lah
in the end
you have to work hard for it even if it's
small little things
even like let's say happiness within family
you have to work hard
to put in time effort even money
like sometimes I feel to have the happiness in family can have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family so really balance everything
sometime I feel
to have the happiness in family kan you have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family
so
really balance is everything
huh
bus stop
don't want to take responsible for him
that is
really cruel
but I think like
there must be some problems within the family
like rooted deep inside their family in order for this to happen
how you treat your parents is how you're teaching your your kids to treat you
I find that very
like
like when we grow old
like you know because my mum's
mother
so with my grandma on my mum side
I kind of
that we won't even know
so nowadays I've been trying to like
just some simple talks
and she's
she refuse to stay at home
like she's
she has
has she has been going out
like
literally like working studying all these kind of stuff
she's too used to walking out
so like
then she
because of corona then like
the
so she
like weekday she don't actually
but then she still go out
what the heck
like
your leg
actually I
seventy to eighty
around
eh I don't know how old
which ah
ya yes
ya she
like
you work your whole entire life
you know
and like not like
for her
I think um
then
scenery
you
you know what's funny
even
I find
like you know those bricks
I will take photos of those bricks
an err we like whoa
like I don't know I I think like
very simple
like
I don't even like
tea is not my thing
but then I I
keep thinking about it's like
oh ya the ferris wheel the houses
there's something that is
calling out to me
true lah
that's true
now that
economy
depends on them also
and I think
birth rate
we cannot do anything about it lah
I mean
I have seen
would this be something I would want
in the future
they look like
they're struggling
like
you look at these families
and then you like
they they really like
like
are they doing well
like
especially when you see them
in public
you wonder about their well being
is it weird that I think that way
but I think
you can see like they're
they're okay
like the kids are like happy and everything I think a a big happy family is
something
I would want in the future honestly
rely on
maid
I I think like
in the future right okay
the thing that is driving me to work hard kan
is that
I don't have in the future if I don't work work well
I can just get a maid
is that weird
like
so I've been living with a maid
so like if
I have that taken away from me
I don't know how to cook I don't how to clean
so if I have kids in the future
hopefully I can get into a university
I have been
financially
ya
ya
hopefully ah like
ya
actually I have
find all these like
but I do have a
plan in mind
maybe that's why I
you know took a break
I
I took like a one year break
before I start
working
you have to know
so
good thing that actually found something that I want to try out
in that area
ya
I also
that one year right
university
and then
I here waiting one more year to start on my degree
is that weird
that one year gap
like
put in effort to really go all out kan
I would have been so much happier
I do feel depressed when I think of it
and it makes me sad
I didn't know you took a one year break also
ya I thought you were studying or working
november jer pe you know
I
like literally
no
I bet you didn't know that
ya
my savings I used to have savings
yes
that's true
that's what I've been looking at
like to get my experiences and maybe use that as one of the factors to why they should
accept me to the university lah
wow
thank you
ya
that's the thing I don't know how to look at their courses
like I know what I want to do but I don't know like you know this
honours thing and then what minor
I hoping to get marketing
ya
ya lah
like
seriously
just because we have many experiences with different companies
like
okay like it also depends on the company they how they think
you have a lot of experiences
in that sense
you can help the company
the future company
in all these
areas
like maybe to improve you know
better
you know like I don't know like turn over rate
like lesser or something you know like
it's hard lah
to to know how does the hiring works
they are not okay with
is
categorised under job hoppers
so how are you supposed to be like a
graduate
with already experiences
like let's say they are looking for
did you see this advertisement job advertisement
they say they want someone in the twenties
but with like ten years of experience
ya that it was like going around in on the internet for awhile like
you expect to be like
ten plus like in your teens
and already start working or something
I have no idea
that's one of my wish
that's one of my wish lah in life like
I just want to have a job
that I'm happy to wake up to
I think
it's really hard to find
it's also depends on your mentality
how you have
like what's your outlook of life
which
is hard to change honestly
illegal
illegal movies I don't know lah no lah it's not illegal it's more of like they uploaded on internet let let's say I come upon to it you know
and then I'll be interested in it and then
you know I've I've watch all the
conjuring series
ya
no I don't
stranger things
it's good
like okay like in in my
in my
it's it's
they're kids
so they're cute
like
like what they do is like something we can
relate to
I think everything is nicer with someone else
it's okay you'll
god has
plans for you
confirm
I can see
I can foresee you being happy in the future lah
so
okay back
to stranger things
but
what
caught me caught my attention until like
at first okay I think they will start because of the hype
then you get the fun out of it because
you kind of have this friendship with them so like it's more of like
quit the game because
you have friends
to be there for you already
so like if you cut
the game out your life kan
you're cutting
ya
I
on my four
overcome
I
the younger one
youngest
invest
in a game
like like literally okay let's
you don't have to buy a four you can buy a switch
I think that's
the easier way that you save money
eventually if you were to play play nation all the time
the invest on
rely on dividends
actually I not so sure
okay lah

hello can you hear me well
hello can you hear me clearly
hello I can hear you can you
hello is it better now
ah alright that's great alright okay so ya how you
you just finished exams
how is it
how how how's your results
unexpectedly good ya ya ya ya same ah
I'm so thankful for that
I mean like ya ya I mean our I would say assessments though like I didn't expect to get bad marks
so ya
mmhmm
assignments
mmhmm hmm
mm mm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya ya like
ah
mmhmm mmhmm hmm
mmhmm true true true true true
I mean to me it's good in a way like um all the lessons are pre-recorded so like I mean in times like you are not really focus during the class or the period of that class you can always go back to um the recordings lah because like if we ya I mean like
ya but you you don't really get the quality of the teaching ah like ya as you said ah traditional traditional methods are the best ah
but then ya obviously but then I mean like what can we do right in the midst of this pandemic like aiya I appreciate lah they they still continue classes through online cause like some of our friends like
from like ya from different universities they don't even have like those online classes right ya
mm mm and ya I I mean
I really appreciate for the university swift updates and all lah like they really accommodate to the international students I mean like they have to since it's an it's international university
and all right ya lah I really appreciate that part ya
mmhmm I mean
okay it's really draining
err cause like the
ya then um like this time round it's like six hours and ya there's this one subject I mean the exam was like
for two days ah for forty eight hours ah so that was really crazy ah
I I couldn't sleep well I couldn't even eat well or like even rest lah because like I mean like each time you want to do like your own stuff or like
um
uh know
ya like
um hmm so they gave us forty hours to like do I mean uh I need to do videos presentation videos so I mean ya it's
it's very like um it's very and for the for the amount given ya but also for the amount given lah so it's really appropriate lah I would say reasonable reasonable timing
ya
ya mm
ya but then I mean like if if they were to shorten it I don't think I can finish in time ah
um ya ya ya cause like my my lecturer told us lah err beforehand she was like um ya for educational psychology ya you guys have an exception of like forty eight hours for the exams then we were like huh really forty eight hours then she she she was like
ah later you see the questions and you know why I give you forty eight hours
so ya so when I'm given the question then I was like
okay now I understood why
but ya I mean
ah I mean like I think she she I mean I I scored well so ya I'm good
there there were like um five sections ah five questions five five questions
no sorry uh five questions ah
can you hear me well
can you hear me well can you hear me
really now
now
now how about now
no difference eh wait eh let me see
hello

really ah but then if I take out this earpiece then
okay can you

ya they they they they ask us ah like um are you guys okay
um ya like um if you I mean you know some some wouldn't be okay with like having group assignment right
cause like due to I don't know maybe different time zones or such so they like give us like um options if you want to do like if you want to go for like individual err individual or like group assignment ah things like that lah so like they like I would say they cater and accommodate to us ah to our needs ah
but then ya she mentioned ah like cause ya cause the university asked them to do so
but then ya then there's there's this lecturer was like
oh they usually ask us to tell the students that it's
okay uh
I mean like to go lenient on them ah but then she she like somehow like rant to us ranted to us ah she was like but then they never
uh take care of their like the the the lecturers lah like cause they are also like going through new things right like to have like a full-fledged ah online classes is equally like very uh what difficult for them lah basically

ya
pearlista ah
oh okay
but I I I heard many people go for karva
I don't know what popular but okay
affordable ah
every time fully booked sia is it is it still is it still fully booked
oh
ya lah
ah
how come
serious ah
wah
ah ah
ah
oh
err
I I rather do myself
so
I I need to do my hair
oh
I don't know
uh huh
uh huh

mmhmm
what do you mean by not progressing
actually um
so like I want to make use of it
even though um the
the idea that no longer having money is kind of like scaring me a bit ah cause like
I don't know eh
mm
cause like honestly nowadays
started business
like microbusiness right solely because of
sometimes in your head you think you can do better
or like you can come up with something better cause nowadays
not saying that I have a lot of skills or what but then like ya it's just
something I sort of feel like ya
I saw
err
so like it's I feel like she shouldn't price it so high cause I have a feeling that's the same probably the same process
um
when I saw the TikTok I think it's
in a way it is err embroidery in a machine but then like I think maybe
she just has to like either type out the name or like design it a bit ya
actually I think there's a okay maybe there is a bit of difference
like
I think we both follow the same
I think we do lah we do follow the same account so whatever accounts we follow is
is is unique in their own way I like maybe like
ah necklaces or like earrings
oh ya ya ya
ya ya oh my god ya
mm
and by right I think actually if you cannot also you can actually
can glue right
but it's just it won't last long
is either they have to give up their style or they have to um
not give up but maybe like either alter themselves or like
ya
actually ya now that you mention it I I actually don't know how like how did
the like entire universe decide
that oh this would be this makes an S this makes an M this makes and L this makes and like
how because like I can
nots I mean I'm not really I would probably say that I am considered average
eh average lah ya and then like
don't have M L I don't know if they have M L but ya it's like that
mm mm so like I'm like
like what if like you on the
cause like it's not that it's not that thin like not really that hugging but then it's not exactly
I don't understand
orh
your bust
speaking of like
what's that call uh sustainable is it call sustainable fashion
ya sustainable fashion and thrifting and all that honestly
um I think people confuse that and thrift that and vintage a lot
and I really feel like people should educate themselves because
there's a difference and
I don't know how to I don't even know how to explain the difference cause like
but like you know how um
and not not to name any but Loop Garms and um
cause that time um actually
my boyfriend actually ask uh ask me uh send me this post by Loop Garms
ah chris chris jericho ya chris jericho the shirt
then ah he like he like it ah cause he really like ah
like he was saying like he likes it ah then like he's
he's too shy to ask so even though he he is like to be honest when I
but but I mean like I guess
some people might take that as
I don't know if they considered if people do consider Loop Garms or stuff like that
or whatever shop similar to that um as thrifting
is just like another man's
trash that you consider to be treasure you know what I mean right correct right ya
people see it as an investment
I mean there's still a lot of fans it's just that maybe like
I don't know like only certain people will still be able to see the value in it like
cause there will there will always be like this
ya but also like there'll always be this resurrection of
of people who suddenly fall in love with vintage and like
really want to like spot
so ya
ah
the whole oh okay
so cute
honestly I think
like you know you your comment about the fashion in in general the fashion industry I think
I think people I mean obviously we're trying
more lah like this I think
this generation is more aware and like willing to like
make certain changes but honestly it's been like years of
is
is been years of like um
it just it just happen we suddenly like care about it I guess or like we're less ignorant
like more aware of what we're using and what we're wearing and like whatever we're consuming also now we're more
um
I don't know we're just more conscious yes that's the word conscious
honestly it's ironic that
that the thing that was meant to um reduce um
I mean honestly I don't even understand how
that uh I mean I understand how it happened but also don't understand cause like obviously at the root
it's just that like other humans and like us like just
that and just I think we are just wasteful people
entitled I guess a part of it is entitled and also
ya era era ya so
um I think we just
too
everything is too convenient now
like we don't really see the value in that in that thing we don't really see like
uh how much was like
put into like making it
and stuff like that
honestly uh
what we talking about
okay I don't know how we got to this I think cause we started talking about sustainable fashion ya
but ya I think you know how you ask me like
I think maybe
for now you just try to
um I think that one once you done I guess you can
cause you sold it to her at a reasonable price uh honestly
I I also don't I mean is it she make her own tote bag or what like no no no I meant the tote bag itself you know the
she made herself
oh
okay but but I think mm
pricey lah in my opinion is not that pricey cause you set how much you want to pay
no as in I meant the promotion you know how you told me about that advertisement and all that ya all those ads
you set how long it was so like you can actually just have it for one day for like seven days
or like one month also can then you can also choose how much you want to
how much you want to pay
how much you want to pay per day so it can be like
five dollars six dollars seven dollars per day also can actually
ah cause
you can choose you you like I said you can choose how much do you want to pay per day also right then you can also like
choose who you aiming for cause you can choose like
uh
if I'm not wrong you can choose like based on interest so you can choose like crochet shopping and
bags fashion whatever lah like you can you can put that
under the interest so that you will so that the ads are targeted to the correct person
ah by right I think that it can
I think your posts can end up on there
overseas
ya
oh ya ya ya
you know the account gosh girl
ya I love
upcycle
orh
should we order together
lah
ya I know
but actually I kind of like those type of stores I kind of want to do something like that
honestly I think for honestly now that I think about it right if uh if I were
you or if like I have the
resources and I have the energy and the
motivation to do it myself I might actually
will you be interested then you see lah how many people would and all that like if it's a really popular design you should
probably consider bringing it back or something like that
ya cause like I think that's
that should be the goal of any
shop I guess cause like
cannot come up with anything new
a few back up or like a few
a few designs that you really
like know you can do it and then like it's not that complicated but it's still nice or stuff like that
so I don't know ah
honestly right ya
yes I can see that
actually I think
I mean honestly it's smart lah and also and also
you post about it like once on her story
you know what I mean and that's still a lot what
anyway the designs also so cute seh
will it last if there's no lining
actually I love uh that some some
so I think it's cute but ya
ya
I mean we're not encouraged to follow it even
honestly um
err
I really think I love the baggy look a lot then like I don't know ah I just want to do something creative not that I've the free time
but everytime I have free time
I don't understand why like I already have free time what I don't know why I'm not using it you know then like
I'm actually still thinking about it
but ya so like I actually kind of
to me it's not really that complicated
you know accounting actually I think
realise it's an important skill
because even though account accounting is kind of a
just a bit boring to me but then um
because um
okay uh
okay so I I took when I was in like secondary ya it was in secondary I didn't do well lah honestly but
but I still understand what it is lah
financial statement or whatever okay no ah
like
took my score because it was a bit low ya but but honestly
is not
it's not dreadful but then
it's honestly just very is desk job lah but you
ya
ya mm
um industries that will be fine in a
in this situation is banking accounting food
food obviously lah cause
maybe
ah yes education and then
ah ya delivery like
ya lah just logistics maybe and stuff like that like
but arts will always be affected
ya
is it wild rice or is it singapore repertory theatre
they have ah I think they holding a performance I don't know
really
I got the email for it mm
I was like do I why did I subscribe to
mm
hotel orh it's a production
is it popular or what
boring
boring jer
like I can't make you a man or whatever what's that line ah
something you are not ah okay yes
I think it is because like because
yes
it instead of it being like a
oh I'm really going to
put in like minorities in my show cause they deserve to be the main character
versus like oh I'm just going to cast this
like just to be there so that people don't say it's completely white or just completely
certain race or whatever I don't know
ah ya ya ya ya
jameela
ah yes yes yes
tahani
yes
ya
ya
I know you trying to think of for a show where
I don't know ah like
yes because
but I have a feeling that some people
mm
mia khalifa
but
everyone in the world knows her and has obviously seen parts of her that I'll I feel like she would rather not
and she was also forced to do it also you know what I mean that's why I honestly sympathise with her on that lah
ya
it's not a lot lah actually but
I don't know ah
but
I mean ya lah
not all I will just say right now I just going to say right now even if I said all I don't mean all lah okay
but like not all but some
how do you think like that like how do you let yourself think like that cause I can look at a guy
and like I won't think like that you know what I mean
I I mean
I mean like I guess I get okay I understand
not trying to be like
fight back you know what I mean
like we are have always been perceived as
ah yes like weaker we like not the stronger um
species eh species gender sorry ya
like misogyny ya
okay
oh okay
mm yes
mm
ya
yes
arranged marriage
they don't have a lot of shows also
mm
ya

of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her ah
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
that guy ah then that eventually
um
living off from her wealth
was actually very very very
um
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama ah
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage ah because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
uh you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this uh phrase
ya
but
uh they got divorce but then
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
um
she like restrained herself
in this kind of thing again ah drama again
ya
mm
but then I heard that
I mean lah I don't know cause Syamsul Yusof has always been
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love what like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella
but they got back together
but he has a long list of crime record here in Malaysia I mean in Singapore kan
because I heard that he stole something and everything
but
I don't know lah how to say about him but I feel that he keeps on screwing things over and over and over again
oh wells

yes true
but then that's not the end right
ya
you don't even do that much
but they still revamped a lot right
ya
but
people private affairs seh
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
relationship I mean
ever since primary school secondary school and days
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex ah my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell um
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students seh but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that seh and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
so traditional
I don't know lah
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
huh it's not it it's not
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
master or what
no lah sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then oh ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
don't know
oh my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay lah whatever you young but never mind ah
but she cannot handle the team well seh
I remember she just graduated from and then she was
looking
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums seh
I remember so many people vomited ah
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what eh I remember she do the stupid like
err push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know ah
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
err the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports until
soccer right
eh
uh I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop seh
and like I I feel it's not normal
huh
like I'm really glad that we actually did sports last time
cause in some way or what
help to
discipline us and make us stronger ah
but actually it's quite bad seh it's like you're not healthy you know
ya
anyway what kind flowers do you like

it's like you can spend fifty dollars
for transport in just one or two weeks eh
ya that's right
ya they always go by distance
owe a vehicle
the cheapest is about sixty thousand eh
crazy eh you know sixty eight K in another country can buy
two three cars I think
uh I don't even think they have the
it's just the car
ya but then like other cars I see like two hundred thousand then got until one million all ah
then like even housing in singapore
is so expensive
then they said that maybe getting a condo
is better than getting a at this rate
cause of the facilities
and like condos kan
most of them the new ones are built near like
you got see uh is it Gueenstown or Redhill
the new condo right is directly opposite the
and it looks really good
ya
ya
it's small
but ya you win some you lose some
I think condos right the small small ones is like suitable for those that is like living alone or with just a partner you know
but if you have a family then maybe the executive condos or something ah if you're rich
in like the richer side of Singapore
it's like whoa living the K drama life seh
mmhmm
how many
hi
hello are you are you are you awake
yeah
cause you don't talk to me in malay
uh ex-supervisor
then like at first like I always very tired after
work then I will I sit beside him then I just dozed off
like I dozed off like daze off
then he say
err
I don't know maybe he
maybe
he just like ya
I don't know ah cause he say
uh what kind of question is that when I asked if he can speak malay
then he also like

then he say cause he don't want to disturb me then he say then he actually message me personally seh
he asked me to sleep well
I just keep quiet
like cause I very tired
ya
ya I know right

no serious okay maybe I'm not as bad as some people
you know her kan ya you know her she tried cooking
no and then you know her mum was like hospitalised for a week
serious
because
kita sebagai orang islam kan kita semua terrorist tu semua you know
ya even though I hate doing laundry so heavy but ya and then like uh you know in malaysia the the women's army actually wears hijab
ya
which I don't want to do lah I mean I don't know about you but just walking ten minutes in hijab is enough to make me sweat and imagine having to exercise in hijab wah I did that in year one because okay in my school we have this um thing where all year ones have to do sports it's called sports for life
so err I was in what was it called squash oh my god I love squash it's like tennis but you just hit the ball against the wall and you can actually go blind for it ya but then the thing is kan um
I I was wearing I was already wearing a hijab lah in year one and then dude the warm up exercise consist of us running around doing push-ups squats and all that
I felt like dying it was so hot cause like not only was I wearing a hijab so not only was my head and my neck covered up but I also had to wear the sleeve and then so inside I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and then outside I was wearing the sports for life uniform and then I was wearing socks and all that wah dude it was like
it wah I felt like I was dying in the desert sia serious
that was how hot it was and there was only two fans in the court and then I wasn't even there was so many of us so I wasn't even anywhere near the fan I don't even know how I survived that I should have just joined yoga or something
no lah cause actually the reason why I joined sports kan was cause uh it was super cool to me like can you imagine playing tennis or whatever against the wall you don't have to worry about looking at other people in the eyes but then uh I found out that usually squash like in pairs kan
you have to be careful cause you can actually hit your partner with the racket and then like um you have to wear the face face gear or something cause sometimes um the ball will hit against you like when it bounce against the wall kan
then like uh then my my coach was like scaring us about how this player he didn't pay attention to where the ball was going then it hit him in the eye then he turned blind then I was like shit why did I even join this no that and
one of my crush was actually in squash
ya so so like when I found out that he was in squash I was like oh my god we can play squash together so I joined lah but then we ended up being in different groups
so
and now he's with an older lady
so
kan kan I mean I don't remember but I think his new girlfriend is quite hot I guess so I guess I can see why he wanted to be with her but still like dude ugh
oh my god you know speaking of men I have one month like by the end of this month to find a guy
because
you remember diana

thing
ya so but but her boyfriend is a bit her boyfriend is like you know ahmad remember ahmad

actually you know um in poly kan back in poly I was asked out a couple of times by girls
ya apparently I give off a lesbian vibe
and then there was this girl who was
so into me she actually stalked me home serious serious I was so scared so everytime I want to go home my friends have to send me home cause she she would like take picture then she was like[eh oh my god we are in the train and and and I don't even know where she live at but I know it's nowhere near me

but she never really got the hint
so until that project ah that project was when she got angry with me cause um I told her cause during the entire period she didn't do anything

oh my god I really want to see how he looks like
oh my gosh you know kan speaking of guys do you remember ateeb

so the story of ateeb is a long one started back in sec one so in sec one um he confessed to me cause we were in the same clique
ateeb me jonathan zi qing and justin
there was this K-pop song that uses one four three means ya ya
ya so I wasn't interested in ateeb at all so err I told him like oh sorry man like you are a great friend and all but I don't think I can see you as anything more than a friend and then he he started spamming me so I just muted him like I felt bad for blocking him and we were in the same class and same clique
he spam
zi qing cause at that time zi qing was my best friend
cause like
ya he was spamming everyone and then uh afterwards I okay don't tell anyone okay
but I actually
had a crush on justin
no no serious I and and I don't know lah was I so excited when whenever I text him lah
and then he even asked me out but then apparently he like zi qing
so um at that time I had a crush on a senior then the senior made fun of me then I um tala found out you know you remember tala
ya so tala uh tala heard about it then tala was like eh D how can you go and confess to someone else when you are dating ateeb
and then but but apparently a lot of people really believe that I was dating ateeb dude that was the reason why none of my crushes accepted me because they thought I was dating ateeb and I was like two-timing
he um he saw me with my one of my friend her name is phyllis then he said eh phyllis damn cute sia can you intro me to her then I was like um I don't mind lah but as long as she accepts you then then and only then will I intro you to her
so err I ask
him to give me a his best picture then
ya so he sent me a picture uh if I can find the picture I'll send it to you then I showed it to her I showed it to all my friends like asking like eh if anyone's interested in this guy he's super rich
he's he's super rich yeah that's the only good part about him
ya and then after that mm err phyllis was like everyone actually they said that oh he looks quite cute from afar until they zoomed into his picture and his face then they're like
oh actually on second thought maybe not it was harsh but it was true I mean like would you date ateeb
you know what happened he found her account on tinder like she wasn't using it at that time lah cause she was dating someone else but then um afterwards
she she saw him and was like eh I know this guy so she just cause like she remembered him as my friend so she just match with him ah
then he started spamming her asking her to date him begging her to date him then she was like no no no no and she keep on saying no then after that she she got annoyed lah so she blocked him on tinder you know what did he did
no he went to my friends list he found her account he added her he her and then she she thought that at that time um phyllis and I were in the same clique so she thought that I was the one who gave him her account
then because of that right she got angry with me wah he he ruined a lot of potential for me man then after that he he spam her her her ah begging her to date him and all that then she block him also then afterwards um we weren't friends anymore like phyllis and me cause of him lah
and then he and then we just stopped talking and then in year two he texted me again like um it was a snapchat then I was like you know snap streaks were like super popular right then so I was like okay ah never mind it's just for snap streaks only what so I was like streaking with him
then like what makes you think that any girl would want you you know he he confessed to huda also
ya but huda rejected him also
dude I know I'm desperate but I'm not that desperate as to like know accept your money and then like date you you are not even sugar daddy material man
he was the one who led himself on
so in
kan maritime is like one end
no I I saw because they have a uniform pe
so I saw the uniform from afar then I I I was so scared cause like for a few days kan I keep on seeing like students from his school all of a sudden keep on coming to my school so I thought it was him then then err everytime I want to go anyway my friends will accompany me
ya and then he was in america like the ship was going around pe then his last stop was at america so he had to get back to singapore himself
then at that time it was already like period like cause we end on february fourteen then it was already like

she didn't even like him
I had a crush on justin at that time also

oh oh you have to give a number or like describe it in a way says that

like I don't know I feel like so fake ah really can get wish meh
but if I were really to think about it eh like on the spot hmm
my wish is
K lah I really want money ah so I don't have to stress about working or whatever shit
K lah since err just now I give you like a hard one I ask you for quantity kan
what is err
think ya I mean ah might as well go big right

an everlasting life to what err I wish to live a long life to eat food and not gain weight right
ya and you see so you can enjoy it
see you next time so you you got a wish uh guidance err person here so anything before you make a wish I think you can come to me

oops
K K K K next next what next
yeah
mm go back to the future what I wanna do ah
wah this one very deep seh question
mm
err can we like pass can we do a easier non deep question you know ah this one I really need to think sia need to recall need to dwell on the past
ya too much feels
um currently now I am err working
ya
healthcare swabber

uh huh
ah
hair tie and bag okay what on platforms like carousell
oh seller like those home based businesses
not like those mini one lah non non uh ACRA registered ah
ACRA ACRA
ya so if you own a business you need to start thinking about ACRA so ACRA is err let me tell you what it stands for ah it's accounting and corporate regulatory authority
ya so in it's a ministry whereby you need to you know all those income tax et cetera that kind I mean that is IRAS so this is ACRA ACRA is for business registration kind all those companies lah basically companies
ya but still err that's why they say unregistered home based businesses ah ha
ya and but are still unregistered you see so that kind lah so um ya I don't know this is like this grey those grey area kind apparently my start up is ACRA registered lah
ya
mmhmm mmhmm
I mean it's good lah so how is it doing so far
ah okay
okay so but so err haven't sell much at or haven't sell at all or
sell already
sell some already so is it doing well
so you just gonna do this
so sending out resumes already lah
okay I mean that's good that's a start wait so you're how old now just graduate in
walao still very young lah
what the hell twenty seven already ya
yup
ya but I'm stuck at uh twenty four
uh I mean like
I I
no I I'm really stuck at twenty four just that the facial hair growing at the age of twenty
no no I I I feel like err
no you you will you will understand once you age like like you feel like your age is fixed at a certain that one but the number just keeps increasing
nope you you you will you will you will soon
I am the last one
ya
oh you're the youngest also
okay and you're the youngest alright
yes because your wish is part of a superpower I actually want to ask like superpower itself because I wanna ask you so that because you have to ask me back lah ya so what superpowers do you want
uh apparently you already got that wish granted so now you're invisible
you already got you already got the power of dracula also and and uh okay uh the the the the food giving one eliminated
no you want to hear something new
ah
a teleportation
okay lah so just teleportation hmm okay good
in this era it would be
err
I mean assuming my wishes are granted then
err
wah ya like if I really were to think about something like in depth quite hard lah cause I I I want like I I want mind reading even though I can read people's err err
even though I can read people no even though I can read people I mean you might not know whether it's hundred percent true maybe it's just eighty percent
correctness but you want it to be like hundred percent right so mm mind reading maybe maybe not
err printing money apparently I already say if I don't have my wish granted yup I want that um teleportation sounds good also
mm but is it for one person or two person I don't know
your teleportation can teleport you only or like like you can hold people and like boom tele
ya ya ya
the err what do you call that night crawler ah
but night crawler need to imagine the place then you can go if you
uh so nightcrawlers one is limited ah err
woo seh
uh oh now ah um ah then suddenly
ah the red light district of singapore
oh now don't know I thought you say all okay imagine can just teleport only
ah oh I see oh now now you take back
yup I mean
whatever lah let's say my money dry up I just print some more lah
no lah not copy and paste ah just my hand like you know a deck of cards of money come out like that okay yup
the money is come out like that
can lah anytime you no need to get a genie lah my my superpower can lah give you some
today my treat
yup very convenient and easy
okay come next one I think I asked the second question already right superpower
so yup so that's my question so how about yours what you want to ask
no I I ask what I ask you superpower I ask err wish
you ask me what err what I do that one and
the I forgot what's the other one
I also I also short term memory
ah
ya it's the smallest err smallest more specialised err what you call that
I I don't know if I I don't know but it's very specialized all I can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it lah it's such a small community
um but the best part is ya I'm not I am not practising it lah
I don't want to practise it yup
I'm not practising as in you see now I'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so I mean because it's too mechanical like um I deal more with uh like all the machine machine instead of people
feel like I'm the I'm the cure for them
instead
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
in a in a way err the field lah I want to be is actually like err psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but I heard
you will have to go err what you call that err undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that lah and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
uh huh so that's what deterred me from what I wanna do lah unless I can print money right then I mean like
that's that's wasted on it let's just study
yup exactly money's a big freaking issue
err ya talking about it like very depressing already
like money lah like I I don't know now at this age I mean I feel like money never enough already sadly
um okay let me think of a question okay

oh I I got caught off guard
oh okay
ah that there's nothing much to me lah
okay let's uh let's see a random question ah

hi kira
what are you doing
I I ask what are you doing
ya I didn't know now I know at that time I was like
oh okay lah
have you how many times you had to use it so far
ah I used to have to eat a lot of um cough medicine but I didn't it didn't get like too bad that I had to go to clinic lah
mm
I did not know that I think at that time my my sinus was err developing my sinus allergy so actually one of my mm
symptoms when I'm like having an allergic reaction is that I have a throat I have phelgm
how do I what
mmhmm
ah
but I realised that I didn't react
uh nine months since I've been to the doctor
I should start uh
mm
tangkak
it's
uh is like one or two hours
ya
I think ah the nearest point nearest to this nearest to singapore
juice like the drink yes yes
at that time ah
ya and then
I think I think it's the same also because I grew up in um in a neighborhood that's mostly chinese
I think is it's gonna be the same
did you um see
ya
wrap wrap
wrap
and make it a sandwich
it's croissant
mm
because you took because you took french and now you know how it's pronounced correctly so it's err you wonder that I never wonder before you told me that it's pronounced croissant
I think is
croissant
why are you not eating
oh
are you going to cook or what
oh ya ya ya I know she's on medication also
can can
oh how old is she
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
seven or eight and then I sleep at twelve before I sleep I will just
ah ya
ah
mm
like
if she caught me
shower
to make sure that I properly err you know clean and moisturize
and then she always force me to eat um olive supplement olive extract actually is very good
mm mm mm
and then err I gave up you know what I did
mm
oh your your cough medication is too much
okay lah kan maybe
hmm
ah you need to take your time lah
mm have you have you done the portal
mm
you have any idea where you gonna do your internship
hmm hmm
hmm
do you know
other than aquaria or you know I did go to aquaria
mm
ah to go to work
mm
but
mm
kan
because because I think the people who are in power still are like our parent's age
ah ya
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
it's hard
mm actually actually
we would rent a place together ah
mm but don't know lah
you know a lot of anxiety regarding our internship because of how it is now
I think you just have to find the right one
wei you apply to a lot of places and then we see what they offer lah
oh ah
you know did I explain to you my new title
I'm doing the same concept but the water quality is
uh the data is from the paper that he published
yes
so
for my and I'm not sure for my introduction and my literature review should I find more or should I just use
ya
I also agree about the reading part
in a different way
mm so far so far my progress is very little
are we the same
are we the same
last sem
I think kan I think she knows uh means she learn from last sem
and then he said that um farid ask how we how did we do as a class
mm I think it's a bit it's a bit hard to do when you're not communicating face to face with your supervisor
mm
because especially because when you go through when you just discuss through text sometimes your tone doesn't get there
mm
no but you know lah how she is she's very like
she's she's encouraging
mm I think
the opposite
because sometimes sometimes you do have a questions that are like stupid
make sense mm
but you know some some lecturers like to laugh when we ask questions like that
make you feel like
hmm
did you hear about the girl
but my but they said that she's clear of drugs
mm
mm
imagine imagine the dad
mm
mm we just have to wait and see
mm
no if my mum is around I don't cook
mm
I do the after part
mm
I think my
excuse me
actually that's why that's why it
mm
hmm
ya
err ah best
ya wei
you know what I grew up on was um how I met your mother
you know have to break the rules
so my parents sometimes and they used to work both of them when we were kids so I think both of them they were like
exactly you just download the the book the E book
ya my my mom eh my parents have this friend
and then
oh no I'm so embarrassed
it's not any of the siblings is another sibling
that's like doesn't exist
I think because my brain doesn't really shut down
like I do get recurring dream
that I'm driving in my family's car like the estima
and I don't know how to drive
but I'm really
after I wake up
ya and then actually the the thing that I remember is the feeling of the dream
but I don't remember what the dream was about
that happens a lot to me
mm
for
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
what was your worst case scenario
you are in a group with who
oh
good news is we are in the same group
bad news is the other people in the group
are the last people I want to choose
ya
I don't remember but it's one of her group mates is okay like it's not bad

bye

eh how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so err intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic what two people ah and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
which is good
mm yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
mm
yes
wah that's that's okay too kan
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course lah once you are married you also want to have your own property too
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work lah for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though um
okay lah I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking wah I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating err calorie counting app lah I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it lah okay
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
oh
shoes I thought you like shoes
oh
eh but you will be more at the office part right
huh you have to also track just in case they need to run out
oh
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
the duty area
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons lah but the thing is
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily ah
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days oh okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job ah
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
err there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping one but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
oh okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
but okay lah I mean I found some recipes online so err chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff lah so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
no because I had to do some errands at home
oh where's her workplace oh area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
their shop is based in only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else ah yes can request ah
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with uh this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
yes lah all the effort
hello
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
what's that
oh
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
actually okay
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy lah to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
onigiri onigiri
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up oh just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
ah we wanted to eat sushi salmon mentaiko I think I'll just order that when we go to hei sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon mentaiko
I I feel like there's popular like poke bowls around area
yes bring me there
I think they open the orders weekly or biweekly
I think I let you try before lah the cuts I let you try before the say inadi with the rice inside and then like smoked salmon and mentaiko torched
let's go eat that tomorrow oh that snow beef bowl yes set meal for two
home based food or outside food
choose one

okay so the topics that we will be talking today ah it's um firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
for me ah I like science lah so maybe ten years in the future kan I would want to have
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and ah whatever there is lah so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also uh ten years time probably um I would like to
uh I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
focus on my uh
my computing whatsoever lah
yes
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe uh so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so mm
uh you were in your future house
and then um maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
mm
mind is stimulated ah
uh more to like action thriller
uh okay for for me uh I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you uh in-hand situations about uh about issues that could surface in the future lah uh technology areas or
something to think about
ya and and make you like oh it helps me to
solve problems easily and uh see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode eh
the reason why she was trapped is because um
uh her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting lah how they plan to uh get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then ah sometimes he can ah turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked lah cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end uh some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so uh he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and uh there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape lah so it was quite surprising interesting ah how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that eh hmm
if you can become an actor
uh what
hmm if you can become an actor eh and like any actor eh do you prefer uh do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
mm
I think I will
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is ah not getting cheaper these days
so I think uh focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases ah correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
I think
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be um how can mental health be um what's that addressed
and how can be um
how can we uh better improve our mental health area general
uh projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
very rigorous very very broad and very
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
uh rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given ah should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity ah
uh off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system ah like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
um
um how many one point two grams of uh phosphorus is needed to make uh I don't know cyanide or something
you can think of how to uh not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
okay so uh moving on maybe let's talk about
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever ah where would you want to go
and why
ya
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
oh when you were a little child
work studies stress ah
we play
mm
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
uh memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
um shape you and how you are today
ah
probably mm
I I think I would want to go to
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby uh in the european universe or the western part of the world
ah there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but uh there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
um ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and ah people were killed and people were died from um
um unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
uh the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know sina ah al jazali
uh mariam
abu sayde or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam lah I think it's very interesting to see
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
you ah
so apart from like
mm going back in time
um what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to uh have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to um to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal lah you particularly the elderly man take
the third one
ah
uh I think first lah I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
uh I wish
uh I wish that uh world hunger can be stopped lah cause
and they went in first world country
uh no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from uh camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad lah so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope ah nobody would go hungry lah in this world
and ah the second wish would be ah
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause uh we don't have the technology
because even from um the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
eh three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so um I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out um others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish uh actually uh I think I
I wish to have my own family one day inshallah
maybe next five ten years or so
really helps me to
uh have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me lah I really like to learn
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but um just hope to you know
um get married one day
okay so mm
so maybe uh cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
I eat right
I think uh I think
is not really essential lah but apparently
uh you want your friend or anything
how can I contribute better to the society
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
uh if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be uh be taught to the world
but um having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life lah
yup
respect
won't look down on you lah
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's um
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you lah that uh having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
flash
speed ah speed
inshallah
uh huh
I I like to teleport ah
ya
mmhmm
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
mmhmm
you know is is very easily easy lah I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like oh ah when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like um we have uh we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry um some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to um playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind lah that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
err is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation lah
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think uh uh this thing
trait between and humans probably uh they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have um
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
uh some uh some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
uh for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something lah something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
um especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be um probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
uh like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it lah
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting ah to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from um human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many um so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
very interesting
uh huh

ya I don't know why I've no idea lah so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
I mean we are going there lah but you have a recommendation where
mm
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
mm
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
mm or any of the malls around there lah
ya
how to say that frustrating like you said lah take out handphone take take the
mm
oh
that time mm ya
ya lah that one is
ah mothers' day tau I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
mm
that one I not too sure lah but you know they earn also not much
ya
err I think her mum lah her mum surely will will
uh oh
ya lah if you pay then I think cannot lah I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full lah I think if they full also it'll be
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya lor but if ya lah okay lah if you okay
famous
basic
three dollars lah then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that lah but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
mm mm
I think the rain was
oh
you stay there ya lah will damage all the property lah
they just guess maybe
ya
confirm lah
oh
mm
orh
ya lah ya lah but mm
mm
ya lah the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that lah
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
mm mm
ah
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
ya so how to prevent
ya
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya lah but
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high lah okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya I know ya
uh uh maybe ya
ya I think so
ya lah but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
not only the construction lah I think when the
so ya lah you can see that actually
ya lah some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya lah if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
kan nowadays mm
mm
true ya mm
ya once in awhile jer lah
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
ya lor but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay lah ya lah okay lah if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
most of the most of the business
true
ya
two to three hundred on transport food
mmhmm
whenever you on the fan lah you on your laptop cause usually
ya
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya lah but funny
a'ah
ya I mean like once in a while
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe err get people to stay home more
ya but not
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya lah like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
ya
ya
okay
ya lah
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the kan they do everything at around your what you call that
mmhmm
ya
postpone postpone next year
ya millions of people lah
okay lah but better lah like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
err can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing lah it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they err those india and china those populated countries who have like err haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
mm you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive what you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this err COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake lah ya suddenly ya cause I got
has
ya lah
mm ya right
right
so I think ya
true ya true
ya lah once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
ya
ya mm mm
ya that's what I mean lah ya
other countries other countries they locked down like
not bad what like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
mm
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
mm

philip is who the brother ah
public the public know

if you look at uncle choo uncle choo is harmless he maybe maybe has his problem but he doesn't disturb he doesn't cause a ruckus
he already she she has problems and yet she makes it other people's problems so I think that is that's a bit much already lah
oh ya ya ya ya ya
oh the helper
ya so that means you have to stay until sunday right to make correct ah it happened with you a few a few times what ya ya
or is it just or ya
real guy is err based on a real person

the thing about going out is spend money ah can ah but limit lor like can go out but err the limit spending lor cause there's there's a lot of expenses coming up so
but that's on top of your hospital stay all right ya you need to pay off your debts all
he's a he runs his own museum
are you eating it so are you hungry
I forget my my waffle is here
oh ya cyprus is in the mediterranean it's next to the it's err turkey and greece in between
that's why greece is known for the santorini right so cyprus is something like that
does turkey have beaches like this because it's right next to greece I'm assuming it has to
mm
ya so
it's a nice place I've read about it
the our master bedroom ya
mm what you want later I buy after this I buy
I you know I want I want the the err flashbacks right one says that time so ya you know you don't like to name you you maybe you will you not so impressed by the new version but I think it was good
like white mcwing eh no it's another mcwing is fresh mcflowers
chicken mccrispy ya um okay ya I can go north point later I will buy ya ya I can walk ah B I can walk there
I'm so desperate for that right I'm really going to walk there and come back

ya
eleven more minutes soon lah
what you want to eat after this

huh
so the you know that thing is called a segway right here where you don't need to walk you just drive so the owner apparently use err
use the segway and just drove off a cliff and died ironic right your own emergent killed him
I think segway is a very err lazy way like you can walk walk ah I mean unless you are like a a person who has difficulty with physical physical task if not just walk
no peacekeeper there these people the you can see
err cyprus ah the they are they are neighbours what
orh we went when we had the car right we rented the car over there ah ya ya ya we went inside before the inside with aisyah oh really
for good
oh
on weekdays a bit hard lah
mmhmm
putri ah
the son work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive eh and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's err very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them uh checklist err time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time lah
this is the the the obviously the border town but I think it's the same as greece their orthodox christian ya
what is your opinion on aldemir
is he is he a good guy a bad guy or just no opinion ah
I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very err it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king faisal the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
of what
what's on oh they watching or what
by who
the government
they're pragmatic lah ya ya
okay this is asking for trouble
he is lucky he didn't get shot eh honestly
ya obviously you gonna you gonna get
don't don't eff around man in in other people countries it's not right lah you
he's not gonna get in

hello hello
ideal vacation it would be
comfortable very casual very um spontaneous kind of ah trip I like that kind of ya I mean I I mean
for me it will be spring and when
I got a I got a
my cousin who went to korea before he said that ah it's super duper cold he went there during winter so so it's super duper cold so if you want to go there during winter better get prepared like
all the necessary staff for you to stay warm so I'm like ya it it's interesting ya for me but ya to your question it will be spring spring is my I think it'll be
tour guide in singapore I mean singapore got a lot of interesting and like places to go but if I were a tour guide I will bring them
it's very interesting question ah I'll bring them
to

I say there's a lot of places but I can't think err err
oh ya okay maybe ya ya maybe if you want to
ah I remember you know the masjid sultan area what do you what what what area is that ah

err kampung glam
five stones they have five stone ah they have five stones and they have like they have this handmade paper plane
and then they have another one with the handmade ah where you it's a paper ball where you need to blow on it and then in order for it to to expand then make into a round shape then you can just you know play it around like that
from what I heard from my friends like I'm more to like the old side of of like I mean ya I'm that I I give that kind of vibe to them lah like I I really like oh like old school style like you name it like for me like it's very very fun and interesting for me ah
happy family you mean yes
oh I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of uh you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends um she suggested me this one at at that point of time of the year ah the title was boys over flowers
it brings me back so much lah like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like ah
they I mean they have a lot lah but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
oh I like
we watch the same thing ya ah kitchen nightmares
oh those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's ah go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like wah like wah you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
err how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say lah
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like ah
like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
oh ya ya ya
movies
uh
oh movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one lah I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting what
eh it is so good I wish I wish uh I could you know get that that kind of uh if it was to exist in singapore lah or in anywhere like like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you

how ah you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good what
oof cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I I remember I had
tinky-winky is the purple one the first one with the red handbag

I mean kan it's important in everyday life what you need to eat to get your energy to get to start your day and everything so food
ya that's just a wish lah but ya money and health health of course health is very important for us lah as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all ah ya oh I have another question for you
ah
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
ya for me it will be err read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean ah you know
ah food it's always about food ah in the end it's always ah it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too lah what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
alright so how about ah
K got another question for you okay err
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya ah okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
exactly
interesting

what was ah the thing that I wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me I more to
so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
err oh I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found uh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya I agree I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful uh peaceful what do you call ah called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
starfruit
it was so interesting because I never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
ah ya yes
hobbies actually wah hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me lah
I I love to bake I think I I I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
so it's like when comes to ya I think my hobby is baking for now lah I try I like to venture out on a lot of stuff like I mean I vacant I used to like bake like ah I think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
I mean it depends on the person practising uh
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like ah
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever
stuff lah ya
of course yes
pop malay they call it ya how about you how about you
oh
I go with my sister I go with my sister uh to this to this to this concert um concert
eye-opening experience for me cause like you experience them singing live some more is like
they are the iconic band that people recognise all over the world like it's not only it's not only the singaporeans were there were a lot of ah other people from countries who came to singapore to just watch them westlife
so it's like it was really I remember it was really fun that day and some more it falls on my sister's birthday so ya how about you
I know it's always it always happen ya ya ya
oh it really happen in front of your eyes ah I know okay
I decided to not recently I think last year I decided to purchase a lot of accessories I'm in I'm I started to get interested in accessories so especially in earrings
you can say like err laces you know lace there there is one lace earring where you like
need to sew on it and you know you create and stuff so for me I'm more to like very simple and very casual nothing not so dramatic and all and of stuff ya I'm curious about yours how about you
brown ah brown red call it lah orange uh this kind of colours that I'm more to
love talking about love I suddenly so shy no lah kidding love at first sight
um
I'm not sure about love at first sight but I believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us lah but love at first sight
I kind of I mean not I kind of I used to I used to to you know look look at like eh oh my god like maybe I'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically uh ya very interesting how how what what do you think
oh I understand K K
oh my god okay
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got ah another question for you
uh oh you talk err oh okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
yes correct
I would oh wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our alamak this also very hard lah I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting ah country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that ah from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing I I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard lah to say but then I mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of err
different type aiya basically it's culture lah but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for for us
oh no uh huh
ya ya correct correct ya ya
oh no okay
oh
ya of course me too I won't I I I I myself also don't like to stay in one place I would like to know like safe is singapore lah like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only what what for we will go like eh let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place another place
ya talking about talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya ah what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore in singapore any places
oh of course of course
any sound eh
when you see sunflower for me lah for me I don't know about other people when I see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries I'm like how can they grow up so big like that I wish I could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country I mean but ya ya but the sad thing is that I'm not good at
gardening or planting I mean once I plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know I I ya
yes
if me I know I I I I heard stories that ah rose rose is hard
like I say if I can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course of course it give you ah much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it it give you more energy when looking at
make us forget about the busy life in this ah singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from ah from that side that busy lah that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these lah I also really agree with you on all this cause it's

wah hazirah seh
ya it's been so long since I heard from you and ah ah I'm doing just fin
three years and graduate already no
mine is like no exam or whatever just project after project and my course currently taking is visual communication but look at you now working full tim
so since you the graduate righ
I'm curious what full time job you currently doing no
that's so shag you know since this pandemic like what ever since march or something it's like affecting everything well we at home watching and just feeling like me myself but what to do right adult life and that's how you gonna face through out an
I think you can follow up like that too I gues
right degree lik
no matter what you take for example for diploma or something people will just look at higher certificate nowaday
and oh it sounds interesting though and I wish this COVID thing is over so it'll be much more easier for u
an
I think you can cope lah knowing you for so lon
and time management is the main key like I said before and you know this pandemic I'm having online class and my eyes degree keep increasin
s
and what's new right holiday we just sit at home no
can'
it's lesser things that we can do also now this COVID it's corrupting everythin
mm why not we go karaoke or something and talking about karaoke I kinda miss how we all use to g
like back in secondary school but if you want to go out also limit also five people so it's kind of hard lah cannot bring everyone with us well I'm currentl
in my semester break for like a mont
for example um maybe we can do like it's a a three star hote
you want to check the place out plus it looks like those kind o
korea hotel if I'm not wrong with double decker bed lah but don't have pool so I don't kno
maybe we can find something that affordable an
more fun chillax place lik
wah really that sounds nice since you've been to lyf hotel before so you roughly know how it's gonna be like but right you're right if we never get a hotel which come with a pool can just chill watc
like around town are
hmm but righ
I think we can just search mor
so that we know and plan out early where to go and suc
and yes I like water activit
and if I'm not wrong I think you got send me before the link like like there's kayaking swimming and all those fine things maybe why not we give it a go since like what seventy five dollar for vacation if not interested we can jus
go staycation just chill at the hotel jer and since I'm single and you've got a boyfriend I just nee
err my friend say it's not bad though it'
it's like a bali vibe someho
where you can just chil
without anyone disturbing yo
there's plenty of movies to watch for example mulan or something an
um new restaurant near marina bay and this taufik batisah
and many more that time I went um
um cafe hopping with one of our old friend with hidayu if you can remember her we wanted to try the taufik batisah cafe but end up it's like too many peopl
so we end up at this one random restaurant which call aline's cafe like a malay restaurant or somethin
but you know me I'm not a walking person s
I just end up at random place instead you remember about ayu righ
y
it's really shady honestly like it's only like the two of us in that caf
what to do you know me I'm like lazy walker everywhere I go I just grab or something I hate taking public for some reason cause I hate crowd
might as well bring the bring everyone is like so awkward only two of us are playing board board games
and ya maybe one day we can bring bring her along with us or just stay the two of us jer
and y
anywa
I want to say that um since you in a relationship you just have to listen to your partne
right don't really have the freedom to do whatever you wan
but I don't kno
how is it like to b
attached by someone and knowing you right I didn't expect you to be the first one to get attache
I don't know how you do it like so low key I'm so curious like how you know what I mean I'm everything I need to post like social media so it's hard for me to deal with tha
um but it's nice to know that you actually grown up and you know like wow the new hazirah take over the worl
but it's nice lah lik
I'm glad that we still talking until today and boys aside okay the important thing that is me and you need to have a staycation so you better tell me I still got like a few weeks left before I'm bac
same goes to yourself too and ya anyways you know my current job which is delifrance has been toxic so like two days ago I actually went to this interview wit
which I get to interview as a part o
feel so honoured to get to know and see these people like in reality with cause lik
right oh y
ya basically the liyana musfirah lady is is the creepy dude um
brother actually I don't know why he's so creepy I mean he is like wha
twenty five years old but talking to me like a child he's so freaky you kno
well beside him I don't wish to see his face like during meeting or whatever bu
most to most I won't be working with him lah
and ya mostly that basicall
the job is I only need to attend their meeting like what every monday five to seven
but when school reopen I don't know how to deal with that lah basically but I try to be ther
whatever it takes lah
the rest they just work from home so anything just whatsapp whatsapp whatsap

one year and nine months going to two years already can you imagine
can you imagine someone actually got fired because of this toxic manager of mine and ya nobody even likes he
god what to do kan
uh uh
well as a baker they mostly just intend to be inside right not outsid
leh then what's your problem for her not helping out right some more she not good at cashier also an
I find that like what the hell like bro like she been patient for you do you like lik
manager itself lah confront her like why why do you do this to my mother and al
then she still don't want to admit says she still blaming her like don't you have sympathy for someone or or somethin
so what to do kan people can't stay in a toxic environment foreve
wah gonna be like unmemorabl
they just don't look like tha
these people just working like what F&B and such don't mind paying seven dollar to them like they don't know the behind the scene on whatever happening seh but what to do kan it's time for me to like leave also it's been a good long year experienc
environment also like wha
err cutting to payout also they expect people not making sal
like no common sense ah seh I still couldn't the fact about the pregnant lady though what
to tha
but ya
twenty six years old this year and you know me neve
I mean it's weird lah you never meet this person for like for the first time what so a bit awkward for me bu

we take public okay we take public but y
wel
then I finish the interview for like what fifteen minute

I'm not putting any hopes or whatever lah I mean he is a good guy only you know me I'm very pick
so y
and he also got some work experience to go with s

why you need cert for that if you just gonna be a private tutor I don't I don't really see the need
need for that it's not really

you have to like
we have to have right I mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then uh
the wedding services
that one I that one I thought is just a
really ah that one I don't know sia
oh really ah
what how long already
you and your
oh
how how long have you guys been together
uh I don't think so
almost three years
mm
it's really you man
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much colourful I don't have a baby you know you know I think it'd be quite fun lah because I don't have to work and then
oh my god I'm the
polar opposite of you
because err my parents think that I'm a workaholic
and err ya cause I
ya but I prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there ah I I don't I don't really get much sleep I don't really do much but I I
I like being busy in that sense
um like I neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so I'm a I'm
quite a workaholic
ya I'm still twenty five also I don't feel the rush you know to
really get married I feel like even if I get married now it's because that
I don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd I don't like crowd I don't
uh huh
mm
ya lah I feel like
no I feel like I want to get
H we want to we should get first then
um you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get first then
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like I feel like it's quite crowded lah
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl ah then they expect a lot of you
female
get out ah
mm
mmhmm
are you will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you uh get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married
bigger house go there okay
zao zao
mm
a'ah
mm
well okay lah actually
oh
no for me my
my boyfriend's place is just um
just enough for his family ah I cannot really move into his place
so
no uh um
then what you feel what
oh
I think that's most likely you know
ya my
they move out I don't I don't hope for them to come over
no lah it's not like I don't like it's just
and I got
cats also and she's scared of cats
my
yes
she's very scared of cats though I I not sure how it's gonna turn out
hais
six people is too crowded already bro
I cannot
ya
I
but I really
how about no I should get rid of the person instead of my cats my cats has been longer okay
are staying longer at my place
but just two cats lah
but
some people have like six
seven cats you know
I saw that coming from a mile away
huh ya lah basically jurong
people are weird I understand I get that a lot
okay they always say jurong people are weird
I I have to admit ah because down here there's a lot of crime that
steal underwear kind
um okay cool I didn't know our area got a lot of
weird people
I
I like nowadays I don't
ya
ya
jurong shady ah jurong
especially the west side
country
there's a lot of uh there's not much of commercialised building it's more of uh
industrial building
so a lot of um
foreigners there lah
a lot of foreigners there that do not follow the law
in terms of police or anything
no no
I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know or vehicles
but
you will be scared lah because
uh all around us there are people
especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation um
those um touch and run away kind
thief you
when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house kan
I take I walk from pioneer
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home
like I feel that uh people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know uh
they even take he even took the same lift as me
uh
you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know lah
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the
the members and then the members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough
creepy
what
I
I would confront them but
I'm a very small person
more daring
you are more daring
ya
fight ah come ah fight ah
ya
ya ang mo kio
ya got industrial places what there
uh huh
ya I get you
if you know what it's always like that though
I would rather
tanjong pagar still not bad what
tanjong pagar still not bad I feel like around cause my
at city hall
around there
I cannot ah I just for me I feel I get
anxious over crowds
so I'm not a crowd person
I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so jurong staying at jurong west is quite fitting for me lah you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in jurong west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
okay lah I mean it depends lah
jurong east also considered area but then
what's that area called ah you know hua yi there I forgot what is it called but ya
there are areas where
it's not far it's not really far away from the
but it's also not close to any
no noises lah you know if you prefer that
ya
oh
ya
used as back up right now lah because of COVID
ya I feel you man I also got some savings that I thought like you know
err rent house somewhere near my office also
somewhere more accessible ah
no not at town at least like
maybe at most
east side ah cause east side I know
east and north side basically is
you got direct transport to town what
ya but my area my west like we have to
okay also direct transport but then
it's really long ah
and it gets crowded
at my area boon lay there you know so
I don't do I don't do again I don't do well with crowds ah eh
what to do
I just can't
what's that called your
currently your plan is what
to
ya like cause you were saying that
you prefer to get married right now right
oh
mmhmm
ah
eight years is a really long time
so
hopefully he will change his we it will because you got say before that he is madam

I I actually I
uh
with my current partner now
oh okay
your prime age
ya
but you have to think about the cost and everything
cause my
ya my my boyfriend is also uh
chinese but he's a italian chinese
he's more of the european side
so
I feel that there is a communication barrier between us lah but
uh
that was it's still okay lah it's manageable

uni ya cause we same we same course he's taking the same course and then we have similar interest which
which is uh gaming

whoa oi
hmm right
okay so
we went to walk around bugis
but
ya then um
then cause I saw innisfree right then I had to buy my facial wash so I was like eh can we go innisfree then he was like okay can can then cause when we were talking um we were chatting on telegram
he we kept finding like that we kept finding out that we had a lot of
similar stuff and
not common interest it's like
we do some
similar stuff then we also buy similar stuff
all of that
stuff
so we were like creeped out
so he asked me
what
so what kind of facial wash do you buy then I say
the bija one then he was like
alamak we have to stop buying doing the same stuff then I was like
I already bought it first so
yes
ya cute cute don't even didn't even work out
ah
when was it it was like in
I think july okay wait we went out like second july I remember the date
ya then I mean I'm not gonna blame his friend's death lah but like it went downhill from there
so cannot really say much
then
I'm not
as cheerful as you were you know
like
I give him space to like mourn his friend's death and stuff but
at some point it's
just too much I guess
when I'm
but you know how I am right
eh are you okay like are we okay that kind of stuff but like at this
I understand and I don't want to push him too much but like
meh
there was no closure honestly
he ghosted me
no it's okay
then he ghost me I'm like bro
ya
kind of like told me some stuff that make me like feel better a little bit but he didn't he just like blue tick me and went away so I don't know what to do I mean I am getting over him ah but
I mean
but he's such a good guy though
no I'm not
full of crank
honestly I think so
but
no I don't want
if he is
I will just say that um
friends
thumbs up and a heart
friend zone
input
ya it's a difficult situation
that's why okay that's why when I you know me I always confront stuff pe I feel like
that should like at least show him that I care about him what but I actually do care about him is just that
at some point I feel like
trying too hard I guess
cause I okay I I I like check up on him like every two days then he will always reply like he will always give late replies but like at least he reply
hmm
no cause okay the thing is when we started first started talking right he always reply me very fast maybe cause it's period ah but eh
fast replies mm
so but
all this pain
not worth it I guess
you see we just been talking for what two three months
I don't think I don't
ego
you know
unless unless like what
then he will chase me and
no
mm
now also I'm not looking also
men are trash
why are we made to be straight when allah create men like this
okay philosophy
ya I do
how about you did you get some boy action
kind of
okay
oo
oh and oh no
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay got it
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
wait
is it also in the instagram account I follow him
the third one
ah
how many instagram account you have sia
oh my god
oh okay okay
is he white
men
at all
I like how this time around you are okay
about all of these
um I got one
more news I mean
ya
but then like after I stop
talking to the guy I went out with a date with
on a date with
um
but it's not on whatsapp
it was on wechat when we first talk to each other then he's like I really want to talk to you then I was like bro
huh
so
I don't think they will get send back ah cause he supposed to be three years there this is his first year
so
no I didn't
wechat no blue tick
I deleted the chat
but
now I feel like I want to reply him cause okay it's not cause I have
I don't know probably happy that you got back together then why he why do you want to talk to me again like
why
I mean the thing is I can still talk to him as a friend but like overseas friend but I mean I won't I won't fall in love with him again bro
but
it's like I just want to know why you want to talk to me okay whatever the hell you done
but like at the same time I don't want to tell him to let him feel like I have been thinking about him
and like I have been what debating but I don't think men think until that kind of part you know cause men are like simple
when they overthink it's about it's not about this
overthink about something else
games

oh you think about sex
no one think about feelings
stupid
mm

what do
december will be like what one year since we met
he doesn't
I don't need long I don't need a long time to know him to know how he is
but the other guy yes cause I don't understand him
cause okay the thing is right if you if I confront you about something and then he straightaway was like oh I'm not perfect boyfriend material blah blah blah blah like he starts off
the
debate quotation mark debate
with that sentence in particular that means we are in a talking stage right
and then he

the the pain went away I was like wait oh okay
so I cried for nothing
how the heck
it's pain no cannot I don't want
ya
like I have this trick where you lie down flat on the ground with no pillow on your head then it's just like straight straight then it will hurt but it will flatten out your back cause of gravity
so
ya but I don't know didn't really work but
the yoga pose
oh
later can
but my back not pain anymore
inshaallah
retail
but I don't think that is that
um
as painful as that cause
knife
I got cut myself you know
the auntie literally was like eh be careful that one sharp ah you don't touch
I literally didn't even touch it I was just
it was just like
um
I didn't really put force you know it was just like a
a tap or something my palm tap the knife the blade
and then I get a damn cut
and there was so much blood and the auntie scold me
the auntie was like
no I didn't
I didn't
I didn't hold
but ya
it was painful
but I'm not scared of cuts lah but it's just like
subway subway
the place is really toxic the workplace is very toxic
I can don't tell you that it is toxic
wait what did you friend what did your friends didn't say
ya they do
okay it's not like reuse the bread lah it's like
they will just keep it in the bread um
what's that
the place where they store the bread
and then the next day breakfast if people order then we will use that
but but I mean cause we toast it right
we toast it before we serve so
it's
right
I mean
if it's mouldy we will not
sell the bread lah
but like for vegetable I can say that um cause I cut vegetables right
ah you know bell peppers
the top and the bottom actually have to cut it off but then um cause they say like sometimes cause uh not enough or something
we will cut that too
then we include it in the box in the container then we serve
customer that
the only thing I take is like lettuce and cucumber carrot but cucumber we cut ourselves lettuce no they come in bags vacuum packed
so I guess lettuce is fresh but
and the rest is also fresh lah cause
we always get
every time every time is production day
always we always have to order directly
the vegetables
so I guess it's quite fresh lah not bad
uh it's a small restaurant thai to go but
eh that one right the pay masyaallah
I mean the thing is right we only take orders serve customer uh maybe sometimes wash dishes and then we have to make sure that delivery orders are
like they order through online right so we we have we will get emails about the orders so you have to print the order give to the kitchen and the delivery rider
that's all it's not that it's not that um
complicated
why
orh
I mean I mess up a lot of times
so
like
but the way they key in the order is cool it's like
all on the computer
you know like how
restaurant key in orders is like there's a kiosk at the front right no it's inside the office
it's not even a kiosk it's a computer
it's not like that
ours is a computer
then the money all okay maybe it's just not a established restaurant ah but
it's cool
bro eight dollars per hour and like
the work is not even that stressful I can just sit there and do my shit know
cause so far away
it's at okay it's like now it's uh you know kembangan station
but I mean I can text her oh I can text her back and be like can I work
mm
I think you have to go interview
but I'm
I can go and work
but
um there's a straight bus from your house eight five four
I will I will also take eight five four but you have to walk a bit ah
ya
we get free lunch and dinner if you work that's why I like working there and the pay is way more than like
Subway
is
ya
I should have bargained bro
can like at least seven dollars lah sia
my back hurts from nothing for six fifty only but then
I guess six fifty is easy money
cause subway
I don't know how it was easy money ah cause every month I can get four hundred but they minus for also gang ten percent only
so
but that one is if I work like almost
almost everyday I work sia
four hundred
mm
if not it's like what one hundred two hundred
mm
that one the the um
four hours
and that one can get really
thirty six dollars
already
no cause we have quite a lot of admin also
I think ah I'm not sure how good they they grow or like did they even grow cause right
kind of hard
but
this everyone else is guy except for you
that's why it's a little bit scary for me
but they won't do anything
I hope
I mean
a mouse
you're a mouse
I mean
oh
no
then I'm not scared
ya I know
I was scared too
they were adults and when I was working that time I was like seventeen
and then like
bro sometimes they
wait the
okay so got
a few times I work closing so I have to make sure that
then the kitchen obviously the cooks will handle it right but then
I already put
the dishes like the customers ate from
at the back
so they have to wash it what but then never then I'm like
got rats
will come cockroaches will come
so I went to on the kitchen lights
it was like damn dark
outside
cause it was at night like nine and it but my father was outside ah cause he was waiting for me he pick me up always
if I work at night
so ya
then when I mop I on songs
so ya
that time I always did closing ah then my father always pick me up
ya
I'm the manager
ya
cause it's a small restaurant
then got everywhere
you take money people can see
then we have to ensure the float is like fifty hundred but um different cash or whatever then if the kitchen want to buy more eggs or whatever they need to tell me then I give the money then they have to give me the receipt then I have to keep in the float
it's actually not that hard
this sounds wrong this sounds like
stupid but I like to handle money
cash in eh
bro
eh but giordano okay or not

oh
you you said already toxic right
oh wow

out right on the
okay what the heck
it's okay my manager also
mm I feel like she always talk bad about me
ah subway manager
the ya
but I don't know where to work
if only they take in
youngsters
okay we are not really youngsters we're like
youth please
youth
I want to work in a library
no one will talk to you
no human interaction
shoot daggers
and but if you work
I know
twenty one
cause when you work in library you are under cisco
cisco is a police
and
I don't know I never check
cause library don't really
ask for workers mm
you should apply

and ask
there and be like can I apply
okay
that's a long time
but you can only work one week then after that school starts again
on second week of october
mine is sixteen
I don't know they never say anything
honestly okay the thing is right started way before school started
but they are still unprepared
and I hated that
no brain
you already know this is happening but you still didn't prepare and then
always got last minute changes then the students also panic ah sia
the one that's doing the work is the student not you you just don't want the
telling us oh you need to do this that that but the one that is doing the work is us
mmhmm
mm
one of my lecturers also like that
like okay cause
ya science
um
so it's more theory based
but the thing is she reads off the slides
in her lecture videos
and it's so annoying cause when she gives us test
or uh quizzes
even though it's open book you cannot find it in the notes
so how am I supposed to answer the questions
then later we fail you'll be like
then if she go through
isn't this in the notes
why don't you try reading your notes and referring back to your question and find the answer to your question even if you know the answer already there is no answer in the notes
ya but
do you know the feeling where like after you have done you are done with everything then you read again then you understand
that that always happen to me
but I'm not smart actually
I'm not
I just know my shit

okay you know what I'm just drill him drill eh
can meet together or not
can ah drink tea
drink tea on my patio patio patio
gape gap gap what
orh no lah he knows my family background what
no it's because he knows that I'm I'm pursuing my degree now and his academics is not
in par with me
in academic wise academic wise he's he's not there
what
how can he say how can he
think that when he's
because I think you know what
is it's ego lah you guys
the thing is about him right I don't think he has a real like really really correct like a real relationship before because right
the the the wait the ex the the ex the official ex that he was with before right cheated on him but then when I got to know how they are
during that relationship right I don't think it was
a real relationship I'm sorry lah but um
that was like during his teens lah like I think eighteen nineteen
ya that's why then after that
eighteen ya but then when I heard about the relationship right I don't think it's what
I would consider as a real relationship
I think some app
dating app
I don't know
okay so
eh wait is
is Muzmatch new
is Muzmatch new
I think so
ya
I mean I I never use before lah so I don't know
orh
fuck you okay
mm
are you talking about the girl or him
the girlfriend that cheated on him he met from Muzmatch
not really ah I mean she cheated on him after all how is that religious
because she's not over the ex before
she met hakim
like she was still friends with the ex which I think it was fucking stupid because
how can you be friends with an ex
I wouldn't say I mean we went out a few times before but we have never read as in I wouldn't I don't know okay fuck it lah you know what eh what with amin eh
I dated amin before but then now we always go out but with syafiq lah
really meh
even if even with syafiq even with syafiq
okay
once I tell once I
ya
what if what if err when I hang out wait when I hang out with syafiq and amin right because
err then I bring the guy
can ya then can what
orh
I mean ya lah I I get it but usually when I go out with syafiq
or amin right it's always both of them is not one even if
huh
me and amin no ah we are friends even though we dated each other
uh he's not
so how it ended with me and amin is that he was the one who ended it ya so
um he didn't say why but he told amin eh he told syafiq it's because like he feels that uh he's doing all the work and then I I
I am not reciprocating his efforts but I don't think it's it is that
but then I
I don't think I acted that way eh
amin now
back then ya I was fond of him that's why I'm still friends with him
why
syafiq
syafiq I've been friends with him for more than a decade already eh
ya I mean
ya
so even
no but if if if
but is when I go out wait when I go out right it's not only like individually what is both of them
how is that weird
alah rilek ah I still single what I still enjoying my time here
ya lah then fuck it lah lose lose ah
what mm
sorry
mm mm
mm
ya I mean with amin
with amin I I think there's a possibility that we will fall out because of our history but with syafiq I don't think so lah because we were friends like way way way way way way way
ya
with amin no lah
he knows eh that I I dating around all after him
he knows he knows all about the dates that I went
we friends already we friends what because we are friends you know why cause syafiq is our mutual friend
mm so wait ah
eh I make him laugh eh funny as shit man
mm
ya
syafiq which one
mm syafiq
mm
mm
mm
okay wait wait wait how did we get to amin ah
wait amin
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
okay lah I will try lah this monday when I meet him
mm
portrait the fuck
mm
ah
uh huh
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
aiya I I give people the benefit of doubt lah
so anyway um so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump lah I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this one ah this one I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
eh no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so um the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
she doesn't want that
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and um
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said lah what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
um
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ready to settle down I think lah almost there lah but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if if I think he really likes this girl lah but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
mm
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason ah
ya
uh I never ask for details
mm
you know when they first went out right
he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really ah I no one has no one has asked me
at all
orh ya
uh huh
uh huh
mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya but when he did that it wasn't with it wasn't with the Muzmatch girl it was with the primary school girl
ya

um so if you are an avenger what avenger will you be
and why
so
ya
is that your final answer
lock it in
um
I would want to be
um
I think I wanna be
iron man
it's boring but ya
because he's rich
and he has lots of gadgets
pretty cool
and he is cocky
but he's nice and cocky
I like him
ya like you know like if on netflix there's a lot of avengers movie I I just watch iron man one two three over and over again I don't know what's wrong
but ya
err
mmhmm
um got thor he's rich he owns the thunder
ya exactly
exactly
um ya um but ah you mentioned you don't like avengers what actually you like you like
superhero superhero
oo why why why
mmhmm
I watch all spiderman
but like toby maguire he's just so sad
ya he's always sad like
he's always sad like it's so hard to find him happy only towards the ending that also I find it sad
it's just naturally
it's like awkward when I when I look at him smiling
err ya
sad
ya
err ya um
any recent movies that you are in
mulan
cartoon
damn I didn't watch that
um binge any binge netflix
I know right
I love it man mm
um recently I'm more like I watch toughest prison in the world
interesting
mmhmm hmm
it's very interesting um norway
has the most luxurious oh my god
it's like it's better than my home
they have a supermarket in the prison I'm not kidding
legit they use card to pay and nobody steals literally like what you see here
like cabbage um milk chocolate everything
I know right I know like it's like I know um apparently they spend one point two
I would I would I would understand why like there will be like question arise through the taxpayers you know like cause all these are taxpayers money so the ya then err that the government grant like why are we spending so much on these criminals um but err
I I I think it's very
it's it's so humane and humane possible to reshape reform these people because their rate of like relapse it's a very low so like um like they managed to bring down the percentage to thirty percent
um of people bring the criminal back so that their whatever thing there but it's a bit too expensive though um ya I would maybe cut down a bit of budget and you know grant it to give to the poor people or whatever people who has lost their families during the criminal like murders or whatever ya maybe they're spending too much ah
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya true
until court orders they can detain for eight years ya that's so ya
like philippines is already so poor and you put these people forty years in prison
like you were just making their life a hell on earth
like like literally when I watch the documentary the the the narrator was like
was like saying um
err the philippines prisoners have seen hell on earth cause it's really it's overcrowded there's no facilities
vulgar ya maybe can um ya maybe don't show the norway one it's so nice
ya I mean
but ya of course not all they only pick the
different
because like err norway like norway spain sweden they all very big country so they not only have one prison they have a lot of prisons
ya so they only pick one like the highlight highlight one ya same ah philippines also very big so they only pick one highlight it's an interesting ya
mmhmm
kan
mmhmm hmm
mm
mmhmm
for black friday
no I just want to make sales I'm like I'm still thinking of mechanics
ya err
ah actually sells a lot of shit ya so she just opened a new shop the one that I share with you
ya ya ya repurpose those vintage whatever crap people will buy
um actually it has been going on for a while like actually like when I spoke
ah
um
ah they actually have a stamp at the back ya so she cover that
do the mechanics for ourselves ah to paste the thing and everything which I really want to try because because she said that she engaged um someone from japan to do this and her cost price is really high then I was like thinking maybe I should just do this for her lah then I just take commission from her you know what I mean because it's the same thing ah if I could offer slightly lower I earn and then she also can earn what
and she don't have to charge so high I feel like she charges too high like she sells a pendant for about hundred and fifty but to me it's not worth it for a pendant because number one it's not gold
ya mm it's stainless steel
it's just too expensive for me I cannot ya
a'ah
mmhmm mmhmm
so not planning
to use
mmhmm
Maxi Cash Maxi Cash
per gram tau
eh ya
ya I will scare like it go higher right
no no no no
no no no that's not the way you need to the see the amount of the gram need to be lower so like if it's fifty dollar it's worth to buy and then
when the gram go higher it's to do sell
no no no no no I mean you can sell now feel free
ya you earn a lot ya so it's a bit hard
ya mmhmm
but it's for business no
mmhmm mmhmm

he's a plant hoarder
no he just buy all plants and he grows inside his room
err ya ya so he buys all those
whatever crap
he's a legit err ya I am not surprised
it exotic plants my friend exotics ya so he and then he sells ah at a higher price that's his business he earns so much more than my lashes like he can earn about seven hundred dollars per day when he has the the the one ah the plant that people wants
since it's real
I know right
which is a
a lot of resales from Carousell
then he then he open a new

um
ya
mmhmm
he assumes that I was mad
ya
and then I I told him lah I want tom yum and then he was and he was like he was like trying to make conversation to break the silence and then ah and then I I wasn't feeling it I wasn't like you know chirpy about meeting him and everything I just wanna be on my own because I find my outfit has a small issue I don't know why it's such big issue to him and then uh then suddenly he want to be pissed at me he wanted to be pissed at me then he was like he was like

mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but he's suppose to follow up
he tell me to give him until monday I am fine but ya he's supposed to call me I mean he's not suppose to call me but he's suppose to counter ya because I told him I am going with ashley cause ashley meets
my budget and even though the multiplier is as not much as but it covers pretty much the same and for now it meets and then and also ashley said next year I can apply for full coverage if I don't have a relapse
record ya then I told him that then he said give him until give him until monday lah ya so I gave him until monday cause I don't I don't mind going to him but you know I need to think more myself cause at the end of day I am still taking the critical illness plan I don't mind I mean I won't want to support you if your budget supports me ya so I don't know what is he coming back with lah
but ya is generally expensive it's just more costly
like like uh if like ashley said if I have the same budget as what adam quoted me I could get more coverage with her ya so like I don't know what's the plus point of so I guess that what he is trying to find and can can get back to me
no no because I don't have surrender fees mine is just a basic coverage because I cannot afford surrender fees at this moment
ya so adam was supposed to
get back to me on that but he's not
no no no I

mm

more
err
mm
mm
mm ah ah
ya
mm
mm
mm mm mm
true true true
mm
orh
mm
ya
then
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
mm
but um aren't you glad its holiday now
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
huh serious
I don't know
oh gosh
mm
mm
mm okay okay
mm
I forward to the
ya
whose
oh okay
oh hundred dollars
mm
you can stack
wow
I don't know
I mean like if for hotel stay
what's that
oh
interesting mm
ya so cute
um I think she wants to feeling feeling genting
has it been an hour already
stop is gonna stop

it's a small group lah not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then um the place also okay lah not so busy last time used to be very busy but now um because of the COVID thing so companies send their
ah their staff
a participant they only allocate uh fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like err two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
oh I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the err
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
I don't know because the deal is um they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges lah
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
um the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge ah one que
and one and then myself doing um
but surprisingly all the participant came for
ah
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
mmhmm
ah she ah panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause uh every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and um
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
level
which is different lah this today's it's so much different from the past
ya
she's a bit timid lah I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister lah but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really lah
timid is different from people who is fierce shah timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
ya she went through all the assessment
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that uh these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but err she turned to me and tell me of like um
mm mm
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you um
cute lah but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no um
uh huh
uh huh
you didn't
mm
mm ya
mm
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
mm
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much ah maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
um
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
oo
uh sooner or later she she will forgot how to err right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the uh leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad lah mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
um
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
um
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
the because people don't go through
so it's gonna be the same
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put err into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got um cousin lah she could say ah eight boys ah the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be err medical attention given to her ah anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then err third she got um caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver mm they have
err nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know um half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday err maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so lah because she's already bedridden
um don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this um
that's that's what my opinion is lah
ya I know
mm
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this err dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya lah I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
oh eh you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
old generation lah
err
mmhmm
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
you know like like like specially our money ah nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
that's problem lah people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right err your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card err see see and then err this this lady said hey you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is err err giving some uh help fund because I really apply then is it oh you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true mm how to accommodate right
um
um
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious lah I think the more points of
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite um err
complex lah I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
um I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
um I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at err until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't uh take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
you mean you're not used to it that uh you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
ah sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
ah contribute no that's what I think lah
I I mean right now this is
uh right now right now right now at this situation that I um
at present ah most of my err friends
mm
oh you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
um ya
um how you want to err how you
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that oh it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
um
um ya true
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really ah really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand lah
um that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
you know so quickly the other
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
ah
now it's a time for them to take care of me
or as what you say lah don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
I have the capability lah
the
um mm um
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have err your energy level is our only that point of time eh is that much
and then you have feeling ah that ah you are human that you know that uh sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this
err emotional otherwise you're not human you are not robot it with you robot
mm
forever ya forever you be
ya
um ya true true
ya true
mm ya
breakdown
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
um um
somehow you were saying that family knows best lah
okay err family know best in terms of tackling one err let's say the mother lah because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming err since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
trial and error also
um ya true
um
so because chicken
oh complain and complain
mm oo mm mm
oo
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
um
mm ya
ya true ya true
so it would so when you have a when you have to take care of a dementia person you make sure that you always do uh a lot of research
research and research because dementia not only happen to our community our it happen to the world so every everyone in every everyone in
I should say the world world the global global it's a global err
phenomena is going to be as what they say pandemics you knows
ya correct ya true okay that's about all thank you

two so according to ministry of health uh we cannot have face to face interaction with um
the patients lah the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
so ya lah that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was um they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
ugh so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good um
so I mean there are different things that we
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined um
uh how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
you think so
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
oh that's very soon
ah so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff um and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families um with their expenses
next year lah next year when we can
so
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
um they bring in
ya
so
mm
mm mm
mm
okay okay okay now I understand
ah
mm
it's quite near ya ya ya
okay ya ya ya
mm
mm ya okay
mm
ah
ah ya ya ya ya
oh okay
for the adoption drive
okay okay okay ya
ya
okay ya
okay
okay
mm
newborn okay newborn cats jer lah
like for everything
mm
has a clinic
okay
mm mm
mm
so only only donations from from people from the public
wow
ah okay ya
mm
like uh
property development uh
mm
mm mm
so what does have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
that they know
all these uh animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but this is assuming that there are still jungles for them to go back into
mm
where are the pythons
no I don't know
mm
ya ya
no it's your skin
uh the wild boars but what happens to the all the snakes
hello this is art ah by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a um a a young and
really up and coming artist and
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
the lorries ya so there's
huh
uh
ah
oh okay
mm
mm okay
mm
mm
oh
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
oh I didn't know that
oh
who puts up these these signs
oh say
mm
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore uh even
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while um ya
it's just the regular birds the minahs the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
yes
mm mm
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens kan not like before
hmm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
like different kinds of otters
okay
what is that what fan club
this is this sounds too
they're so cute they really are very cute
the ones that went to serangoon road
uh ya
okay
mm
sausage sausage
mm
I didn't know about that
is do they like
ah okay
how do they
serangoon
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
oh okay
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
mm
snakes of course
um we had our chickens and
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
mm mm mm mm
okay that's new to me
mm mm
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves kan
ah
mm
mm
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
mm
ah
I remember this a few months ago was it a cobra or a python or something

how do I know if it's still recording is it still recording oh yes it is still recording
ya okay so anyway I eat my breakfast at
he took the power ranger mask and then I was sleeping so I didn't realise it
and when I open my eyes this is small dude was trying to put on the face mask was trying to put the power ranger mask on my face
like it's a bit not like bend fully but it's a bit like bendable so what happened was he actually took it and I think I didn't see I honestly don't know what happened but I think I assume that he actually bend it until it broke after it broke he just looked at me guess what face he made
ya I never even scold him and then
yup he cry and then I immediately sent him to the room terrible sia this boy
no he was about to so he was burying his face in the that one
he was burying his face in the pillow then eventually I check out check up on him and then he was actually like
falling asleep but he he didn't ah then by the time already I went out then after that he okay
why did I ask him to go out
eleven fifty was he late today
oh ya anyway did you read the have you printed the form
ya
ya actually by thursday we have to submit the form
ya but I only have two tupperware and like
ya that's true ah
how many minutes do we have to talk more
oh ya you know what happened
ya I think you can gossip here but okay you say you say what happened then since you don't like to talk so much what happened
so he actually vomitted at work and then they sent him home because it's like you know COVID measures and stuff like that
ya then after that no he had to go to doctor straight but I think he didn't or what ah cause the company just sent him home straight and then he kind of actually tell them ya exactly but the symptoms are silly ah as in like I'm vomitting
because my wife is pregnant alah whatever lah papa was a bit annoyed by it ah
is it really
ya that's true ah
that so mean
oh ya I don't know lah but anyway after that he came back home and then he kept
what colour
oh chey because ishan wants to learn malay oh
that he sent the a video is it
a photo oh ya what was I doing ah
can't remember was I was I doing
ya
you cannot say that these people can't hear eh can't see
so mean digging my nose
it is not a chore it is like
quite fun I mean we can finally we have finally have a reason to talk to each other for one hour
ya we have to wait for the aircon to come ya because we cannot on the fan that's quite sad this this rule kinda suck
ya cause if there's ya which means
oh dear
no I didn't
ya whatever lah
oh so married people cannot eat
soup
steamed
no mama already going out tomorrow papa is going to play golf in the day so I can he can fetch me in in the afternoon but I don't think so
keat hong
really
I don't know so how do actually people talk for good sixty minutes I'm sure it's not all content we're all just gossiping right now so
fifty minutes no I'm very pretty sure that it's supposed to be one hour
meet the fifty
ya lah okay lah
ya exactly actually my kids will actually talk more but then I don't think four years old can talk
papa why animal ya papa what animal starts with letter
oh yes that sounds like fun
oh anyway now I have a new game okay lah maybe you should be the one talking ah because you are actually falling asleep we have err like another fifty more minutes to it
feels like you are
talk about ariq he got a new bike her brother's bike also
a'ah a'ah
I said motorbike
I'm sure they all know everybody else's bike like thousand except for his
seven thousand
everybody wants to buy a bicycle now
I want a car
I don't care I still want a car
ya maybe whatever I just need a convenience of a car so used to having it at
ya that's true ah I think we will still keep the bike in the long run
ya but until you are old and grey
really
confirm
eh ya so disgusting so far
what what what do people do in the east ya but that's more travelling time so means longer time for you to come back home and go
ya but definitely double seh the timing
kan
ya definitely
ya inclusive of traffic light dude
like from the moment I step and ya that's true the walking is then fifteen twenty in the run that's not true walking is about thirty minutes
just now a'ah
then teacher amirah like say about the that's why I want to check
ya
next week but we supposed to submit the form by tomorrow which you forgot to print
ya I told you today
ya I just tell I just got to know today but usually they will issue a form
then can you acknowledge it online
because the form was sent online
cheap phone with no iphone is like the most straightforward phone
really
march oh ya ya ya march march
I know but the month is ya but the month is different
really
ya but still that's a month apart what it's not the same date what
I don't know ah let me think about it ah I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that ah which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home ah cause the home is a bundled family thing what
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
oh
singtel is so expensive
obviously not enough for you
ya but are you still like eligible for the data usage or is that
but with no sub charges ah
oh chey how sure are you
oh but you cannot change to singtel
same like ayim right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay lah
don't say that you don't know though
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya sia it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what oh you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course lah someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like uh
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish what
make the computer understand this language
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like
like what are your dreams what if you can
exactly these are conversation stoppers these are not conversation starters you know when
ya she's okay she stops vomitting she's very happy she wants two cake her
I like it though because it's not because she
I like it I like it that she knows what she wants
ira jer ah
that's not nice
I I don't want to put anymore ill thoughts on azmi
mm
he's going to what
oh I'm so afraid that he's gonna lose his job sia
he has his tendency of
where did you get this idea from
no don't be don't be bullshit that's not true my goal in life was never to be a housewife
alhamdulillah okay lah I don't think it's any girl's dream to be a housewife okay lah there are girls ira dream is to be a housewife
ya but alhamdulillah ya kind of I think so as in like we never thought that I will be the one who's gonna be a housewife but
not for long I plan to work soon so I am working now as we are speaking this is income
ya it is I mean some money is still money
my money is not off yours so hey that's not nice ya but whatever I can just transfer it back to me
no the example they give was repeating the same word like
ya okay then let's think of a topic okay let's think about what we can do to the house
oh really
stay in bunk stay in bunk
but stay in camp ah for one day eight to five
huh stay in
eh but not like meh like COVID meh why would they put you in camp if they are not gonna let you do anything
swab you have never done
how bad was it
papa abu has to take every week you know eh every week eh every two weeks
that's not true I have very small and cute nose
I think we have a lot of things to talk about
I have a lot of things to talk about and I need you to be the one who reply so then the the conversation ya lah that's true just trying to pull your leg the conversation has to be a bit of malay also
ya
no but I want to be a balance of both I want them to actually think we are so good
whatever dude
at the same time we have a lot of overlapping so we have to get that not so much ah
means when I speak you want to speak when you speak I want to speak
ya which means I keep interrupting you lah
which is not supposed to be what it's supposed to be understand
yes they are confirm going
yup uh better not come
that's so mean anyways I've already asked my dad for the car so
it's just that
ya and it's just that they open at twelve

one person has to talk at a time
no I'm just saying ya but I let you keep quiet then I interrupt
I'm in the middle of the conversation then you
then you tend to like murmur I we're not gonna do this here we're not gonna be fighting in the middle of a recording
there you actually waited that's just all I'm asking for you to do
I
ya
you know there's a red line which means you spoke too loud was it you or me ya
no because you went you won't see then it did it got shock
no just now when I read they say you if there's a red don't know what then it means your voice is a bit too loud
no lah obviously not void lah dude ya exactly I'll be so disappointed
ya that's not true
okay I'm sorry I will not interrupt you again
hater

it's okay
ya
of myself which is not reliable because I'm biased myself
ya that's true
of course not why would I do that that's just digging my own grave
we are doing this for money could you have some pity on us because this has been a lot of effort on our part
ya
no the crotchet to my phone
then it came off then what's the point
ya that's true ah and then are you gonna finish up the star wars
okay why don't we try one question
ah please the questions are quite fun okay um
I remember the question was mm if you had a superpower what would the superpower
what would you want as a superpower
I think I want to read people's mind do I really hmm
what would you want the superpower to be
ya
fly
that's not a superpower dude
because he's rich
ah
really such a
oh ya that's true technically iron man also no but he has that stupid heart thing that doesn't function oh is it oh that's his flaws
ah
I don't know actually if I have a superpower I think if I have a superpower I will travel back in time
dude mine is the most superpower among your rich rich is not a superpower
no
what
no who say you can buy people uh oh my god the person who's gonna vet this conversation is totally gonna judge you for saying that
your superpower you want to be rich and that you want to buy your wife what the hell is wrong with you
your wife
I'm not gonna let you buy me
with money
I don't fall in love with people because of money
actually mm I don't know what a superpower be
then another one more was
last
huh one week why
that's not one week that's just about three days
ya
ya then rizal got stabbed then what else happen
oh ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
err
ya exactly so which means ushu have to still like be in good terms with them what
rahman sia
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house what
that's very um vague ya
is there really circumstances like this
ya lah that's true ah
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it ah meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say eh I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
huh
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting ah as in like they bought themselves a resale
I don't know lah he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand lah could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know lah I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
mm ya
ya lah true
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the de la salle
five years of course ah he's like that what which is good ah I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around choa chu kang area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works sia
alhamdulillah
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
inshaallah no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block what
ya probably lah
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to but okay lah also not bad
can he go
ya lah that's true
inshaallah inshaallah
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to schools do they
ya like
ya but because it's catholic school what de la salle is a catholic school
so
oh ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else oh I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya lah that's true see how lah I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
eh dude
eh
what's wrong with that it's good what to be prepared
grubby like very I don't know he has a malay vibes

yes happy new year
ya true
uh huh
uh huh
yes
uh huh uh huh
ya the real world comes
okay
uh huh

oh
a'ah
oh interesting very interesting I see I see so berapa lama dah start
I see
mmhmm
I see so it's not just it's not just oh I forgot the date and I want to send it over I just send something it's not like that lah
I see so
healthy food what what is the what is the meaning of the healthy food what kind of food
so dia sendiri oh okay alright alright like like less carbs lah less carbs
konjac mee oh the one without calorie is it okay okay
err I've read about it once ya I know
maybe I should be your customer then
how okay you know talking about healthy food usually healthy food used to be very plain and dry and oh my god taste like medicine
mm mm
wow
ya ya ya but but but that's interesting because
why so many people didn't manage to do the resolution like losing weight or anything like like in my own case because all the healthy food oh my god
it's terrible
in that so all the best for the business hopefully you will be rich and I will be your first customer
and in some in some ways try to pay all the credit card debts and hopefully my own car loan and things like that so that's my goal I was thinking of I want to save more money err ya grow my own food so don't have to buy so many so so much food and pay the debt lah
a'ah
how is that
like for YouTube channel on planting food I see
uh huh
uh huh
oh interesting
ya kan so I'll be like
err healthy and rich
okay
okay
so that's the idea
mmhmm
okay alright
that's right
mmhmm
ya
mm ya ya
you you become a boring person lah
ya
mmhmm
I get give me some example on that
because you don't have the money at that time is it

you know the start up oh okay alright alright alright
so err who's your favourite character in that movie anyway
your favourite lah oh my god I think everyone is on his side anyway so
I would say that I I have been in business for quite some time and it has been hell but somehow I didn't regret any of it lah because everyday I woke up I know that that's something I want to do
I look forward to it and
ya that is something I really want to do
and start up start up makes me it reminds me to a lot that happened during my early years lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm ya
ya
business gives you more autonomy in some way
so at least you can do what you want
oh my god oh my god that that is interesting
I would say that
so I would say that
ya that's the beauty of it lah trying to hustle hustle and hustle until one day
you can enjoy the ripe durian
I also waiting for my durian to fall anyway ya

ya
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I see and I would say they are very good in emergency response kan I see
ya it's going to be very very difficult to most people lah
and ya
ya
yes yes most most business are barely surviving
mmhmm
mm mm
mmhmm
even though they are tech savvy mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
uh huh
wow
life goal lah
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
it's going to be a tough year but it's going to be interesting and fun lah
yes hopefully okay
mmhmm
err
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mm even the silly silly stuff lah
ya true true
ya
just leave the work behind and just connect as a humans lah as siblings as
daughters and son and all ya lah
mmhmm

yes
err I'm fine thank you
ya
um I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about um
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me um
ugh
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like err couple
ah redirected to me and then like I I I ask lah hi sir how may I help you
um and so err
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
at your you're risking yourself lah to exposure to virus so
no eating in the store at all you know
rude lah so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like um like we don't have a like um like we are like lower than them
correct ya so err
ya then the day before it was quite funny because um there was this err couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in hey but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then um ya so they were they came in and
err I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like hey why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like err she was like oh like I'm educated you know why you so rude I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
mmhmm
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time ah they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards um crane operators err tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
mm mm
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
mmhmm
wah that is late
mm
my alarm lah oh my god
you know that's a typical um an err reaction from old people the audience be like
your mum's friend
okay
mm
mm
mmhmm
correct
mm
aduh
mm mm
that is right
correct
mm
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
mm
mm
alhamdulillah
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share lah we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you lah as of now lah
ya because like I mean like for
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes lah like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like um I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it lah in terms of like
like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not um
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before lah like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like oh my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and um
um for me because um
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home lah which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of err
ya correct mm and then like
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
like you you figure your shit out lah
my mum know lah that he doesn't work lah
that's why she divorce him lah
you know
when I was in err primary one primary two
ya with that was like eight years old
I'm if I'm eight years old she's like twelve
ya so
ya ya
my brother one year younger so ya so
ya this quite long um
since I was in primary two ah I don't know eight years old um now I'm twenty nine so twenty one years old twenty one years ya but I mean
sorry
no lah she remarried and then um she divorced when I was in ya
mm
ya then like alhamdulillah like long time lah but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family lah and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said eh err I'm going to I'm going to the food court lah to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
I mean literally all he does at home is watch videos and um
and like he's working
sometimes I really like
like just err pray to god lah alhamdulillah my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know err one funny day err my youngest sister told me she's like
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
when I was working my full time job lah I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so um ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that lah
was to like maybe set up a mm maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him lah even though because at one time lah they wanted to divorce then we we advise them lah like as the older children we advise them to stay together lah if they if they can
why are we born in a poor family
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those err chinese people in society where they say oh I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
um on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
mm
ya so ya I mean I'm
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better lah or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
mm which one the the guy ah
ya that bastard
that is true
ya but like um so like you were schooled in singapore and then you school malaysia now so like err what do you feel like what's the difference in the school curriculum the total atmosphere
then you can talk to about it lah until the time is up ah
book smart lah
mm
mm
correct
mm
mmhmm
that's great
ya you can tell from
correct malaysian and singaporean you can tell how they talk and the way they dress our fashion style and our the way we articulate things is very different
mm
mm
mm
it is
mmhmm
ya it's so fast right your time like oh my god
mm
mm
mm
mm
correct because the thing is at in in
in all these places are where um a lot of tourists come so the rates down there are definitely higher things are definitely more expensive because they want to rake in all the foreigners' money because foreigners will be like oh I convert
of course
mm
ya because you you typically like you like other people also go to malaysia thinking about the exchange rate but you should never think about the exchange rate because you are spending in that currency per se
mm
oh
lol
and then you can can with friends to baby gear dealership
I would think that you will like that kind of girl
ya
ah of course knowing you you would have dressed up
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
ya is your acts right
mm
mm
correct
mm
that's great internship in singapore

I started at nineteen what
um after I was bored then I decided to sign up for all
then I said okay then nineteen years old I went to audition
I was doing backstage work
they need a dead body but actually that role right can just use a dummy you know actually can just use anything ah is just the thing doesn't move you know the dead body doesn't move
lie there then after that I say okay so um it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay lah my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
and um
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try lah two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
watching the show and then um second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like astaghfirullahalazim she was like

that post has influenced people to buy the programme also what okay we also don't know

okay
relax jer just just sound
no lah don't force it lah don't force it
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
alah that one
um
okay lah but
that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
ah
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing lah I want to grow up I want to become
um
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course lah that
um
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why eh oh I know why
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no lah no lah no lah it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got err theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful lah
and I wasn't doing very well in eh no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry eh no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
uh attended this lah you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
like that ah so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay lah give you more job ah then now I started learn
um
uh
like other skills lah like I've got to learn more about it
teaching then after now now I realised what is my purpose lah
mm
oh you went to watch that one ah ya it wasn't my first show lah but it was the first show that probably you watch
mmhmm
okay
mm mm
mm
ah ah
ya I mean I I love the show ah really I really help her but then
wah this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more uh but ya got big issue lah that one until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that like in a way I have to give advice lah it's really about you say lah your marketing
to win your audience um
the how whether they can the whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
mm then how you guys do it
mm
mm
let's try one of these prompts lah ha
mm
okay
okay
they always sell the masala chai in um
very tiny cups but I think is less than ten cents if you think about it in singapore dollar in dollars
the chai but in that cup the big cup huh can I I say ya ya ya
I I don't know I'm just addicted to tea lah so but I like ah masala chai ah you like tea right
um
chai basically is tea what
delivery alamak
okay
is it still continue it's not it's not uh okay
maybe
one food
and meets all so all the health requirements something like the vegetable
err
something with protein and carbs enough all
I mean if it's for survival
if your if your if I think about if you think is probably for survival lah but if I for indulgence
what would be the worst buy one get
huh what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
I just say for one is for one right buy one get one free
what would be the worst idea for that kind of sale
what about fringe
why would you need two fridge
buy one get one eh washing machine actually maybe one for whites one for coloured can make sense it can make sense
no lah but it's it's it's buy one get one free what
ah okay okay compare compare
okay okay okay
uh okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mm if you can
master three new skills what would they be
then
oh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
oh
on purpose
why ah
oh eh okay okay
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill uh I want uh
um
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will lah ah
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move ah
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie ah a fighting film ah
cool lah but mm
and I don't like to fight ah
ya but then no lah I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
eh you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no lah just uh uh uh generic
um a lot of the but uh just basic ones lah very introduction to all the different therapies lah
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
okay if you can like you said okay can lah you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay lah two weeks right
but some people they might say that
eh
dare to ask me we're not even that close um you know
you know
um
we take that example is not a very good example lah like one uh like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
um
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that lah but then
in the end um
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
so I'm learning about that ah so it's very uh and I err so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
you clothes around ah you know it made me feel uh like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel um
that
uh you feel lah
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that lah I
if you could pick up your own stuff
um
would you be doing it lah am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well lah okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay lah you ask me then I can say yes I can say no lah
ya it's like a demand kan to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how ah how to
balance that out I try to figure it out lah
ya but won't
mm
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
mm
mm
ya I see hard ah
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
um
but you are following your dreams kan
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know I just only last you kinda kinda nearby indonesia in canada africa you occurred under its eco guy causing like you do
so formal
who do you speak with usually
mm mm
that
that's not real lah it's not the code is not the what to say
mm mm
language
mm
mm mm
mm
oh no

counter fourteen is empty why is nobody there is it
alamak then you know my my senior was like
keep silent then I keep quiet I keep quiet because she's my senior mah so I keep quiet lah okay I keep quiet
then after that he say hello why nobody answering my question then me and my
me and my friend was like err then we just went back to the our back uh
ya ya we straight up ignored him because like we don't want to
how to say like make it more I don't know how to say the tension like you know
like build up the tension or what kan so we just
so we just waited until like someone call him the another counter to call him and serve him lah
ah actually confront him because I was almost on my like
like you know then I'm like ah ya lah that's what happened ah that's one of it ah
mm
ya they think they think they old they
they we they think we need to serve them and everything but actually there's more uh actually oh my god
will think that oh I wait for mm
hello ah um sorry I wait for one hour um
it is one hour the waiting time because it's a lot of patients not just you
correct right ya so ya some of them don't understand you know
ya lah which is which is expected lah but that's like one of the few incidents lah it's it's normal you know but like as someone who is a youngster
like to see a lot of err older people everyday
less younger people of the same age it's a bit like and they see you as a
kid ah then I can get my ways sometimes they're like that so sometimes we have to stand our ground lah ya so you know
singaporeans like very kiasu and very like you know
ha they wah new iphone new iphone ah they can what
so like I'm quite interested in like how you handle the like
your workplace ya like are they okay they're they're okay right
quite chill lah all okay lah okay lah
ya lah ya lah ya
smooth ah smooth ah gucci ah gucci
I don't know I I've been thinking about it cause like
me my course my course is mm media production and design kan
if I'm wrong lah so
mm like designer
like magazine magazine you know lah whatever lah ya so anything advertising really so
like publicity or whatever it's just that I need to find which also
like which company that I want to go to because I think I
I you know a lot of people now want experience you know so
I don't know I've been thinking about it lah like
like just stop like just stop and then like
basically our progress
of like uh err gaining skills like I don't know how to say like
to intern like ya
got got intern but my intern is
was in the healthcare side at so it is related to my course
for their events so like it's relevant but the
setting of work or the target audience is not really like
not not that it's not cup of tea it's a good experience
I want to be more fun more young but
at there I'm just stuck with the older audience again and it's more about
what works what works ya I but I
okay lah I do give them quite good things but I'm limited by the fact that it's
the target audience is older so some colour I can't use they'll be more sensitive some font size ya because
if and I feel like a lot of info is inside err like a hospital kan nothing there already
there's bound to be a lot of info lah words so having a lot of bigger fonts
extravagant you know seh I think so so I feel like if I were to be
at somewhere that is more
for for employers also to even hire people now because they lack of you know money to even you know have manpower so right now I don't think it's a very good time to find jobs that
damn sad ah ha we never graduate
exactly
exactly
ya
yes correct correct
can we do you know like because it's not even a good time to think about career at the moment because like your career right now
err they they're all lah whatever uh whatever um like you say food business you you study
cause cause you know a lot of people don't dine can't dine that much all takeaway so it's harder lah basically ya so right now
ya lah like moving forward like right now I don't know what to do lah I feel like I don't now how to say I feel like we shouldn't
err to be so fixated with
do not think so far because I feel like if you think so far you don't think that these kind of things will happen I feel like you should just plan at the things that is
ya lah kan so so I I
oh my god yes oh my god yes yes I feel like I've lost my youth
fun things to do but we can't actually do it because our like I don't know going concert or uh like
oh
you can say relationships are affected in the sense like that I feel lonely I feel lonely
want to see but the like last time the how to say the level of interaction that we have last time and now is so different it affects us
mentally lah ya and I've been seeing all those tweets and everything people are really sad and everything I think largely
is a factor because people don't get to meet people I think that's the most important thing lah like you know like entertainment wise
oh ya correct correct correct
ya
ya
ya
correct correct correct are you an extrovert
mm
mm
how how how
oh
can who say cannot ya I changed also I changed also from extroverted now I'm okay I'm actually no I'm always actually when I took the test
but now is more now since last time I'm ambivert kan but now is more introverted
mm
the thing is ya ya
yes correct correct correct
correct
ya but it has become draining ah but ya sometimes ya it gets draining
correct correct ya correct correct
can relate lah like you have a lot of friends but you just want to hang out with just five of them lah like that like you just don't want to hang out with them you know
I think it affects us ah like if we ever like once the COVID nineteen is done or whatever I think it will be hard to adapt back to how we were you know
ya ya
ya lah
mm I'm just I don't know I feel like okay
so since uh we talk about this COVID nineteen thing eh I feel like I don't know I'm recently very like
upset about the worldly issue that has been going going like black man and everything right
ya ya me too
correct correct what might happen ya I ya but like err
there's a lot of like bombings also um in gaza and everything so it just makes makes how to say ah it's more we get
ya we we don't see it you know
like I feel like now singaporeans start to realise how privileged they are because like we don't have such problems we do have problems
but I'm also quite glad that
I don't know because we have the general election thing and everything so I feel like I think
to talk about sensitive issue minorities and everything so I feel like I hope that
once once the COVID is over or what there will be more err faster I don't know
basically be more open to such issues instead of oh being
close minded that kind of thing just because the government doesn't talk about it but now I realise oh actually
wow we are like ya sia we think we think singaporeans we're like smart and everything but no seh I think
I think I realise that a lot of us like as a nation we lack empathy to
ya to such matters ah
yes correct
older generation ya
mindset ya
ya
yes correct correct correct
especially like you said the older generation they don't agree a lot to our
younger people people's view or or take on on how it should be or what because they think they're like
older and everything but I think it's because they're too ingrained like their traditional values is too
ya
I I I I'm quite
I'm quite glad ah like you know cause like
err I like I have faith lah
for like this
will be a better country for the people lah not just for economic
like it has a certain
image that it wants to capture like how it's very
green eco green very luxurious expensive but
we have a lot of
what is it called
flaws ah
that we ya but ya lah I just hope that things change lah
ya so right now what's important right now is I'm hungry
like just now I eat what did I eat just now let me think
err what did I eat ah oh I eat fatty bom bom
but is a new the new outlet at uh east
at my bedok that bedok heartbeat it open a
it was meh but
maybe because I didn't choose the nice one
thing lah some like wah quite heng lah then I'm like

but their mashed potato nice sia I like seh
it's western everything is western lah with pasta and rice and everything

ya we have to eat you know so I don't know
speaking of it eh what you eat just now ah
what what oh porridge nice meh
you like you like porridge ah
oh okay
not bad ah
wow
now I feel like cause I've been wanting to eat breakfast Mac McBreakfast sia
ya we don't I don't
ya but I wake up
there's there's a ten minutes break
it's not a shift ah it's err like
ya it's uh eight to five it's not a shift
there's one hour break lah
but like but like I have a ten minutes before if I
if we bring bread or what you can eat at that point of time or buy something
but the thing is I want to buy but I've to wake up early and you know me
mcgriddle
ya but I've been wanting to buy it just now but then I was
like shit it's too early and then I was like shit but I I miss I
like other timing kan like it's not always like a constant err
fixed menu right why ah why they do that ah what
oh oh ah I like heavy because if I eat light I will shit
and then okay basically ah I don't know maybe got something wrong with me ah
but the thing is if I eat something heavy or what it will be okay I don't know what's wrong with me but like
I think they have the plain one the plain one is my
okay so
uh huh now I hungry sia shit
okay so
what time did we came here ah
eight
no like in this
contraption
okay okay so I'm eighteen
ya we met in poly
cause mm
interest group ah
ya
okay ah okay ah okay
okay it's okay don't worry don't worry okay
where do we where do I start
okay so okay I
springfield secondary
ya so I
oh you didn't know oh okay
ya so I started with sports okay but I bored of it anyway ya floorball then ah ya
four years ah
yes correct from sec one
C division I think we got second then B division we got second
I I I became the captain I think
ya it was like shocking because
okay
I'm like quite a perfectionist
so last time uh I'm not good at floorball but there were like
so I thought that maybe this is the chance to learn a new sport
so you know what I did
okay basically I didn't have the stick and everything I didn't have the funds
then ya I I I
it's the not the wooden one it's the screw-able
that one ya I took it out then I use hanger the steel hanger
to form the shape of the blade
ya then after that I wrap it in wrap the blade
in in tape
as thick as possible then I attach it to the ya to the
I I practise at home I did once bring it at school but uh
ah but if I don't remember but I showed them okay maybe not maybe not
at all because it's circle it's very thick and everything
like it was swollen
ya
ya because it's the training stick ah the not so good one but training stick
ah I bought lah using but that's when they they told me you can buy using ah what is it called ah last time
medisave eh medisave no medisave edusave medisave edusave edusave aiyo ah
education whatever thing lah then like
ya lah then I once I bought the stick I practise almost everyday
I flunk my grades literally
because I practise every day I stay back at school ya I prioritise that uh because I
everytime I try to shoot kan the ball will always roll on the floor
it's there's a there's a boy and a girl but we don't mix the trainings ah unless the stupid teacher wants ah
but that's err that's another story lah but like
ya so I train train train train train
and then I I think my teacher noticed or something like that
then I think that's why I became the floorball captain or some shit like that
ya because I trained on my own timing that kind of thing
and I actually got better I actually got better
ya but I failed my grades lor but
it's okay lah I got to be the captain lah so once I did
I
I don't know felt nice but I felt unrecognised
so okay for me I find I'm ugly ah
I'm ugly back then ah honestly ah among the girls and most of the pretty girls already
know how to play floorball
so people expected that they would be one of the ones that will get the position lah
so when I got it because I was really an outcast
not they don't dislike me but I felt
a certain of like acceptance
no acceptance because because me and my friend one side only
to do all thing but once I got to be the captain or announced as the captain
they started like asking me like to join them and everything but I also ask my friend
who were outcasted to join me ah that's how the the team bond ah
ya but then my secondary school like quite dramatic also ah I'm sure your one also dramatic right
oh
oh okay
you you involved
oh
I'm okay with you
oh
okay I'm quite
quite surprising seh to find out that your most drama life was in poly
class drama okay I think
mm
that's good lah because for me I'm involved in it because of the people I know
the floorball drama is I'm not involved in it but it's just that you know
there's a lot of rumours about very petty lah just about girls being pretty then
they date date they date date date date and everything
yes so
so I'm not involved in in it anyway it's just like that kind of thing but I also do
stay away lah from them but then if you want to get the team together you kind of have to
kind of get on their good side so that they can listen to you that kind of thing so
but it went well lah because we're the most bonded
team ah because we didn't like the seniors the seniors very stuck up
they think they're good and everything but we got the most achievements
so we're like leh we're a better batch
ya we were the junior team
and we brought a lot of medals ah
ya so
secondary school was fun and everything then I like failed math then I'm like
okay so what's next so
so I go and do then after that oh I oh design don't need math
uh my science also but it was a D seven I think it's a pass but my math was the one ah
but then I was I chose a design school so it didn't matter that much I guess
my language was okay
so now ah that's how I got into ford lor
ya
that's what I was thinking cause
uh I heard a lot about like drama
uh huh floorball specifically
so actually I was quite burnt out being the captain and
err I don't know just very tiring so for me to go there
and continue it and imagine like it's far it's far then training
that's man I was like
time for a switch up let's go volunteering
in smart asia lah
cause ah my friend also lah cause her friend is in
is the vice president but eh president so she asked me to join the team
and I also wanted to do something
volunteering because I wanted to add on also to my to my
life skill and resume or something like that lah so
I damn burnt out by sports it's I'm bored of it lah basically
how to say ah I actually I love sport
but it took a toll on me because
I had to buy the equipment and and and I'm not so well off too at that point of time to buy
ya it's like a burden ah for my parents to keep buying me shoes and all so I
think
I could come back to it if I want to because
after my secondary school right I actually join external club
ya I actually joined eh few seasons and all but the trainings were right after school and like
so that made me like wah another commitment
but it was already after um
oh haven't it was O-level I forgot then I quit then I quit then I quit then I quit then after that
they asked to come back again that's why I was like no I no to the club
it's um I just feel like I have the passion for it but
it's not what I want to do in the end so
maybe not my passion ah but you get what I mean I don't know me as a person I like to try everything and I want to do
good in everything and that's me lah but that's the thing lah I can't focus on one thing lah
right now it's not I think it's becoming popular
so
it's becoming popular because we're good at it I think now ya we're good at it we came in
the asia games we came in third or second that's not bad ah honestly
but national wise um don't know yet lah but I think not bad lah
not bad I think not bad ah honestly not bad ah
ya but if you if you were in it I think you will know the there's competition to watch
same like other lah
so ya lah I decided to do the volunteering thing then of course I met you lah that's how I met you lah
like
I don't know I was so nervous actually because like
it was such a weird
like
it's not weird lah it's like
it didn't feel like everybody was there for the same thing
it's like do you get what I mean I don't know how to say like some just join because this is the most chillest
kind of kind of thing but some join okay of course I want to help and everything
then
and then like
ya I didn't know you that much ah I think the only time I actually got to know you was during the camp
the smart asia camps right
ya
I thought I thought you I don't know eh I was kind of scared of you lah
I feel like you like a
legit legit legit legit but actually you're very friendly
not like not like you look lah but then you
have the vibes but you're quite smiley lah so
ya but then I also
not I also don't mind also
talk talk to other people so it's okay but then actually
didn't expect then
ya lah actually quite fun ah actually
smart asia was the most randomest
thing ever
quite a lot right
kan in fact
flower actually everything actually almost all
err you did the flowers for the mother's day
for the whose idea was the ignite one
there it's more than one idea we just added added added added added right
ya we we that's that's the best idea sia I don't know why sia
I feel like end up right
we'll always be the last ones to stay back and last ones to do the thing cause we're the organisers of the thing
correct correct
yes correct correct
but we're trying to
the worst I feel like the worst is the camp
because we didn't make our camp remember we made the dance night last minute
because nobody actually wanted to go it's only like five people seven people
then like wah damn sad eh
because I feel like
I don't know like I said I think
people were there for different reasons not particularly to commit to it ah
they just want to have a so like
oh there's actually point incentives to do let's join this one instead and get
point system or something like that
so ya lah I think it was fun lah
but it was like really the really feels like a like a amongst us kind of
like we're the cause we're a part of the EXCO mah then we're just like
let's okay let guys um we plan plan plan plan guys what do you think great great
it's just us deciding among each other you know that kind of thing ya
ya then I don't know
if you would rate your okay nevermind let me think properly
which is the best
experience of
tertiary education
no no no not okay education which stage
is the most ah ya ya ya which stage is the most exciting to you
mm meh
okay lah
happiest unproblematic yes
okay okay okay yes yes yes
okay
oh okay
yes oh my god
mmhmm
okay
okay
oh there's such thing ah okay I didn't know leh
oo
I was quite popular in various gorgeous for being like the top housekeeper like I don't know why but like our sports the there is like even and rope skipping sector where it
wow got vision this is a sport
mm
oh my god you so pro seh
while skipping
wow pro seh
mm
wow
uh huh uh huh uh huh
ya that's why mm
okay
wow
but
it's with music ah usually the competition
oh my gosh
ya
oo
oh
wait so so
oh okay
ya ya ya ya ya
uh huh
seh lah oh
oo okay
is it not your passion also
for fun lah mm
I I also only started dancing
ya but not good
I like free styling but I don't know they keep
every I know can do K-pop ah you know
I free style a lot but but at first I look stupid lah
ya I don't know why I found myself good at it later I show you lah the video
but don't judge don't judge me ah I I no training but like
ya so now so meaning
ya ya
okay
oh
it's like but fast and sync
ah you like the kind lah
ah
okay
mm
mm
it's so
oh
oh not bad ah
okay okay
if win win lah you lose ya
forte kind of thing
okay
oh okay
mm
oh so there's
oh shit
aiyo
mm okay
not supportive ah
oh
oh okay
oh okay
but you got you work a lot of you work ah ya lah
oh
mm mm
aiya
okay
but you made it though
ya ya
mm
that's quite interesting flow of experiences
primary
not really
mm
you did ah
my eh my also same
eh I kind of want to but I don't know what course
but the thing is I also don't know there is there is but the design is very specific
your what going to design very emotional design graphic graphic design
video video so I don't know what I exactly want
ya it can be also content design
or data I don't know lah a lot of stuff lah they want specialist specialist
I actually want to be a creative director
ya meaning
if there's a project visually I'm I I'm in charge
so let's say it's a photoshoot let's say it's a photoshoot
if I'm the creative director
the props is me the concept is me
that kind of thing ah so you can if you're a graphic designer
you can the it's more production
but if you start from designer also can because you already have the visually your own
own kind of taste and everything then you can put the element inside
production okay for example I'm trying to think of
a concept yes okay let's say creative creative creative director um
I'm the creative director of
so the show the art direction of the show the concept of the show
is up to me
can can be
can be small can be big ya can be small can be big um
it can be magazine creative director so can apply for a lot of stuff
so
but creative director is you need a lot of you need to know your shit lah basically
you need to like you worked with so many people you know so you need to be out a lot of
ya that kind of thing also can but just anything that makes it I don't know I feel like right now
I'm not stuck to one just just try everything see what I like the most
but I'm quite I like media it's just that media is
but I like I want to make my own films
cause in films you can make your own design also what technically
I have but it's only for personal videos ah
not not like a thing thing kan but I can do a lot it's just
you need nowadays you need to be different
like stand out I think so it's hard to have a brand basically to make a brand
but it's okay lah should can lah basically but anyway I'm just saying like
wow I didn't know that you had that err roller coaster of jumping on
a lot of interests and it's very different from each other
ya cause I'm just like
oh that's how you get got into culinary I I'm quite like surprised
I can't believe that like what really everyone
ya what what would you do if it's not
actually you can seh I don't know I think you can eh no but you can eh
but still your design not bad
I think it's not bad it's just that you needed to develop it
but mm
develop which one ya cannot decide which is actually same problem problem with me I also don't know what to focus on
but then they say it's good to be good at everything
that kind of thing
master of none
okay I want to work as a
the end of the day but then not just grades you know but nowadays it's not really about grades so
you know what I mean
that's why
ya but I think nowadays
I don't know how to say adaptability
maybe I'm just being biased but adaptability I think ah poly student will adapt better than a student
which is unfair actually
like they say they say get experience get experience we have experience
oh sorry ah you don't have you don't have a university cert you don't have a cert so sorry ah sorry
then the other person will be like oh uh you're accepted then I'll be like huh why I wasn't accepted
oh the it's not the standard and everything and I'm like oh and they have a higher pay
just because you know unfair quite unfair quite unfair ah
quite unfair ah
the world is unfair but it's fine you know what they you know you know a great person once said
like is unfair so that it is fair to everyone
you know who who said that me
no lah no lah I I made it made it up myself
I think it has to be unfair for everyone so it will be unfair for all so it's like
correct correct
which is why I feel like
it's not fair to judge someone
uh like by how much they work
cause like they always say this
uh if you work hard enough you will get it actually not true eh it's all about chances and opportunities and connections
and that's I feel like the reality of it is true is
it will never be it I don't know ah but it will never be measured by how much you work
is it will always be measured by
it will be controlled by someone who has
the upper hand
that controls how much we work and all cause we will
like how to say you'll never escape
you will always be working under somebody
ya that's why like robot robot robotic
ya but like ya I feel like I don't think
I feel like being rich here I I could be a
that's like the same as me being a evil person
you know what I mean if I'm not fair lah if I'm not fair
labour it's like there's so many chains under
I think humans are the reason why
we don't do well we just
ya
correct
so it be forever like a cycle so humans humans eat other humans lah to survive
where it should be like
I got your back cause I'm a human also I wish people like
a bit more
section
no like more like basically understanding each other instead of
just
uh just see it as it is
like it's a bad thing oh it's a bad thing but there's more to a bad thing the bad thing could be like
oh the person didn't mean it it's by the own circumstances that made it like that you know I mean so
yes correct correct yes
ya
like I've always thought about it like
being good and being bad like
if you have the
capacity to be bad then you have the capacity to be good
if you have the capacity to be good you have the capacity to be bad
so not everyone is good not everyone is bad everyone is just human
kan you can't compare to anyone else because we don't know
we don't know everything ah basically
ya correct ya so we cannot like judge
but then judge is in our nature what

okay
ya I'll open the prompts
okay
then to start with the first question
granted
okay I also wait you think for like one second
okay
uh hmm
I will be so scared
oh oh in the in the bathtub is it oh you
hmm

and then I'll be scared to I don't know go to the future or
will affect the future
ya
cause I think I'm smart already or something
ya
okay next wish hmm
I want to oh if I got a power

but they never hit you right they cannot what wait your parents didn't know wow she sleep she sleep
oh tell sike ah ya lah you are like already adult young adult okay lah not bad
I mean like some people start like even younger but then what since primary four then you keep oh try try jer eh
wow wow
I also want try
what does that mean I'm so sorry
oh oh oh
wow teach eh you got tutor got mentor already from the start
but now cannot lah twenty years old oh twenty
no ah you look like ah
kan oh my god you know like every single time I tried it's so difficult I like so like cause I used to be in a sports right now I had to like stop because err I got injured
what the hell
no no no that is very unhealthy that is a unhealthy weight to lose weight no but anyways
then you will rebound back ya so now I think you are damn traumatised too oh my god that was so bad but then like you didn't know
like light snacks
no but like you also have to think like in a in a healthy way
it means maybe he is worried about your health then like for you to get both why you want motor though like I planning to take car like next year why motor
mm like your brother mm wait are you an only child wow
wait wait he do army malay army quite shocking ah cause you know they always jio us at
they throw malays everywhere but the army
of course lah but
the thing is I also scared cause did you hear the cases like female in the army like the chances of them getting like harassed sexually harassed like a lot of things lah you know last time malaysia had like female army also then they abolish it because event the sergeant all that rape the girls
I mean like that's like the ones that speak out some of them get silent like don't tell but if you go then I wish you all the best hopefully
ya those are like misogynistic people I hate that but like I don't know cause I always thought like I can juggle myself but I hear my friends all that the thing is like when you are at the stage K maybe cause you are strong but
no I don't think we is worth comparing like that itself is itself a whole different issue ya like but then and racism is completely different but the situation is like of course ah but like black women have it worst
you mean over why you refer like that
but he his child is what he believes what you can handle yeah cute ah you you thought like your friend like that
that's
too formal ya I think he also understands the way we err the way we speak
how are you gonna disrespect orh
ya like I don't understand err
then like just leave us alone if you don't understand us you know you don't respect us also there's no need to like bash us just leave us alone
sometimes is the way they say is very hurtful ya mm
how they say like last time they small young they pray so many times do this do that I'm like why
say it out loud if you want to say you know there's a way to say it across without I mean you get it there's a vibe ya then sometimes if if like more than one person say is wrong and this is what we get from you then you still reject it it's obviously not us it's you ya
I think is is how you act on your jealousy
I don't know how it digress but if you get like license motor you want to get like what type of motor wow
that's first hand right I think my friend bought second hand one
wow like that's a lot of money sia
oh
I haven't even think about marriage eh I wish I was that far ahead
really err I just broke up ya I don't know like during circuit breaker you know then like things just ya also like not worth it lah cause like is err I don't know I'm trying to re-fix you all first
but like what do we know we only know what is our own thoughts only but other people learn from him ya
will you let me refer cause got manner
for how long how long is that wow six months one K wow that's good oh ya I mean we all products of capitalism
no cause no I have a business course then the teacher keep doing that you know for the economy to run they need the people and singapore main resource is the people so we are like on a train

astaga I never heard
they will hate all of us you go first you go first

I'm not sure yet like ya I mean I just want to drive my parents around lah
yeah I think yeah that's the priority actually I plan to take it this year like my birthday passed but like chun chun right like the month I want to take it then circuit breaker happened
walk in and like ya a bit the timing ya cause like if I start in april this year what if I finish it next year june july cause like the estimates my friend got like one year mine is the shorter one ya that one like she go everyday or what lah clear

ya
and you are alive only then you read the next line please
serious
and you will be comforted
I'm telling you that I wanted to buy
no it's not lit it's just a book that I read for fun two years ago
you know what that story is about so that story is about actually when I read it two years ago I wasn't a lit student so I didn't really quite understand what it was about but now
I'm trying to reread it again and try to know but back then my point of view for that book and main whole story plot
a few years ago or a couple months ago he suddenly refuse to talk he can talk but he refuse to talk and he say he cannot talk like he's in denial that he can talk so he just writes like anything he says wants to say or like anything he just writes it down
he didn't fell in love at first
and then like they help through each other ah but eventually the girl committed suicide by jumping off the bridge that's why the cover is the golden bridge
you look at the back you can see the girl at the back
at the back of the book
ya just flip it over you can see the girl
oi it's at the back it's at the back page of the book just find it that or is it in front oh okay I'm sorry I can't remember
remember me

what
ya what
uh huh
oh ya is it grazy grace ah okay ya ya
ya because it's cement no one
like who in the right mind like okay unless you are psycho or like a over thinker over over thinker
but I like grazy grace mainly because of her content like her criminal stories
become insane like a psycho
graduation
like you know ah I think if I'm not wrong there's like a universal language where it's like basically just signs and you like those signs that actually has specific pronunciation to it pronunciation or something like that miss lee told me about it before during lit class I think was like a few years ago
but I remember that because she ranted on how much she hated though she ended up being a teacher
really
what
hais
late night talk late night talk
plagiarism lah
um
if you ever do have a like your own house what type of interior do you want or like what type of vibes do want to get from your house
you know girl
why
no is it
what
ya why
exactly it's because of the branding
so you need to find if you want to live a minimalist life
then you need find different sources you cannot just go to like a specific shop
well that's the irony there then
ugh I don't want friend you anymore
like I want her I mean him to have his own house like
he's like I don't know he like to sleep like dozen places you know he like to hide under the sofa
you want to come with me
no girl that's just psycho I want like blackout windows
I want blackout curtains so when you close the curtains you cannot see any light at all
you bet I'm going to sleep the whole day girl
why you
how can you live without like fresh air
you have lost your mind
like last time before was famous like this famous
like back in twenty seventeen they were not famous but they do exist
oh wasn't that when dope was released
ya I like I like baby jungkook now he's so aww
would you live in a maisonette or a condo
oi
why
why not
or condo
why you don't
one why
why then we might as well live with your parents
like she's very sheltered in a sense can you get what I mean
I don't know what I ask her ah and after that she suddenly said like her mum ah did get all As for like her O levels
then I'm like oh then why why is she not working because I legit ask ah out of curiosity like I wasn't asking in like a way to downgrade her mum then after that she said ah
then I feel like I don't know for some reason I feel like she has a very atas lifestyle
I mean that also I travel almost every year
I mean the places that she travel is not like places of my interest so I don't really care about that
but she has like pass pass pass
and maybe because of that right because of how she have the that type of lifestyle kan it does affect her in the way she thinks
she thinks it's like everything is easy to get and like if this way doesn't work out for her right
then she will get like super sad about it
ya
ya
I mean
why
so you don't know insha and christina are both captains for the netball team right although I have already get out from the school and like shit they are still like one year younger than me right
in terms of responsibility right if I was still in the team lah I would have like shouted at her but then oh my god just thinking of it frustrated the shit out of me
on like they went out and then they went out then they were like okay already then I'm like okay cool then after that the next day on insha story there was like this tiktok it was like a repost of someone's tiktok then ah
like goals that things I want to do with my best friend and one of it was like get married then after that double stuff like that
and it just doesn't make sense to me because why would you have a boyfriend if your boyfriend can't even pay for you girl and like girl why would you go on a date without money girl you okay it's just three dollars
I mean if you do if your diploma is in like in terms of food and recreation or veterinary I think they

hmm

we haven't seen each other for
long time
wedding eh
but do they have a
a great wedding
what's that
oh
who's that see
why
hello baby
oh
mm

okay hi azli yes and we both of us are um married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say oh automatically I said yes one so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like ah because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
uh condo credit card car and whatever the C lah but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like um like what you want to do when we get married
will be like oh no this one lah
he cannot I already mah so you say that you end up
so when that time when um it was my turn right um I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like um does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually um proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up ah that time we were already like twenty seven I think
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like uh knows um a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
ha decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married ah
because of the and the right that one all um we we prepare ourselves yes uh I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
uh we all all our by ourself lah
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like um they say it in um
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them ah then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think uh we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars eh I was about to fork out everything eh to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't eh I was actually thanks to
ya because I trust them so much
but then uh at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because uh it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give lah but that time
ah ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways uh it actually works I print exactly lah that's why ah you got extra correct so that time
so uh eventually after that we that's not the only problem ah during our wedding ah actually my greatest fear for uh
quite popular in suria also and uh he's one of the funniest guy ah I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out alah
ya wasted sia it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like walao not on my wedding lah sia
but before our wedding there was this uh issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free lah contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the eventually become better eh best eh until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also uh still wish us and he is like one of the best I feel lah so shout out to azuri and then um
ya our our wedding take place azuri azur but uh the his name is azuri
okay
so ya okay so
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the doesn't show up the
ya
is very much um
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy err better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya
okay so ya make it a drive all right so um is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage ah the wedding ah
oh ya the weather it was nice ah
mm
ya
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
eh
ya
mm
ah
mm
ya so that was like one of the luckiest thing ah for you ah for me the luckiest will be the photo ah no no not the photography the photography was good ah the no ya
photo photo
yes correct the photo booth so photo booth
game what my friend did she's amazing ah that time she and her boyfriend she did was an she did was an amazing job
because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of um crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
kan ya so just to ask you again but um
we go through like a lot of stuff lah eventually until now even though it's
ya
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
uh marvels uh
um some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
is travelling kan
mm
ya
chey that was a punishment though
eh
I don't know eh oh I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me ah I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry ah because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also lah
no lah but then but
ya
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then um like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that um we wanted to do lah
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
they do their own way marriage lah
ah so that's why lah
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so um
can I just ask you another question ah before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me lah
mm
eventually he is like one okay guy lah so okay lor okay last question
last question lah I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me ah
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding ah marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity uh I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault ah it's your fault but then um there's no such thing as tercheat ah
ter ter there's no such thing as that one for for what I know lah
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me lah
ya correct ah then about uh then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people ah that one
uh never give me stress also because like the thing is that um in-laws right
okay lah still got we we there was a bond there ha and now uh we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then
uh we want to create our own family here lah ha
so okay just just before we end all this finishing
is there any future um request
as a husband towards me for
let's say if you want anything that you expect for the next like ten twenty years okay let's say just ten years lah we are already in our
oh my god do I know this
okay I think uh because um for the last past five months eh five years I have been like driving you crazy kan okay the thing is that um
okay ah I for me for the next like about maybe around ten years before we reach that mark ten years mark I wish that we have
a a small family lah like another um junior
either junior girl or junior boy doesn't matter that uh another person ah in our family lah kan
yes because I want to be healthy by the time I'm
getting older you know I don't want to be like like sixty already and then cannot breathe already you know something like that
okay so um I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually uh know
about you more lah
because of the time lah if I got time of course I don't mind cooking also where is like parts of the marriage can say that because like other people need to eat but the thing is that uh to me
I like cooking lah not really into cleaning up ah he likes to clean up so he would assist me in the cleaning up ya kan
okay so um that's one thing I like about so that's all about my wedding and my marriage and my life so I'm very happy and I think that's about

okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber oh my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
oh my goodness then he was like uh then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself wah is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping oh my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling uh gacha for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn gacha so I can just earn back everything and pull more gacha
then another one they
he what ah he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market lah that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on gacha the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars lah at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
he's so hot like
um what ah
uh I was gonna say something but I forgot
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like uh an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no uh fifty thousand yen in is
okay lah six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money lah but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like huh that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot sia is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay lah my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd lah I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what ah
uh shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that one wah that one is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because eh he quite handsome and his power quite cool
ah I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey kong and he has never failed to turn up with every single eh this company lah this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver ah I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey kong in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on gacha he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey kong's the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title oh I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
ah uh did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that lah
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
oh ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before changsub enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing ah so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
you
like
discharged
huh serious
alhamdulillah I don't know if it's the right
term but
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing lah but
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
oh
oh serious
mmhmm
I can I I remember but I cannot remember ashraf
I think infantry is like the main
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is ah boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically lah but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
huh
heartbreak
oh
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
uh what's the one that the Ghibli one
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
damn scary
serious ah
bestnya
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying oh my god
when was that before the after war
suay
wah that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
ah okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
hiroshima
karma
wah I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how oh all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
the nuclear plant
huh
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow ah
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares what you will literally like stare like nobody's business
oh speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian aceh is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one lah
that's true
huh serious ah
then they said like
uh when they is the causeway open already
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
ugh
ugh
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then uh for all the people apparently
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot eh my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
I don't know lah it's just okay lah granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever lah it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
please lah if they
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
then the money shouldn't it be equal
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that it's not shahira is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really lah she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
oh
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism
ugh
I can't believe she's in uni already that's insane
makes sense though
bestnya
I also want to go overseas study
ugh my heart pain yesterday
you have to bid it's like imagine but like on steroids
my heart pain I was I was more sad about the fact that we wouldn't get to go uh university exchange because look at rifqi he's still so close with his two friends like eh I also want to be friends with a cute japanese boy okay
I'm sure like and not gonna lie if both of us had applied I'm pretty sure both of us would have been shoot in students
like not gonna lie like I don't normally don't have that much confident in confidence in my abilities but like
wah
twenty twenty man one more and I can't believe it's almost november already november december eh
and this sem okay lah given that our assignments are quite hands-on all that we're moving so fast

holiday destination where I want to go to
like last year we went to australia that previous year was europe and then this year
there was no there's nowhere to go
the cruise ya the cruise
so
ya it have always been Airbnb okay
Airbnb where you get where you get comfy bay you get comfy pillow comfy
toilet comfy kitchen hall living room oh my god ah that is so nice and we don't have to go far lah we just
all we want is just maybe to go to our neighbouring country you know like malaysia
err I I'm not sure because I don't think they have like us safe entry or maybe trace together
and um I'm not sure whether it's compulsory for them to wear masks there
and then um
because johor has err strike up the numbers has strike up so and it's a red zone
so I don't know whether because err the last that I heard was that the our government will allow
both boarders to be opened only if johor um numbers demote back ah but I think after a week it does in its red zone
mm
ya I still have my dirt bike to go oh my god
ya it's on the date it was it's on the day that
err the government of malaysia actually wanted to close down the borders
I was like oh my god
I I paid two hundred sing dollars for the dirt bike you know
I didn't even get to go and I was like should I and and we were like should we go
we were like should we go home that night or should we go home the the the next morning
actually we wanted to just go for the dirt bike and book a train ticket at night so that we can go back to singapore
but then I think a colleague of mine her mum was quite worried that we don't even get to
err ya get on board and get back to singapore on time ya because it closes at twelve you see ya just say twelve so
I was texting I was texting the dirt bike organiser I was like hey I get this um news about your government closing down the borders blah blah so how how is it now then she says that okay
err we will put aside your name and all those stuff so once everything get back
to normal and all those stuff and then you know
um she she will email us and we have to confirm the date in within six months so I'm like okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm or their business may flop you see
ya I saw like um
the europe
country is new zealand and I don't know which other country allow the singapore is allow certain countries okay example one of it is our country lah singapore to actually go over there without having to um
isolate ourselves lah but then again you know if you were to come back to singapore you still have to abide our the ya the rule by isolating yourself for
two weeks
so I'm like and the cases in europe ah
you know higher
ya actually lah because it's like you know
mm
mm mm mm mm
I think this is the err this is worse than SARS man
ah okay lah that's nonsense lah we all know that's nonsense you see
ya there are some like you know they are being hospitalised for a month or so like six months three months four months and some are in
so it's like if it were to be that easy I don't think any other countries will have second lockdown you know
that german is having a second lockdown europe is having second lockdown and then
um we are having this thing we call circuit circuit breaker for like two months after that phase one phase two and now when we want to open this phase three also government is thinking twice thinking twice whether to open and they have this pilot thing going on like you know you can go for clubbing but you still have to wear mask

but it's tiring ah
it's really tiring you know
after I try
so I try to clean up a bit
which is difficult lah because you know how many times I clean in a day
it's a lot of times you know
so I have to do a vacuum again ya I I vacuum like
I cannot see it if I see it

I do not know what is it
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
or
three hundred
mm
hmm
no ah
so it's gonna be difficult lah so lucky thing also lah we never go cause now I'm rethinking twice do I really want an do we really need an is like a lot of space
and a lot of space to clean up
so
ya I will need the space ah but at this moment I try to
you know so
kitchen
mmhmm correct
which
no aira has her own platform
a'ah lah how do you feel about it
I thought he had a not say a girlfriend lah but there was this girl
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
how to react how to
mmhmm
but
but it's not due to ian or it's due to to him the family
mmhmm
mmhmm
no lah but I I do not know
oh ya we don't know ah we never
as a stepping stone
no
more of it is actually hasif because hasif is very outspoken
mm

mmhmm
mm
uh it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's uh the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer lah
then uh I have there's a whole checklist of things lah that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
err groceries she have to go to a few uh supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing uh all within her area
so it can be like anything lah depends on the product they are doing the survey for
to actually err
err do a survey on the product pricing
mm
mm
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result lah responses ah
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
but it was just like say uh one retailer then I think two three usually it's three and more lah three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred lah is only but it's the pay is good lah for that time
outlet kan then um
ya
uh price about it it's the same lah because it's the same retailer pe
and then err I had uh my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper lah like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience eh
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything what at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so err it was interesting then after that err
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them lah then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya lah but then no choice what and then is this this is like uh you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also uh
they they know that mean their their company already inform them lah like
maybe informed the manager lah not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
that kind of thing lah they don't say like mystery shopper lah maybe surveyor lah
ah they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one uh uh a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
mm
then too bad lah then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know lah that this week uh got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
uh customer service you know that they can give but then uh other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that lor
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
one year eh
mm
oh my gosh
mm
it's like part time ah
oh
wow
okay
mm
mm
just nice
mm
ya lah
that's why
mm
mm ah ah
mm
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
mm
ya but
wah that's nothing new lah because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game ah
mm
mm
mm
and then like uh my friend was saying ah like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good lah
ya lah no it's more than ten I think
mm
true lah
ya lah
mm
ah
mm
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
mm
oh
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance ah like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only ah
ah
mm
orh
ya lah
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
mm
mm
oh but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
mmhmm
huh
ah
wow lucky sia
hmm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya lah
oh ya
ya ah
mm
ya lah like they have to save cost lah if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like uh reduce the
the
the rental right ya lor
mm mm
why
mmhmm mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
mm
oh my god
mm
mm
oh so interesting
mm
oh
ah okay
mm
oh
ya lah
mm
ah that's smart
ya lah
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outsiders eh
mm
ya lah ya lah true
mm
oh he's staying alone now is it
mm
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
mm
ya lah true
ya lah ya lah
mm
but it's good lah I mean like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also ah
and then uh we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in eh
and
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see lah like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then uh don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking lah but
yesterday I I just yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin ah so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and uh and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel uh travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know lah but my whole company is like they freeze travel lah
like for to do travel booking lah visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
mm
mm
ya lah crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing lah basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter eh
from like ah ah headhunter agency eh no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
mm
mm
ya lah
kan I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight ah I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got uh really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya lor makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is uh four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can lah wei cause uh like more senior level lah like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky lah they get a very easy boss
with
eh you never know you know my previous company there's this one err uh E old she's not just senior she's also old
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do lah
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
ah yes yes yes they say golden handshake lah but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department eh
because obviously you are being paid too high lah and people have eyes to see what so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall lah like too bad
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every uh I think september october period she will go
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
uh
oh my gosh ya lah she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive lah because she's such she's so rich eh
mm
ya lah
mm
ya lah that's why I was like uh oh my gosh like so some people are so lucky
oh she's been there for a long very long lah usually those uh who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
mm
mm
really ah
mm
mm
ya that time my friend got told me the uh one of her experience kan
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the or something then she was then the but she already got the authority lah the the boss will give her the supplementary card eh but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever lah whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her uh eh later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like wah so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool lah like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
uh ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's uh he already ask me to pass you I was like
mm
ah ah
uh huh ya
oh
mm
mm
mm
wow
mm
mm
huh
oh my gosh
mm
mm
mm
ya lah at least can just must tell him right
ya lah irritating because usually when they travel it's uh company what so but they can accumulate their own points
haiya
ya lah
oh
mm
mm
ya lah that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing one then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one ah
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right ah okay then we can get the cheapest ah like more less less risk
ya lor
mm mm mm
cannot lah cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because uh it's I think oh that one is because the name
the name is uh typo error or something typo
but it's so irritating seh because we went back and forth then I was telling them like uh when oh no the
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
back button ah
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one ah the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name what I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly what
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like oh shit
auto fill so uh I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill lah
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
anyway so I still have to pay ah I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited ah no show ah
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
mm luckily like promotion and cheapest eh
oh I go and book I go and book because it was like so many people travelling eh and then I like I get so confused I think at that time I was doing like
seven eight people from my team then uh after that there's like three other people that it's not from my team also I have to do
three others lah uh there's no three of them supposed to be travelling from that night right from vietnam to singapore three of them supposed to take the flight the same flight oh
from the company uh book for us and the three of us supposed to travel together ah
for tomorrow night instead of tonight and did you know that three of us are really at the airport and two of them is waving goodbye to him now because I'm stuck at the vietnam airport
he cannot leave as per what I've already booked for him
panic sia but luckily like
to spare for me because when I called them they say don't have
she she ya she book for me the wrong date and I didn't check and now I'm stranded in vietnam and I can't attend the meeting which he the day that he was supposed to be back in singapore ah
ya lah
kan
ya lah true lah
timing as if you take the next day afternoon flight which is much shorter time in the plane eh
I was like no I just inform the finance uh girl accountant
vietnam airlines I think ya lah
then die die also want to travel the next day but must be earlier must be earlier
ho chi minh ho chi minh
like coincidentally that day really like everything is like I mean that I really have no other seats eh no seats at all
crazy
five star and must be really according to his type of room and must be smoking room he's very particular eh
two colleagues is waving goodbye at you and you are supposed to get on the same flight and then
and they are leaving you at the airport and you are stranded without a hotel and a flight
but actually they they pass everything to me then I was like I cannot you tell me at five on a friday and you want to fly I think some of them flying on saturday some flying on monday eh
ah
mm
oh ya ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
so he take ya lah ah that's why some is his people her people some is my people right it's like different team kan
no huh
after that he we can still like laugh about it that kind but when work is like he's very serious ah but okay lah
after that my friend was like eh I cannot book then I was like eh I got two I still got two rooms you know at hotels dot com it's still uh showing available
mm
mm
oh no wonder
mm
mm
eh like like can't you all like plan earlier is like so painful so I I'm quite thankful that it's COVID now so no travel
but once COVID is over I'm like wah
every time I do travel like so messy seh
ya but it was very funny uh but now now that the travelling stopped for awhile right I think when once it start again I need to refresh refresher courses
mm
ya lah mm mm
ya
mm
mm
oh
ah
hmm
you mean I can just call them and ask
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
then I buy ah urgent visa lah which cost like I think four hundred over dollars eh
I think hong kong or somewhere lah that is a chinese uh I mean a a locals asia PAC ah
not china leh we seldom go china what it's hong kong not
philippine
uh this type of country uh
oh vietnam maybe vietnam passport
passport ah I think passport right
mm
and he doesn't need to like I think it's quite recently that they changed the countries eh
the countries that uh can my must apply visa cannot apply visa on arrival he say last time when he when he go there he straightaway apply visa on arrival it's like no issues
kan
hmm
ya lah
then he was asking me so err did I get my visa already
aiyo
ya
I don't know
ah ha kan
the one with the censored one or the correct one
haiya
hmm but it's fun lah I mean I mean it's it's quite nice lah
mm
ya lah
that's why it's like but I'm just very thankful like so far up up till now it's still okay lah but I'm just say I'm just
counting my days lah I won't be lucky forever I'm just
ya lah
kan
mm
ya lah whether I can whether they will survive or not if they survive I survive ah but like suddenly if they ask me to leave then how
mm local
that's why it's
so should I find a job or not should I apply for a new job or what
ya and then maybe if something comes up
right
ya lah ya lah that's why just go and find only lah ah
just
but like not in a desperate need lah like just send out first and then uh see if like got interview just go and then you know like keep the options open in case

huh but
hmm
ya
ya for real
I mean I don't know
it's like bro isn't that the second wave already
ya but I mean the thing is like
you living under a rock
this this few weeks
oh really oh
ya so boring
eh but you know
because of COVID also I'm watching a lot of malay dramas
for real
so perfect I don't know I was so bored ya
the one that I watch
no I don't know why
I know I've never seen that happen before
like when the drama the drama gets halted cause of like
influence
ya one hour one hour for an episode but
I mean ya it was so cute
I know I mean I I understand the show where it's so damn long I swear
yo but my mum watched the drama like six times
ya ya ya exactly
like even if I like a show pun I would like I probably like watch the person inside the show instead you know like I would search up other shows of that person
than watching the show again I cannot even no matter how much I like cannot
for real I slept at I I started at like nine and I slept at nine reading like the fan fiction I'm not kidding
I'm not it was it saudi eh it was in saudi for real
wrong twelve
twelve
it was a series it was a really long series
but it was so cool ah
like the whole as as much as like marvel movies I could watch I really watch all that in order to understand or whatever lah the end game thingy
like fan fiction
but the
hmm
yes
hmm the main main main one the main main ones ah
endgame
like the solo characters the specific characters
hmm
that's why
K drama
what is that
ya
but damn draggy
that specific drama or like korean drama in general
hmm
hmm
hmm
like scenes
oh my god that's so cool
that is interesting I like to watch video like you know like grey's anatomy or chicago med
ya
similar it's like basically everything that happens in like the in the hospital
got romance also
but I only watch but I only watch grey's anatomy I watch chicago med I don't know why I didn't watch
it's similar lah like the same
ya but to be honest I think it'll like K drama ones are better I don't know why
everything about K drama is so cool right
like it's okay to not be okay wah I was so impress
even the settings like
ya like from like basically everytime like the settings like the clothes you wear bro it wow
but is like probably like two a two hundred dollar hoodie you know like there uh so premium quality one just to make it really pretty and really nice
so ya and then I'm like imagine that in malay dramas
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can
hmm true
I don't know
true
I just
I didn't watch it but I saw and I saw kim soo hyun at the end oh my god
oh like a second season
no but usually no that cameos in K drama in like one and in an extra character at the end in american dramas like probably means there's a second like you know stranger things

why do you mean I'm damn pretty I'm not even prettier than me okay let me continue
okay so I never told you liana or jasmine anything about this but that time I was on a date with this guy we were going
how to say we were going so well we were talking online why are you looking at me like that
okay to be honest I didn't consider it as a date but it was more of an outing okay it was just a outing to get to know each other better ya whatever lah okay so
ugh okay so we were going so well we were talking online and then we decided to go to I believe it was jurong east popeye's you know kan
oh shut down you sengkang ah okay so we were at popeye's and then we were just talking about life we went around oh wait maybe it wasn't in jurong east it was at orchard
orchard kan okay
ya orchard but it was kind of a staple place ah for a date or something like that then
we went uh we just walk around and we talk and I thought it was going so good but the thing is
I thought it was going so good but then after we went our separate ways I saw that he block me on every single social media platform and even my number
I have no idea leh it it was going so well or at least I thought it was going so well I made jokes he laugh he made jokes I laugh
and then after that I couldn't contact him at all you know that's the thing because after that date right usually after every outing I would say thank you ah
thank you for being there maybe maybe you was the jokes he told me
what do you mean okay tell me one joke that I made that isn't settling
the the wing wing joke was so good eh
it it was stupid it's a stupid with you right then a lot of people laugh
of course I know it's a stupid joke jokes are meant to be stupid if not do not joke at all lah you now let me continue woman before I beat you up

okay ya so I couldn't find his profile I couldn't find his number I couldn't find his telegram imagine okay
number one whatsapp number two the normal contact number three instagram number four twitter I couldn't find everything did I say telegram
uh huh
uh huh
eh uh huh
ya ya okay that's true
mmhmm
ah okay
but I'm also specific about whether they are eh yes man or no man you know sometimes guys can be like
ah ya ya ya do whatever you want or like eh no way cannot do that just because you are my girlfriend you can't do that and stuff like that I don't want like that ah I want
okay to make it simple I just like someone who
won't restrict me from doing the right things in life or at least things that will do me good but at at the same time I want a person who can correct me
like if I do any mistakes they won't just let me go off just like that
just because I'm their girlfriend and don't want to correct me like for example
ya I want that type of person it will be so sweet
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya that's true how about your boyfriend is he on the nice side or is he on the mean side
is he mean to me ah
that that sounds so wrong eh
that's sounds okay okay anyway ya it's very hard to find these sort of nice but not too nice guy I know a lot of man who would say
oh this girl is too picky for saying like that if I see these online and then I'm like what the hell do you want to fight me that's like the most basic thing a guy could do for a girl leh
don't you think so
ya
do you think you and your boyfriend got lucky I always feel like that not lucky pe seh but like that time in
he went by chance someone said for you to look into his eyes and for him to look into your eyes are like wahseh so cute
huh really
ah
oh my god are you serious
ya huh
ya
uh huh
maybe maybe he was acting cool you know like those big macho guys like oh my god girl loves me they say the inside themselves

and but the thing is I don't know how
I got roped into this drama and somehow the girl thought the guy was cheating on her with me

because we did we did clarify it with them
the girlfriend lah I'm not I'm not so sure what's happening with her but
ya

turntables or the table turn
I wanted to watch the office but I don't have the

ya
the office singapore version but ya this this that's so far the only drama I have in my life
at mmhmm
eh mmhmm
woo spicy tell me
ah
yes
mmhmm
alright
ya
mmhmm
what
I feel like every time we are at the workplace or something especially if we're at an intern level or like those lowest ah of all candidates
we would always get told to do one thing eh we get to do one thing and then suddenly when we do that thing suddenly someone else say eh don't do it don't do that leh like
isn't that the job of another person or something like that then they make us go round and round and around and then I don't know we we will get scolded for it in the end
ya that happened to me also at my workplace err
mmhmm
yes work from home
ya
yes yes
ya
uh huh
or home or whatever we will we will bound to use it and when we use it of course you have to use it at an optimum speed pe
mmhmm what is on your plate

okay ah wait how long does it take for you to get home let's say you from the office ah

uh huh
you know what topic I'm interested in talking about our good friend J J J J J
no
our good friend jannah
you know we're we're talking about the relationship topic just now right I suddenly remembered her it remember when we went to her house
huh no no no
does she know know not that I know but I feel like I want to find someone for her someone special
I have no idea but you know lah like any of our friends who aren't judgmental
I would feel so happy for her too she's so patient with us and I feel like she would be even more patient with her husband or spouse or whatever they call that
ya but at the same time I want to find someone for her but I feel like most of my friends aren't good enough for her leh it's ya do you have anyone in mind for her
I know you don't have a lot of friends
what do you have
but do you have anyone in mind maybe your cousin your your your boyfriend's friend
how about allan friends allan's cousins allan family is huge eh
oh my god ya that's you know what this is is a this is a hard thing to do we want to find someone good for her but at the same time we feel like our friends aren't good enough for her
so how she's already up there shaza
oh
ya she deserves better than me to be honest okay K K we all deserve the best woo feminism power hashtag girl power
mm mm
elections I
oh I don't really care too much about it but I do stay up to date sometimes what about it
hmm
ya correct correct and the thing is I feel like um to them right voting is just
it's just
something to do and then if it's funny they feel like they should do it which is so weird because in singapore we have this election thing we have to choose and then we are actually serious about it like or we have this good points and bad points
ya uh huh
ya oh ya
but but the thing is like maybe their country is
of course lah their country is super big it's bigger than singapore of course it will be harder to maintain right then I guess lah it's
it's harder for them to keep track of the votes and I I also think that most of them are like or I don't want to get involved in politics so I don't want to vote for anyone you get what I mean
ya correct correct but
nowadays kan everyone is sensitive about everything you you know that
I I saw I saw these two video ah it's like satire and then it's basically ah
showing that people nowadays almost every single thing you have to be offended about it if you don't feel the same way
no no no please explain
ya
wait wait work culture or walk oh woke culture no I never heard of that leh
mmhmm
a'ah
suit so
like in ah if so basically we just have to be careful with whatever we say is it like right now I'm talking to you oh I feel like blah blah blah but blah blah but blah blah so I have to keep adding in defending points lah
but no offence to this culture blah blah blah ya you know ya okay I feel like I understand the meaning of woke culture now is it like a also something like let's say you were defending woman
then talk about rapists and stuff like that then suddenly got some guy in the comments
what about man man also will get ah okay I understand now what lah these people
mmhmm
yes
eh sorry
equity
as in as in financial management equity
equity
a'ah
ah okay okay okay ya
mmhmm
A two
oh unbelievable oh uh uh ya
alhamdulillah
that's true ya okay what is the most fun aspect or memory about that you have
ya ya
that's true
ya ya ya ya
they do ya they do care about us until now they do care about us
ya it is not an obligation to them right for them it's just a natural thing to do
oh my god I knew that mah ya
okay
okay like you already recall right these fun times you or like those non-judgmental times you had in and we will remember this is the most non-judgmental thing you remember or not we were in and then um
basically the girls can put colours in their hair they can
ah I don't know dress ah wear like outstanding jackets and then the guys would taper their pants I don't know in in those little ways it just shows their
their how to say ah their creativity their expressions and oh my god that's so good
ya
yes
miss judy and mister farhan to be honest
yes we really didn't like them
ya but I get you we we didn't really like them because I I have no idea I guess we weren't used to people being harsh to us we were still babies you know we were from secondary school and stuff like that
and ya and ya basically we didn't get to be scolded most of the time so once we got scolded by them
we we felt attacked in a way
um yes
is this relatable woman she you remember when she said that she would drink with most as we some of the seniors like after they graduate of course at the right age remember that drinking isn't responsible before the right age
ya mmhmm
was ya one of the best times of my life though
yes ya
uh huh
err
it's okay it's fine
mmhmm
ah oh oh my god
it's the sisterly affection oh like oh my god that made me recall something
ya
miss really I am not lesbian I have nothing against lesbian I like girls but as at a certain there's a limit to it I like boys I really liked boys thank you for your concern
I think I think mister alan was the one who told her because um our first lesson for that day we was with mister alan ya ya I guess okay I I guess I put myself up to it ah cause my sleeves was wore right and the blood was like dripping but I cannot do anything over it if
no the thing is if I wanted to fix my scarf right I would be late for school and you know instead of being late for
school I'd rather go ah go to school on time and let myself bleed to death that's a natural thing to do
oh my god you believe that story how lah correct correct okay
I
everyone knows that story was fake lady
oh
okay let me tell you ah the the real story was that I was fighting with my cats
I was fighting with my cats because they were fighting each other I naturally put my hand there right ya it's why cat
I'm not lying to you now I only lied to you two to three years ago but everyone knows that was a fake story okay everyone knows
okay ya so I was I was there ah and you you know you always talk to your cats right ya I always talk to my cats like the humans so I'm like
stop it lah what the hell stop stop stop stop stop then I put my hand in between them then one of them
oh got caught caught or
what is it what is it called they they hook my hand basically they wrap themselves around my hand then they kick then they bite also then my hand started bleeding ah
because they follow the owner I'm their owner so if I'm aggressive I'm an aggressive person ya aggressive also but they are sweet too so which means I'm sweet ah
then ya so basically I put my hand to between them and then they scratched me and I cannot do anything about it I'll just
decided or I'll just wash a bit then I go to school lah I go to school then mister alan thought I was suicidal weak weak
mister alan did have you seen this snapchat picture I I merge his face with mine
no no no no as in you know snapchat we could merge our face I put my face with his face right
it was the perfect match I look like mister alan in a young girl's body and I felt
weird later I will send you ya okay to sum sum it all up I guess woo poly aww
I feel like ya I feel like going back right I had I don't know
I want to kit from there the kits that are so pretty and so cheap
I I guess so I don't know I guess ya and then but the thing is I feel like we should also move on lah

mm

hey nurul
thanks for coming here
ya I want to know right mm
what is your ideal vacation like
oh for me kan I think I I really love planning I have to like
I have to know where I'm going I have to know what time I'm going I have to know what time this place close I I love
planning and then I
ya lah for me I'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
and then I also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
this small staff lah these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then I don't know
cause I never gone through that ya oh mm so I wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about I say first then maybe I give one then right
gardens by the bay I'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because uh
it's to me it's one of a kind ah and then like uh so many different
see experience all the different species in one area lah in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the kampung glam area
ya about the old school stuff like uh sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya oh ya and I want to know mm which genre of drama or show do you enjoy the most
for me I really like err
drama like between people I mean I prefer uh movies lah because I I usually cannot sit in one to watch series so if I do watch movies I like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
and then like after that uh
um oh there are some reality shows that I like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and I also love catfish
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
then then then that's the thing I like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya I if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun oh then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
uh it's called kahani ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that um
I watch this movie I think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch series let alone I watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time I watch the movie was during work
so err ya it wasn't even during lunch I was just like
yes
ya so like eh I watched this the second time but I didn't see it the first time but this person that I'm watching it with
oh what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
mm
I think
cartoons I don't watch some cartoons that I watch um
I really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
millions of dollars and I only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's I I think it's still very important lah so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters I think my favourite character do I have a favourite character I like big bird
ya so very cool cartoons lah and like just now you were saying about K dramas right so the K dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first uh
first korean drama that I watch and that's also how I got into K pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
um
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
orh ya lah soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like oh he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the ah every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
oh I like this question because I like wishes
uh
oh not a lot of people will say food why why why food
mm
unusual superpowers wah I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya lah that's that's what I want to
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think uh the reading about minds one sometimes uh I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is um
actually why one thing ah why cannot be many things I say education ya
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
oh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that uh people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
eh then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like oh it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
wah so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun lah
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like wah how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
say if I were to play like music or like uh art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true oh then I wanna ask um
mm
think for me mm
four episodes ya and then err the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
to this place
for me I really love concerts leh like it's too bad lah this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
uh then like mm
for me kan my uh
a higher price
ya lah so like for me uh
as a frequent concert goer kan you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that oh my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
think for me my fashion style I always like to uh dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then uh if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and err I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me kan uh
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
so like err personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
ya what is it
I think this one eh your hardest question eh how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like um say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me uh just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
oh I was thinking
mm korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
chey cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane lah so I the so these are the things that I think about when I want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as uh language culture culture I feel like you can adapt to it ya I don't know I don't think there's a country for me that I wanna stay forever I think I like to jump around
like eh quite cool leh like oh and then like uh ya I like
to actually I like to listen to the leaves and the meet in the wind
what about you is there are there any favourite sounds you have
oh that's cool ya flowers really makes me happy also I I don't think I have a favourite flower lah but I I love looking at like baby breath tiny flowers it's like something small it's not about the size but
especially when they're small and then like daisies also ya you remember the daisies that we saw at coney island right wah they were so cool
ya
very cool and like um
so like what kind of flower like do you wish you can plant
ya
so it's very cool to see um err what is this the flower moving
in the wind and then err
so ya lah I really like flowers I also like plant I like nature we all like to relax right it's so cool

friends lah I I know it's important but then uh friends that can can I think I mean can really together sit with you uh uh I mean like you can share things together
oh yes uh I'm more like want to have a peace of mind lah just want to have a peace of mind that that that I think uh because uh we have been through a lot you know for the past year
you know we have been like rushing through things so I now I think this uh the ten years time is to whereby I would like uh you know um
um
relax myself there is no rushing to settle down
ah ah ah like for you how
there will be new one I let go
um
mm
mm mm
mm
so meaning that ah
that means if in ten years time you will be thirty lah so at that age you
you still want to like uh you know pursue your interest
uh in science
okay
mm mm
okay
uh if there was a drama kan um I mean I like to watch action movie lah actually
ya cause action movie

okay okay
mmhmm mm
mmhmm
how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no lah that one is different question
mmhmm
uh I think fit body lah better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina uh you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors lah okay I mean like everyday life also lah we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important lah
yes correct correct
ya correct of course um of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks uh you know ah people say you have it's naturally
it is naturally lah like that
so what will you think
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ya
ya so you see eh like nowadays generation you can see the different generation eh how they are very um they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
but then they they they always ah you know
that is only external but not internal you see ah this is what they they forgot lah so I think um
mm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm okay because I think about mental health ah it has to be
uh
ah that any friends that you think that uh that support you and any friends that you that uh you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself lah whatever so that it doesn't when you have a problem you don't bottle up
ah at least at least you have uh somebody to help you on how to solve the your problem
you long stem from under you know really overwhelming
mmhmm mmhmm
ah
mm
mmhmm
correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm
mmhmm mm mm
I think ya it's true it's true I think that um okay when you talking about the schools eh um
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being ah they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
can take the stress so you cannot push them further lah
ah because ah
correct
correct
correct
ya
correct correct
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya lah ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
where would I want to go
mm
children days are really a a days that memorable days lah I mean
I I know that it maybe may be sound like uh like not not many people maybe not many people also have that memories children you know fond memories of uh like childhood memories lah childhood fond memories but like as for me
uh as a kid ah ya like work studies stress like so much you you know you eat you sleep ah that's it play around that's it of course always scolding from the parents but after that you find that
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody lah have their own good childhood memories
so how about you
oh okay
mm
mm
the theme
within a floor think you can it you mention long term
mmhmm
um
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
mm
mm
uh three wishes eh
um okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is uh
a healthy life lah
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then um
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children eh when they are in need children in hunger ah you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think um a bit sensitive to their situation
okay then the third one the third one the third one uh the third one
what is it ah third one ah
mm
like for me right I think the other wish is that mm
but um
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy lah healthy body and healthy mind
uh and then the the best part is uh good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good uh behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
um respect others
uh yes then um the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important lah
uh to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
I I just hope lah that my children are not like that and then uh I just hope that whatever that my children do they must uh always think that life is really temporary
uh in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there um
ah that is my my wishes lah I I think for my for my children
for my children
mm
yes correct no I mean uh of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct
ya
yes yes yes yes correct
ah you see
ya no
mm
mm
okay
mm
ya
ya
there is uh good and bad lah we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first eh
see ah there there is a good and bad lah when talking about phones okay uh cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
ah you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy lah and everything information at the fingertips but
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
the I mean it's difficult lah to control it is more I think challenging
ah now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control ah you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy lah it's not really easy
mm it's not really easy
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
mm
ya correct
mm
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the
ah so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
um you see
ya I mean mean of of course
mm
mm ah ah then after that
ya
ya
wah I think ah I think with this right people will have develop more mental health problem

hello

gender ah we are very different
what the shit
oh sorry
you don't have to
like female discrimination discriminatory uh ya
if you cannot look past my curse you cannot look past my tone of my voice then you you you not even looking at the problem at the first place
oh my god
but then
uh what about the things we have you know
but then I've to watch when she watch then I like oh no that's so bad
oh this is so bad
ya and and they have a lot of shows because they are very funded their arts is very funded I mean look at K pop
something that singapore cannot achieve
really ah I don't think they will ever

mmhmm
ah ya ya ya I remember her
mmhmm
oh really
ya you put baking soda inside cookies
mm I'm not so sure I think you can do some uh admin job duties I know in my workplace uh sometimes we have um we need we get orders from customers for bentos or for events so maybe you can try to get that kind of position maybe I can let my boss know whether he is willing to uh hire someone for the time being especially during this period lah
no I don't think there'll be algebra inside so I think I will let him know okay
mm I think like
there's a lot of issues that I see like with malay hijabis not uh not getting jobs being discriminated because I saw like this classmate of mine in polytechnic
recently she did this um poll lah uh asking whether like have any of us malay hijabis ever face discrimination and I saw that majority of her respondents had receive discrimination but for me I'm thankful that so far I didn't face any sort of discrimination when applying for jobs or for university
I'm thankful that I didn't face that kind of discrimination but at the same time I feel like quite upset lah like this is happening to some of my friends who have the qualifications they already have they already met all the criteria they have the skills they have good grades for school but
why is it that they are not getting the job just because they are wearing hijab I think a hijab is just just a piece of clothing it's like you know you're wearing a T-shirt it's just a piece of clothing why why is it that they don't allow muslim ladies to wear hijabs I don't get it
what
oh
mm
wah
ya
and I also have like my cousin she is working as a nurse and you know that in the healthcare industry uh for muslim ladies they are not allowed to wear the hijab when they are doing their jobs but then I don't know I find it kind of weird does the hijab err restrict them in doing any sort of jobs
I don't know I mean when when you wear a hijab maybe they are worried oh let's say what if the medicine or anything like
and I think in social media it has been blowing up ah but I think to know a still they are not allowed to wear which I find it kind of funny because I know that in malaysia they allow their nurses to wear and then I was like thinking if malaysia can wear how come singapore cannot wear I don't know it's kind of weird
really
maybe you should have joined should have considered yoga like even though it is like there's still some warm-ups you have to do but at least you don't sweat that as much and you still feel a little bit uncomfortable-ness but still okay lah ha
aww
it's not fated man
what
there's better men out there so don't worry about him
why
ya
err what what what does that guy do is he working or studying or
oh
ya ya ya

oh world of married
what is it about
oh
oh
mm
oh
you know
lately right
I feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like Syamsul Yusof right
I feel very sad for him seh cause like he's like my favourite
it really make me feel sad cause I thought that was the love of his life seh
hmm
but I don't know eh cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if I'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then um
but I just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
uh children I think one of it
uh is a guy one is a girl
then um I know Puteri uh which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
uh divorce right
it really shows that
maybe Syamsul did something ah but I don't know seh
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like um
marriage and everything
and then actually uh on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick eh but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
wah if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
seh like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya I guess
but you know
other than um
like Syamsul Yusof all right
I also remember got this
I think
you know Alif Aziz
and Bella ya I think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
I feel like Alif is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love Bella and Bella has no choice cause Bella is very soft
of loving someone who is
toxic
why but then bella was saying like oh
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
I feel I don't feel um
um scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
mm
but I think it's also because um he
I mean the other girls were like not even
um saying sorry or anything
oh your hair
um I don't know seh I think you should just
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya so you should just go for it ah
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
ah
from ten to to eh
ya
but I have a lot to do so
I don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
uh okay lah but like I feel like food is nicer
ah which make me feel so like
ya
I feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
foodpanda or what ah
ya
oh my dance classes eh
um
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind I mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
mmhmm
then isn't it better
oh ya I don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay lah
you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
maybe but like I feel that everyone
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they chiong last minute or what
I just feel
so lost
as in I chiong last minute but they all very studious like
three
or week four
I don't know seh
but ya and then
oh did I tell you I met
uh our soccer friends
ah our captain remember
ya
ya the same place as me ah
ah my our campus is
ah Dover
ya
ya oh my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
is like a
a website ah where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review ah
ya and I thought of buying it ah cause like
I feel like
mmhmm
why fifty dollar quite a lot what
oh
but I think in your
because you only receive like nine hundred ah spending money how to save
ya
eh I feel that the money that you have
spend for the month
but like maybe okay lah not that
direct nine hundred ah but like
those kind of thing
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
mm I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
orh for Anas eh
ya I mean I feel for Anas right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple eh
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
because
ya you can buy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even Dakshah had to ask him out
mm
ya that's true
depends ah
uh a bit of physics but other than that no
oh did mama tell you that
oh
mm
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also lah I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
um
doesn't work that way you know
oh he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
oh he did huh what did he do
oh
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
orh but how much were you paid per month
huh fifty jer
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
oh my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya lah you can say like oh you want to help the child everything but wow
that progress and also the time spent right
but really marks where you can go
the place where you
make it or break it seh
ya I mean
minahish and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
it's really scary
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
um the
scary ah that how young and how brave are you to do that
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it seh like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever seh
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then they just um try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
secondary school
oh but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
oh
oh my gosh okay
ah why he like that seh
you reminded me of our netball coach
how old was she ah when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
wah early twenties then she act until like that
oh
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
oh when was I there
oh
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with seh
mm
oh my god ya it was during like the
um
exam kan
I mean how we've been overworked
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
oh I know I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her oh my god
err
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma lah to be honest
mm
so supportive and stuff
ya
I
I don't know if you know this Instagram ah it's called Sanwraps
they sell like the cutest combination of flowers bouquet ever like they have daisies they have tulips and then they have roses
ya
ya
wilt wilted eh
wilting eh
ya
and
ya but the anti is spelled as A N T E A
ya
but it's not I don't think it's halal lah but then
they brew their coffee eh no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
a'ah Singapore
huh why you ask me that
oh um
haiya for me
hmm let me think
actually
I know that
like if especially if my husband wants a child
ya
I mean like you can always say oh I will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
that's why
ah
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head ah
ah
ya
I I don't know ah
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
you love cats
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
mm
that's why
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment
because like
they keep rattling the cage and all makes me feel that actually like house all like not
suitable for their environment ah it's like why would you keep them there seh
oh actually ah
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very very similar to those in the wild
oh
mmhmm

how much was your kurta

ya
escalator escalator
ya
so I had to win that game
mm
in terms of talking or whatever with new people so that was a very good ice breaker like but I don't know if it applies for everyone because some people might not like board games some people might find it boring and that's the starting thing that they do they might lose interest already but I love I love games err and this just brought me back to
early times ah I guess
mm
um the game of life is basically
my friends so we went out one day looking for board games
and that happens to be one of them and I don't know how to play snake and ladders
and then there was
mm
pick up sticks
ya
why
okay okay okay okay according to my understanding
different colours have different points
so the like maybe a a certain colour has the most point
so
so okay okay no no not one by one it's when it's your turn you try to take as many as possible then the moment the move the next person go
ya
mm
ya so the moment any sticks move then it's someone else's turn
back then eh ya
oh ya ya ya
mm
I
oh congkak yes
ah but side track back to what we which one were we talking about which game
congkak yes I actually really like congkak
okay

ya err ya I'm trying to think whether my primary school was like a
ya I was from woodlands lah so
mm
ya ya
mm
mm ya something like that ya ya ya mm

okay yes correct but that's like the cheating way
ya oh my god the amount of money you can get if of that singapore flag
mm
mm
five two dollars ya entrepreneurial skills
I don't know it's okay
entrepreneurial I think so entrepreneurial skills
I do want to have
wait by the way I am twenty four currently I am working ah full time right now um in an office I work in an office job for a business school
um so I'm just giving you a bit of context lah eh um I do
think that one day I want to have my own business
or my little my like a small company or something
like there are other goals I want to achieve first
and then when I am a bit more stable when I got a bit more capital and I feel like it's err and a time where I'm more comfortable
to
go with the business I would
the company
that that idea is taken away that's true but I feel like one of the essence of being an entrepreneur is envision
innovation and the ability to like
it's not say be creative or whatever it's like
finding the next thing like you know that err sometimes being an entrepreneur is not just about the product it's about you and like how you can face certain like situations like for example if someone takes your idea
they cannot take away your entrepreneur skills
but I think for now no lah
SIRI hey SIRI what's the meaning of entrepreneurial
entrepreneur definition thanks SIRI
in terms of business or just in life
business eh

yes yes yes I knew you were going to react that way like fenty is actually her real name like rihanna was a middle name or something like that ya oh no no robyn
robyn
robyn fenty
ya okay I ya either way it's not rihanna is not the actual like first name
it's like robyn robyn fenty something like that I don't know okay but anyway like fenty I maybe fenty was like a very strong family name or something I don't know I don't remember but but fenty became
just something that can be used by everybody and not leaving anyone out and I love that's about it comes from someone who went through that
and like she kept that in mind
no actually it's not even kept that in mind that became the driving force of all her products
like the first brand to have foundation of like twenty plus shades
you know usually it's like maybe half of that amount or like even lesser you know and it's really respectable lah so ever since that that makeup and and I think all the other brands that she's been I mean all the other products ah like companies that she made
like gave her so much respect in that
like err area of business
so I like that the makeup and then she did lingerie after that right and then she has a Savage Savage fenty Savage fenty and then um she also has
err like a luxury line which I forgot ah I think it's just called fenty ya
I miss her music by the way
when it comes to business okay who do you look up to
wait for what okay yes yes
I okay we we're wow this is a good question like what
is success to me when it comes to business mm
I I think what success is
is like maybe lah for now
is
if I'm if I do something I'm passionate about
and I can earn from it like
like I think to me that is success
mm mm
boyfriend ya the one with the kids but they never actually got married it's okay don't you don't have to but anyway so you have to follow all the people that scott disick follows so I realise that all the people that he follows are all businesses
ya go ahead
yes
mm
following ya correct
ya correct correct for all ya ya ya as in ya that's very true that's very true okay so ya maybe that's it
so um
um the account was giving seventy K seventy K
no it's like they have it all the time like I think account they have all the time so the next one is ten K ten K plus err the iphone new iphone
I
oh I said I think in the answers I said my mum I said I wanted to help my mum first I said I had student loans to err to um settle I have a passion for music I want to pursue music and if possible I want to start my own little business so that was my answer like
that's what I'm going to do that's what who I want to share with kind of thing but it was just a brief thing like there's so much more right like I told you right like the plans and shit
ya so
fuzzy wuzzy like
wow fuzzy little hearty we should make a song
fuzzy little hearty mm
ya
ya
ya
wait so the amount wasn't exactly hundred K it was seventy K but round up
what what what
I might keep like one or two or two or three no it's a lot of bags like like
I think eight to ten bags so I would keep a few I don't have
ya
mmhmm
from kylie jenner exactly like it's proven that it was from kylie so that's true that's true that's true
almost luggage size kind you know like really big ones so I think is different for each but I think we can really make a lot of money from there lah but
I don't know maybe like I might not sell lah
and then let it appreciate value like that value exist
I don't know like in the future when it becomes a bit more vintage or something in the and I don't know I don't know either you're still gaining cause you didn't pay anything for it like you know
but okay anyway like ya so that was the competition
ya why ah you you ask me that before
mmhmm
okay
it's okay it's okay so ya okay to get a understanding of women who likes
luxury goods or luxury bags or
okay
believe it or not like I have never like okay I think the most luxurious
probably like coach ah and coach is not even like
top tier ya like coach is like the bossini or the giordano of luxury brands ya ya ya basically I don't okay my mum use to
they use to work ya my mum used to work at coach
like I would really like to own maybe something from chanel or gucci or versace these three these three I really like
mm
ya but that's the thing like I think it comes with the experience because it's suppose to make you feel like
like oh I can afford this you know like so it comes with it lah
ya
so that's that with the luxury brands
mm
mm mm
okay sure
mm
ya
I don't I think it's more expensive than that ya
ah the keychain itself right
me too
but it's okay better times are coming and we will be fine
hmm
I don't know banking
banking finance because you know money is still money like
I don't know about hospitals maybe there's no pay cut but they are affected cause they have to work more hours
ya and we don't know if they are getting paid much more
ya in a in a in a way yes
go frontliners shout out
mm
you not actually nurse
I think you can
I think you will make a good nurse
I think you can
can you
no let's not talk about that but I don't have lah
okay
wait I wanted to share something but I think that's not best to be shared okay nevermind moving forward
mm nurse eh maybe maybe I don't think I would good news
ya true
do they have to go to medical school
to be a doctor
I don't know
wait what are we doing with our lives I think it's
doctorate lah
doctorate degree
mm
doctor fazil
doctorate
and doctorate is like
ya then he make fun of the people there early on he he's like he's like err
I believe there are some err owners here as well how you all get in this one have to pay you know like like he said something like that so it's a joke like I think if I think the doctorate one gets you a bit further lah I don't know
like we generally don't know okay we're sorry but
general practitioner wow
ah ah
ya
ya ya ya ya
wah bullshit
ya
a doctorate
ya like
err okay I work in a business school you know and I have I have a err not lecturer what's it call like a professor whose name is doctor C J maddox but she doesn't take medical she's in business ya doctor C J maddox doctor banu doctor shout out to all the business school teachers
see for ourselves you know it's not a goal or like
mm game of life is not bad so they actually gave give you a wheel to spin it's not a dice
singlish err it's not that fun lah
it's okay lah
also teaching you about capitalism same thing
you know work have family
I don't know
no
capitalism it's just I guess freedom what no no no no no
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya we are toning down a lot for this but okay
yes
nice
oh well you manipulated me
it's about if you have friends who always judge you for your jokes then it sucks right it's better if you if if if they have similar humour that is great that's kind of what I look for also in a like in a partner but
moving forward err ya but humour is humour is a huge thing for me
um
no
next time okay then I'll explain further okay so or there are certain food that I don't like but okay to answer your question no like they don't have to like the same things that I do
mm food is not like a matter in terms of like friendship
astons
mm
ya she also very vibrant
character yes shout out to her but um ya really like andes andes is like one of our go to date places
andes
ya lah we don't know if he's meditating or what but he was sitting under a tree when I was on the way like you know the car passes by the road sides and all right so that that it's exactly like that so he was just sitting under a tree minding his own business so I was like okay
he takes his breaks outside just sitting under the tree calmly okay so it's an assumption that he meditates or he probably doesn't he just like relaxing
ya maybe
ya what do I do to handle stress I can call all your reference aww but err I usually would I'm not
I I don't see myself as a person who keeps it all in that's not my kind of person ah but I'm very particular with who I share it with as well
um like the best of times for me I would share it with the certain people like my boyfriend like um
maybe some like close friends as well so
that
stress ah to a certain extent sometimes you don't need someone to tell you or advice you whatever if someone's there to listen
just to be just to let a bit of load off your shoulders ah it'd be nice
ya
that is not that is not a main requirement and err
mmhmm
I
I guess that's like okay like having that friend is
probably would put you in check a bit more
err but what if you really got no other choice then hearing that is just going to make you feel more like terrible sometimes you know
err I would prefer a person who is down for you who will really really support you um sometimes it doesn't even need questioning you know so ya
you do
ya

I don't know lah cause if for me if I go to a toilet that I know that is not very clean I will
breathe through my mouth I will I will I will shut the nose and I will breathe through my mouth so I cannot smell anything

so
she pinch her nose and then she say

stop it lah sia
and I actually tell you I am busy
my hands are like filled
the worker is not the common worker that I work with right
ah
ah
both of you are of the same size same height sia
but ya about the same size
I don't know whatever lah
I mean I just take the pot and just want to place at the location ah
that really is so funny
there are fun moments really there are actually there are many fun moments ah

as long as you are happy ah
of course ah
when I was in school that's what I learn myself sia B
nobody's gonna teach you this kind of nonsense sia
err I don't know lah they they they I think they don't believe in it ah but for me is I believe in it because build rapport you know why you know why I say this thing is good or not

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
ah
ah okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
mm
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
mm
okay
but you can cook what
okay
mm
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
mm
mm
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
uh good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
mm
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
mmhmm
ya
okay
mm okay
okay
can so
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
mm
okay
mm
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
it's okay I'll ask the second question
um
err
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
mm
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
mm
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
mm
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
uh huh paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane eh
crane
and
and did you like it
mmhmm
don't have courage to try new things
okay
okay
go somewhere else
you say one ah
don't take back on your promise ah
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
oh
okay
uh huh
okay do you have any
mm
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar lah
then you did did you watch incredibles two
mm
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
mmhmm
oh okay okay
then the storyline
mm okay
mm
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
mmhmm okay
then
which superhero movies have you watched
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
mm okay
mm
then
so if you were to
mm
uh huh
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for err err single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal lah his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
plan out their
master err their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no lah professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research what like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it lah and
ya
in school
then wednesday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing lah because many of my friends
they
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different what
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
you mean from my
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different err
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
I like what I'm doing
mm
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education what
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
also
and it's important to start early lah because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also mah
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
eh teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
huh go
after I graduate go
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing lah and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
mmhmm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
anything lah ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
uh huh
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
mm actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
mmhmm
ya
mm
okay
mm
okay then
so
if
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
okay right
yio chu kang all the way
okay
how much are you paying
mmhmm
hundred and seventy seven
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
oh
ya
mm
okay
there's active what
ya
ya
no not pilates lah aerobics
no not aerobics cardio
because
twelve classes
ya group class so uh ya lah so had three class and then because of COVID
ya
okay
ya
ya
mm
okay
ya lah just go for the active one is cheaper lah
ya
mm
mm
ya
I think
ya
I think there is should
but jalan besar maybe
ya have you gone for any active you never gone for you have never gone for an active classes
mmhmm
oh the one at jalan besar swimming pool
uh huh
okay
also very far

then are you still going for classes now
mmhmm
okay
okay okay
mmhmm
okay then
err
hmm
what
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
so you will eat bread toast for breakfast dinner lunch everyday for the rest of your life
ya but you will eat that for the rest of your life
bread
uh huh
mm ya
okay so what would it be
breakfast dinner lunch
everyday
that's more than one dish you can only choose one dish
mm
me
why
it's not filling what
if I were to eat one dish for the rest of my life
maybe fried rice
ya
or your mee hoon
the the the dry mee hoon
ya that's the
one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet mee hoon
okay
hmm
so
mandi rice mm
yesterday
come you you try to smoke it but
I don't know I couldn't taste the smoky flavour or anything
ya and that's what I said what the smokiness

mm
okay lah I mean
it's a normal
I can't remember if you made better mandi rice or not
ya
ya do you stuffed it right
ya
mm
when you try to make like with briyani or mandi I like I prefer

with like chicken curry and papadum
is either a hit or miss sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work
ya ya
okay lah it's not that bad also it was still good
decent
nex
ya
half half
we ordered half of as in
I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know lah mm mm is to cater to people
so things to let people
have a bit more variety lah
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza uh

it's very filling
ya
mm

probably ya I already say what monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months what it's just one semester six months
oh eh not six months lah three months of school
so
no school uh just come back uh three months later
ya
she's working in what
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
mm so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies lah
so ya she already graduated what she she no no and then
ya
so she's working in the now
then is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working lah and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that lah to make money
ya
ya kan just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland ah
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature what
it's more it's less
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries what
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
uh but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
uh huh
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you eh school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
no I don't want go ah
we don't have relatives there
I don't know I think it's something related to
related
ya okay
okay
mm okay
right so I think that's it we can
end the recording in three two one

oh okay
that's the part where we decide if we should get out or not right
yes
yes
hais
why don't you go first
mmhmm
yes the bunny chow
uh huh
yes
ya and I feel like it was a new experience in terms of how they presented it
a full loaf of bread and the top is cut
like like a like a hat it's like a hat like you take off the top
and then a pool of curry inside so it's like basically a loaf of bread with a hole inside and it's just curry
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
a'ah
yes yes
and it was a it was a weekday it was a normal weekday working day kind of thing
mm mm mm

ya
ya and then I feel it's also the the service
yes we did but it was it was a day of of trying food it was a it was a food adventure day ya
yes
oh okay okay ya we tried the
steelers I think it was a local
burger joint but it was a
fast food
burger joint
ya
yes
and uh that was quite nice also
I felt
like not like basically not healthy you know what I mean like you can tell it's not a proper meal you know like I shouldn't be eating this that kind of thing
ya
I forgot but but it it didn't it didn't stay in my mind cause after that we tried steelers and I was like wow a whole new experience ya

I think we also went to this err the cake malay restaurant right cause they they have the in in
south africa they have their own malay community

mm was a thing it was a mixture of things
but it was interesting also
mmhmm
mmhmm
it's a different history and everything lah
different background
ya ya ya
mmhmm but it was interesting also to to experience that and sort of see the different variations I guess on the culture
is it prata
ya
uh huh uh huh
ya ya ya
wow
oh my god bo-kaap okay ya
uh huh
what does it look like
is it like a pani is it like

loaded in every ways
ah
ya
did we keep it for another day I feel like ya

LOL
ya
ya
ya ya ya
ya ya that was too much for me cause ya
I remember eventually I was picking it apart like

and that that was really what it felt like what if if anyone out there wants to know how it tastes it's rich
uh huh uh huh ya ya
ah ya the gatsby ya that's what it's called ya
gosh
we ate a lot of ya
yes
feel like that whole trip was a it was a whole lot of trial and error and just pure excitement on our part but at the end of the day it was a it was a great experience
we didn't do anything stupid that's the good thing
I mean it we did a lot of stupid things but nothing regrettable okay you know nothing like I go back and I'm like oh what did I do you know it was just oh we did a lot of weird stuff I guess
oh shit that was stupid
ah
a'ah
mmhmm

mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm mm
mmhmm
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
mmhmm
mm mm mm
a'ah
ah
ah
it it was still a nice view nonetheless
yes
yes
you know right
oh it is how it feels like if you live next to mountain and you just go up and down the mountain everyday like
like how I go bukit timah hill and I see all these random people run and run but actually they live next door right
ah
it was it was quite challenging sometimes
ya some parts we had to go down on all four do you remember there were like ladders and whatnot
yes
ah
yes there there was five three G or four G I remember
ya
ya
mmhmm
yes
we
ah
it wasn't that bad I felt like the whole experience felt very
good like surreal
ya
ah a'ah
oh
cause we were we were going around in circles like you know a hill and then naturally
eventually there's like one part where okay one part
the thing about cape town in terms of geographically is very interesting one side of the hill you are near the ocean the other side you are near the city
so when we were at the end that's near to the city it was quite hot
kan that was an experience friend
mm
lion uh huh
a'ah
ya
ya ya but they they were had like the the bike gear on and
ah I remember when we got down the first thing we did was get a drink right do you remember
ya
wah
ya we went quite ya damn early
mm mm
and then I remember technically we had time to explore but we were so tired
ya for one two hours then eventually we went out just to have a walkabout
ya
that was quite fun though
that was very fun
the the goal isn't there and then like sometimes I read up about cape town people talk about signal hill and I'm like
oh we haven't went
cause I I like
feel like we didn't accomplish that
okay sure I feel like we are
two zero
gosh
with a whole new list
like the other day I was talking to her her name is amisyah and she's like I was like amisyah I really feel that we go somewhere it's for you ya I feel like you will enjoy it as much as I think and then she's like I did thought about it and I feel like I belong
and I'm like okay put it in the to-do list okay
before we die
yes
but my my friend has a stable job so it's just me lah which is fine
huh
oh wah that was really an experience man
I was telling her about how you how we had one day specifically just to visit all the mosques
yes
I'm like natasha we will visit all the mosques
okay no ya I know as in
I was completely I don't mind it's just like I just telling her
eh do you know or not I actually visit the mosques one by one that was like the most holiest thing I've ever done in my life
I think
oh gosh
ya it was also quite near to one another ya
ya
ya and I feel like during the experience err
while walking we also sort of explored the region a lot yes I felt I felt it was a good tour
yes
like I felt there was also another another good experience though ah ya
ya we did walking tour
we backed out
ya cause we felt like we didn't we feel like what ah I feel like the guy did
did a lot of stuff it's just that I could have gotten information online
it wasn't I feel like I wasn't it wasn't adding value to my things I've already read up on the usual so ya
oh gosh I don't remember mm
ya
oh gosh that was a lot of experience
food wise in terms of like which part the safari
ya
three weeks it was like three weeks but the three weeks we felt like packed so much information didn't feel like three weeks we felt like more than
ya it felt so long
a'ah
uh
ya
ya and then ya and then the weekend trip the the field trip is like forever you know they tell you we going on a field trip
takes like three hours to get there it was it's a completely different town
that kind of thing cause it's a big country but ya
ya ya
the field trip is like it's like hi we're going to the beach then like in singapore if I say to that you think of like east coast park over over there is like we're going to the beach and there are
actual penguins at the beach
like it was whole new thing
that ya
like I feel like whoever planned that whole school summer program really deserve a raise man
yes yes but I feel like it was money well-spent
american ya
ya ya ya ya
a'ah a'ah a'ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
yes
ya
ya ya ya
ya
a lot of seafood lah I remember seafood
ya
ya we were at the coast a lot I remember one time there was a there was the ostrich
that ostrich
farm okay we were at the ostrich farm okay so we knew very well that the ostrich came from breeding purposes like it wasn't a random ostrich shop down the road kind of thing
you know ya
yes
ya
but ya and then we had what else
a'ah
mm
I don't okay not puberty you know when you're eighteen you do a lot of stupid shit it's like that ya like like that part where you
think that you are mature but you are not actually mature you know
ya ya ya
ya
different school but we can trust them cause same land
yes
mm
mmhmm
yes
mm mm mm
yes
mmhmm
ah
ah ya avoid like we try to keep a distance ya
to spend time with him especially for activities that he need to pair up
a good trip for everyone and I feel like that was that was a good move on all our parts you know
cause I feel like even though the boy like
I mean
ya it's a bit questionable but I mean whatever lah ah after that we didn't keep in touch so whatever
it's okay we we did our part we did our our community service for the day community service
I feel like
I feel like we did good you know
like it's like eh
it's like it's a it's a good looking back wow matured
are you serious
but ya that was a really really fun trip I feel
mmhmm
oh gosh the kayaking
ya I remember I was I was really genuinely scared for my life
like I I really could have a panic attack if he just
uh gosh ya
um
the cave
the cave
your favourite
is it what you talk
uh huh
ya ya ya
ya
you guess that
ya ya ya
god damn it
hais
a time to be alive
what else did we do over there
I feel like okay I feel like
the trip was was a fun trip lah if I had to look back at the things that I've uh did in life I feel like that that will be one of my highlights
yes the highlight reel
before right before I die right
this is what you did
yes that's exactly
us getting stuck in the you and your getting stuck in the cave and all that right
gosh
that was an experience
okay
then what else
ya let's see another prompt
I want to learn how to draw
ya
ya I want to draw
cause I can't draw
it's a certain skill lah that's already been presented to me a certain level of expectations of how an artist
should draw or the kind of level they should achieve which I can tell I am not at that level ah
so there's that so instead of a drawing I resort to colouring
I resort ya cause I I do like
err art in general so I'm like since I can't draw
then I'll just fill in the colours for them you know it's it's so
an artist right it it does gives me a pride and joy and happiness
ya yes
and I I feel like it also trains my uh colouring skills
cause that's also uh colour coordination is a very important skill
ya I mean for a wardrobe purposes
so ya
I think for me would be drawing
mmhmm
what about you
just one ah
can
oh wow
yes that's the way
okay
I ah I feel
I feel like the fact that it's on the you know ice it's a bit tricky
and different
okay
wow
a'ah
oh wow
kind of what
okay
uh huh ah
ya it will
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh yes
did they die
oh gosh
okay ya
ya will be fun
so uh what else
two more skills
for me um other than drawing
mm
I cannot swim and the other day I went to this this park with my friend and it was
it was at lakeside I was at lakeside
with my friend
and then I and then I remember ah my dear friend wen xing were walking at this
so I think she she she no no no she stepped on this a creaky wooden bridge and she panicked a bit and she was like I really thought I was gonna fall and I'm like
oh shit if you fall I'm gonna fall also cause we are stepping on the same wooden creak eh and I'm like and the first person is gonna die is me cause I can't swim
it's really during those moments I realised that I should really pick up swimming lah ya
but I know how to swim a bit like I know how to float like I'm aware like there's a certain way of of making sure that you stay afloat in water and I I at least learn up to that point ah
so naturally the activity is just go
beach hopping I don't why I thought it's okay to be honest
I I didn't regret why I even but when you think wah it's like wow this girl really spend a lot of money to go krabi when she doesn't swim or kayak so
I went to krabi
with my friend it's just the two of us and I remember before going I already told my friend A I don't swim and B I'm not a water person like I'm the kind where I can in the water but five minutes later I'm like
I'm bored leave me alone I'm just gonna sit at one corner and my friend is like ya that's fine I'm also the kind where you don't have to entertain me I can have fun by myself she she really is the typical uh suntanning beach kind of girl
so I'm like okay okay so the trip is really we just in our own personal space like
like people who people don't know we went together you know it's really we are all both in our own personal space
trip and then like I remember she really was having the time of her life you know like she really down there chilling like there was even one point I told her eh I'm bored
I'm gonna go back to the hotel which is like fifteen minutes away from the beach
and then she's like okay great and then I went to the hotel I took a nap
okay I took a nap for hours I wake up this girl is still not back
so cause it's just the two of us I the sister part of me is like eh shit she got kidnapped I die sia
seven like she really just lie on the beach throughout that kind of thing then I just look at her and I'm like
okay can I didn't even know if I should go and say hi cause she was wearing a a sunglasses so I'm like I don't know if she's awake or she's not I don't know if she's gonna scold me ya I was like
you know I feel like I remember I played in the water again but five minutes later I'm bored
now what ya but ya I feel like uh if I could swim maybe I might I I I feel like definitely enjoy myself
I just feel like maybe I could have done more activities
ya
we didn't do we went the only water activity was the the beach hopping lah so
ya they just bring us to the beach and then they let us roam around for many hours
ya and A and B I don't find banana boat interesting
ya
have lah but ya I also like uh and then my friend was also uh
I I think don't have I don't remember but I remember we went kayaking but the kayaking was very scary cause it's like
initially I thought that the kayaking would be
a a group activity I thought there will be a guide but instead they just give us the kayak and they were like do whatever you want
yes so it's
no okay it was in the middle of the ocean A okay B in the middle of the ocean okay
it's like it's like you you know how in krabi there's a lot of islands so one of the islands we did kayaking and then err this island is a bit small so the idea was to circle the island that's what they told us to do but I remember looking at my friend not gonna circle this stupid island
and then she's like
nadi stop being a spoilsport let's try then I'm like fine so we try
we realised that we were in the ocean alone like I looked around I don't see people I was like eh shit this is like I'm in the ocean alone and I can die and then
that's where all my anxiety thoughts come out while my friend being the typical girl who loves beach tanning was legit taking out her phone and taking selfies
then I'm just like
her name is vishu
I'm like vishu we gonna die then she's like can you stop being dramatic and I'm just like
I feel like okay the thing I love about hanging out with vishu is I always tell people she's my number one hater I mean everytime I tell her my like all this problems she's like
shut up okay she legit she pushes me down there and then I don't know like I like remember cause she's an accountant so I will always complain about how I don't know how to calculate this money and she will just tell you're stupid I know that kind
so
this is our relationship it's really her telling me over oh I'm stupid and then I'm just like okay you're right I agree I am stupid
so throughout the whole trip I will just be panicking and she's down there eh no we are fine okay I'm not gonna die and then she and then I'm like okay but if I
if I drown then are you gonna save me and then she's like no
then she's like I thought you can take care of yourself
that's the thing okay so
I remember like I did panic a bit but eventually I managed to calm down and then we went we went to
uh the big shore
so there was this random beach in a thing and then we went to the shore and we chill for like
again five minutes
cause we we we after five minutes like I'm bored so we went back but I remember throughout the whole trip that whole kayaking I kept telling myself I'm not gonna do this ever again and that was really my last kayak up till now cause like in singapore
ah cause err
ya marina barrage ya ya and then
err I a few people have jio me I have one friend who has the actual kayak lessons so she has told me many times don't worry if you drown I I will save you
and then I looked at her face and I'm like thank you for you trying to act this is a superhero movie but it's okay
I will I will tap out of this korean drama moment
maybe I feel like the the swimming will help the the fear of the sea cause a lot of my problem is afraid of the sea but I feel like the fear of the sea stems from the fact that I can't swim
ya lah
ya ya ya
ya
always doing the bare minimum
always doing the
ya yes
more you already say live one another alone
ya ya wah I I really want to go okay I
I I think after the trip I went with her to vietnam to vietnam
I went vietnam when I went there right
she ya we went mountain wah that one was another one cause she cause I've known her for quite some time so she knows all my problems all my problems
and I remember I tell her confidently don't worry I can take care of myself sis
don't worry thank you for reminding me though
err I was very tired cause I have low blood sugar low blood pressure
so after if I don't have enough food after a certain time ah my blood pressure will dip and then I will faint
and then during that period
my dear my dear vishu looked at me and do you bring your sweets
and I said no
then she rolled her eyes and then I'm like I'm sorry for letting you down again
and then and then I remember on this trip it wasn't just the two of us she brought along two other friends her two other friends looked at us what's this tension what's going on
I like
but really it was like
don't worry nadi I got this I know you very well she took out she got protein bar and okay okay vishu is a fitness freak okay so her protein bar isn't like from seven eleven kind protein bar is those expensive shit kind of protein bar that you need to order online kind of thing
so she give me her protein bar then I like A her protein bar tastes great but B I like shit I I swear I ate her her expensive shit a part of me is like okay I am a burden so yes
but I remember that one trip is like everytime I need a sweet I just look at her like this
then she will take out from her bag and she will like roll her eyes and take out from her bag
I like sorry
but ya I remember ya in the end we reach the top and that was that was really interesting cause there was actually
A cable car up but obviously we didn't take the cable car okay and B I remember
mmhmm
but I remember that
it wasn't that long lah it was quite long also
ya but I remember at the top of the mountain there's a temple cause we're at vietnam and they believe err buddhist country most of them believe that
the higher you are to the sky the closer you are to heaven in thailand also I remember one of the mountains were like that but anyway
it it look like they you go google is like a hole big ass buddha statue at the top like it's like way big like it was a giant-sized kind of thing ya
but ya that was the only thing lah I was just like whoa
how did this work there was no cable car then
how
to the south of vietnam so after a few days we spent one or two days in one country then we will take a bus ride to the next eh not not country
and then I remember in the beginning it was ah there were four of us
halfway through the other two
her her friends had to go back to singapore cause ah they
they had other plans lah okay
ya
of everyone too unsure like should we do this should we not
a'ah
just like okay I feel like okay if you don't want to try then don't try lah like I don't know she will like says ah
and she will complain complain a bit a bit unsure eh maybe we don't do this maybe we don't do that I tell you like
like you can't based your experience your you know all your options on one person's experience that kind of thing so I remember feeling very like
like okay since you're uncomfortable then we won't do it lah cause of that we already have no options and to begin with we already had limitations in the first place
so it's a thing in their they are all accounting students so basically throughout the trip I didn't calculate anything it was my dream it was like suck at math like everyday I just look at look at my team of accountants like what's up guys so
I didn't remember ah ya so the boy like it was quite interesting though when we go on the trip cause they really like wah their calculations damn fast they look like they never speak they already can tell you okay this is not worth it they walk off I like what is going on but I trust all of you
then like okay oh I remember
and then I ask vishu then why you jio and then vishu was like you know I okay with travelling with everyone I always travel with you mah then I'm like shut up lah don't compare me to her but it's
ya that was it but that was a fun trip I had a lot of fun I was talking to vishu the other day we need to go somewhere else like after this border closed like this border thing
ya and she's like okay on
ya but I remember I went where ah ya krabi and vietnam with her
it's oh ya we keep saying we want to go somewhere malaysia nearby cause uh our our clique is actually with this two other like one of this uh basically the two of them they have a a very uh err
tight-knit families
who are unsure if they travel too far
so we were saying since you guys have limitations so might as well just go malaysia lah
ya
oh ya
gosh oh ya and I was talking to my
other friend the other day another friend I was saying that we should go indonesia
cause it's nearby but there's also a lot of places to visit there ya a lot of people don't know about what ya they just didn't do marketing very well like there's technically a lot of places to go to so ya
mmhmm
ya that's the thing
a'ah
okay
alright so how one two three one

so ya
wow
oh interesting
um
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
there lah almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
okay
mm
but when it comes to chicken or duck
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
um
ah mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
is
if I were to be a vegan
and mama
mm
mm
vegan
is is there a certain
mm
mm
I
don't have anything
because of all the free time
um
but actually um
in southeast asia
mm
mm
oh my god
mm mm
mm
mm
ya lah
born born to be slaughtered lah basically
mm
mm
and then
oh okay
start drawing again
err two thousand twenty one resolution
err come back to
I
but
by by time
mm
um
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home lah
ah fully on music then
work from home
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
mm
um
greek
I I
one or two language first lah before ventured out
mmhmm
oh my god ya
mm
mm
so
okay what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
mm mm
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
a total shit show lah
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
mm
mm
mm what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya lah cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
mm
oh but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait lah
um
what else ah
if you go
the the
ah two thousand twenty one
a burst of
creative contents
this this cannot
um go on for too long I have I have to do something to
mm
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
mm
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
mm mm
natural selections
mm mm
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
mm
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
mm
duolingo
mm
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
mmhmm
mm
mm
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
a'ah
mm
mm
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
mm
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
ah
mm
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
mm
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature lah
mm
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
very personal because
mm
mm
mm
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
mm mm
I don't have any other interest
and the new age plato
mm
okay
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called ah the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
mm
the difference
I want to go to greece again
mm
oh in addition to that scandinavian countries
oh ya ya
sweden
oh yes denmark
K lah hopefully next time
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
euro centric okay my apologies
mm
mm
in ruins
mm
ah you you cannot see with your own eyes
mm
running eh
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours wow
wah long silence very long silence
uh huh death to two thousand twenty
but I think it's a good mockumentary lah to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one eh two thousand twenty
mm
and
mm
okay lah if if you could
be your younger self
mm
you know what do you have against schools ah
uh huh
mm
mm
but for you most of that internet lah kan
I think that will help a lot
ah
mmhmm
this one is the beginning okay
mm very anti climactic
okay lah I like new beginnings um
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
oh
mm
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
in a way
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
um
and
you have yourself and people around you
this year
so you
institution
religion
mmhmm
ah
mm
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
mm
mm
that's my vaccine wah
mm
mm
ah ah I wish I wish we can talk about something new lah mm
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K lah thank you
okay

huh serious
oh like that I play eh
I also just finish my exam like a week ago
so
I think I can start
but my rank is really low
like
I think I even hit the chicken
so I'm not sure but I can
log in later and see
I hoped they revamp a lot of the
better eh no their
cause like they are so underused like
I'm pretty sure they still got value left
oh layla and eudora
but
but I think I want to try playing fighter also ah
hmm
but I hmm but I used to play assassin also ah last time but I stop already cause like assassin is too squishy
then
oh and the toxic player back then is
so
I try not to play assassin anymore then my rank also went down like from eighty percent
and then it falls to like
I think it's lesser than fifty
skin is
diamonds
on that skin
I spent like
sixty dollars just for the skin on a a hero that I don't even play anymore
so
you know what
I will play mobile legend I will make that sixty dollars worth
okay so you're mythic but
so if you wanna if you want me to play ah I need to like
really do my research for my sixteen dollars game I'm bad seeing revamp heroes them I'm pretty sure they going at the buff heroes also
really
do my research for my sixty dollars game
hmm
but since they revamp hero
then I'm pretty sure they're gonna debuff heroes also
and then I definitely can't play sixty dollar karina anymore
okay wait no I will I will not I have I have to it's sixty dollars
to do it
I think
I will start slow ah do you know that
all the players are new right but because I'm not new so I'm actually
wait how do I say
like taking advantage
of the situation
truth to be told there's a nerd under there who knows all their builds
and like witnesses
so
I'm gonna like
I'm gonna rank up and I'm gonna purposely lose so that I can stay in this rank forever and feel like a
like a winner
are you with me
okay okay lah if you say the toxic is already lessen
err
but since you're a mage or a marksman then I think I will go for those like
I'm close range ah
err
is it I was aurora
I'm not so sure
hmm but
okay ya I think I'll be the tank I think I remember being a minotaur
and I was just going hulk on like everywhere
I got this one new fighter that I rarely use but okay wait I didn't spend money on this this is
all hard work uh huh
err
I got the premium skin the what is it called ah the dragon
the dragon hunter no so bad ass
take freya for granted so that's why when like if you see people who know how to play freya eh freya but actually I've actually right actually do not know how to play freya at all I think that one time when you did show me play freya and like I got eighteen kills kan
I know you say I'm good but actually in the truth I was just smashing buttons
go back to ranking up lah I cannot stay my chicken lane forever right
okay lah I will rank I will rank
and I like I the few times I play aqueduct but man I'm going I'm gonna hang all the way and zero death brewers zero deaths my kiddie is so high you she's the queue depth ratio you know as it
like I
the few times I play
my is so high
she's the kill or death ratio
you know what's that right
ya so the kiddie eh like shows your survival later but wah I tell you when you play lor ringing like
ya so the like shows your survival rate lah
like wah I tell you when you play low rank right
like it's so it's so easy so like
but when you play low rank the players are also slow
it gets boring kan I need a challenge also
mm that's why I'm trying to find new heroes to play I try cyclops but
cyclops have so many weaknesses
but it's okay I I will practise because I did so much research back then
and my win rate right now is like sixty eight percent I think that's not so bad for just a few matches and some more I think back then
the few matches was like in epic
the rank and come on you don't see people play cyclops in epic rank unless
like one of those suddenly no choice you they have to take a mage so they have to use cyclops
you have to take a mitch whose entity cyclops nail kilo but so kilin so long you don't take our ronaldo aruna is bloomberg to good a good idea
then okay lor but so long okay lah so long you don't take aurora tho
and okay she's good but
but her damage is good but
dude she's too slow man she's slower than vexana at least
but okay I'm like try to play fighter and ex cause
my if I can smash button blindly and still win at freya if I were to put my hundred percent
I think I can
I'm invincible
okay since you have so much trust in my freya I will give it a head oh but
besides freya what else because you cannot play
dragon tales lah
but okay besides fighter do we so need a tank I'm still trying to find the tank that suits me
because I'm someone who
what I say
like have you seen me play balmond I went to ulti on minion
I I don't even think the minion took damage eh
so like
and like balmond is like one of those free lah
choose balmond lah cause I think not many people want to take tank if you really really start so low like you're low rank
then
I play balmond and then people think it's a it's a fighter but actually it's a tank so so you have like extra health
so
while I was on the filed playing kan
whenever people like it's quite easy to it's actually chase players
with a balmond
and then when you start spinning what they don't know is when you spin and you hit
the tank beyblade
you I'm actually gaining health so like what that that's what they don't know so you know my health is going down right but actually their health is going even lower because I'm actually gaining theirs but I only learn this recently cause I
I did my research on a balmond
okay lah eh the eye
uh huh ya I did my research on hilda
do you know they revamp hilda that's why it's actually
uh
a lot of buffs from what I read which is
one thing is the health regeneration
regeneration when she's in the bush
so like recall button hilda they don't exist you know
she's just like working out in the bushes gaining health doing push ups
eh but
it's twenty four K coins and I'm so tempted to buy hilda but I scared like wah I scared like it doesn't suit me but I like the
then she suddenly just ran out the bush running
ya but I will practise her lah if I but I think I'm gonna spend on shortcuts first lor cause like I don't want to waste twenty four K coins I don't have ninety coins in my wallet unlike some people I don't know what are they doing with those coins
okay lah ya I think if we
well but I don't know lah I don't know how to get her I think I need to farm up like farm faster cause I don't know when I'm a tank right I always keep thinking of supporting
other players but players don't support me and I that that that actually kinda applies in real life so
apparently
life imitates art
hylos I don't
I mean the reason why I don't like hylos cause there's this thing where he does is that he will use his own
was it mana to like like be a
that's why I don't like hylos I mean ya he's thick
but
that kind of a skill takes
people who knows how to gauge when
to fight
then when to retreat and then went to fight again and then retreat
then you go into the field full health
why why do they ban uranus though I mean like he's such a
unless
worse eh
um
is it the ban benedetta
I think
what is the new ban like new players
I thought it has always been three heroes being ban
oh ah lah actually cause I think only the last
two hero last two players of the team gets to choose who to ban is it
oh no wonder then
mm then I guess hilda is might be my next choice in
buying
with my poor twenty four K coins left because I don't have savings in a game account I mean why who would do that
who why why would you oh ya cause they don't know how to play new hero
or am I
mm but anyways besides
a tank
speaking about a tank
I mean staycation is in january tho
we haven't even plan anything
uh and everytime I ask haizat
like
his answer with me like always kan always always like
till now even I ask him earlier also
his first reply
okay first day mm
like dude like all the way
I ask him again like
like I don't wanna keep him out of the planning cause like is a three people thing mah but then like I don't eh he's not even putting in efforts man
I would rather we
kinda like
maybe go for lunch even though
we are carrying a lot of bags lah but then um
can manage lah we eat
a full lunch first maybe and that's chicken and this okay wait no and there's vegetarian
okay first of all me and haizal just talk and he's taking two days leave because he's actually working on a saturday
then um so since he's night shift so he can actually
like working on that friday night also because friday saturday sunday
then he can like I mean he disappointed lah cause he cannot go school anymore so he got like ten days leave
then he was like saying since he's not going to school then might as well use that ten days leave for staycation lah
then um
so he don't mind using
two days for the staycation two nights lah
oh
and do you know that
um
on his last
last week before the end of I mean the new year lah so like december I think his last week in during december
oh
like no need go to work like
just stay home and chill that one really like wah christmas sia
ya
I don't see that happening
cause
okay let's have a meet up point punggol tampines and serangoon and it's one off so we all going one direction definitely one direction
then um
he's already boosting my company okay cause like dude he is like always grabbing like he really don't mind spending twenty six dollar on himself just to grab
it's cause he feel bad that I didn't get a grab home
like earlier that was earlier
and like I'm not the one who has to work
at night so I don't know why he so
adamant into
like paying for my grab
so
so err we compromise so then he pay for hair he pay all
no lah not twenty seven he pay for the
altar
he pay for his ride only then I take bus I mean that's fair
now I'm side tracking the conversation so back to staycation so andes kan
um
it doesn't have to be andes we just see whichever is the
affordablenya
um
salad
mm good life
okay so weird we can have a lunch first
we go off lor to the two one of together
and I don't think we are going to no I'm pretty sure we're going to carry a lot of stuff if I were to be there with a suitcase
you have all the rights to just take my suitcase and smashed my head
do it
and then
buy me a
one of those
one of those what you call that one ah sports bag
ya put all my clothes there instead
yes
that that's a promise please if I bring a suitcase
oh wait
are we bringing a rice cooker
because if we are bringing our rice cooker again I need my suitcase
okay okay since we're not gonna bring rice cooker kan
but you say you need rice you need your rice then we have all the
so they have pots and pans then
is it safe to say that we can
cook rice in the pot and pan
like a natural rice cooker we do it natural way even though it's electric fire but still
and then I can
big like the pretty lah the pretty pretty
I think okay leh
fast leh
okay wait wait haizat don't eat spicy ah
oh my god
seeing a lot of negativity about him
ya I feel like I'm just I'm just like talking bad about that all the way
but did I lie
I did not
so
it's facts be ah I did sidetracked but it's not like
oh and do you know that he is he is
do you saw the who who and the care bear thing right
okay do you know that he's actually
he fully endorsed her to wear both
cause he say it's cute
and then he say can he say he say he don't mind wearing also
I am and I I'm I I'm like
I mean I mean if you're happy if you happy that ya go go ahead
but you want to you want to get the shorts as well then
I don't know I just have the urge to throw a rock at you
and then I told him
if you really don't mind wearing that care bear shirt oh my god I'm side tracking if you don't mind wearing that care bear
kan
you one day when we and we meet who who
but we don't tell her that
that you bored but you wear you wear both set like the shirt and the pants I will pay
then we meet who who now want to see I want to see these two
these two species in their own natural habitat and how they interact cause like I don't understand
but why would you also spend so much just to wear inside of your house so obviously you'll be wearing outside at some point kan
but the shorts you got to go though
the shorts is a no no
okay I'm side tracking back
I'm just letting you know that
haizat agrees
and I cannot imagine him wearing it cause he have very long legs so it's going to look extra
extra
whoa you're only questioning it now dude you should have been oh okay and another thing he he actually also agree that you and him are like two peas in a pod
I don't know ya actually you guys are oh my god ya you guys are just that ya different taste one K pop one is like I don't know western artists I guess
why am I the only different one why am I always the one that is just meeting either one of you huh what is this can you all please
do a collaboration someday or something huh
no lah just kidding lah
I am the the glue to
what are you two um
amoebas
okay wait so
before they I don't know where we're going with this but
going back to our stay cay plans part two
then we meet up earlier cause I know haizat won't be sleeping
then we have lunch then after lunch we check in
then we put our stuff
then I'm pretty sure we're going to be like wah look at the bed
wah look at the sofa wah look at the dining table so after we're amazed by literally everything and anything then
mm I'm quite concerned because haizat haven't slept or rest yet
so I think
first on the first day
then after resting on the first day
the feel of where we are
we can go container gym
but I think I would rather just go back to the container and we just
take in the feel of how it feels like to be living in a container
then because I feel that we're the type of people who actually stay up night to just talk about anything also so can we at least like keep a limit we we keep it like three then we sleep like
five hours no need go gym in the morning lah I rather gym at night also I think we're all gymers at night
okay okay so
ya lah like you imagine we play
um musical chair but this one is musical container
then like you run one round right then maybe me and haizat play first like whoever we scissor paper stone then one person go out then we chase you then after that one round I go back in then haizat
we scissor paper stone and then
okay what I can feel because today we gym at nine right
the waking up is quite a
quite a weight ah
and not only that right eh how do I feel when I woke up um
like quite ons to start my day leh
is that
did I shower after I gym oh ya I did I did I did shower did I I did
I did
I'm a clean
human being
oh wait um so after after day one what what what's day two
no no I can already tell where this is going
I think it's town area
okay but if we're
just
instead of grabbing there just take public transport lah I mean like not that one hour journey and uh and uh how how much is that twenty six dollars I I I think one hour journey I I mean it's it's okay
um okay lah I get okay you know what how about
I am so ons if we're just going to stay in the container all the way so I mean this going out thing is actually haizat plan eh
wait wait do you want to go out of the container I already ask you that but I feel like I already know the answer because I know you
okay wait but we can we can go outside if we
how do I say if the places are nearby lah but if the place not nearby then I can we have a second suggestion cause I'd rather the place nearby
and
I haven't I've never went past gold like I know like I know my limits
mm but
I think we can one one place I know is cow play cow moo which is quite near one of I mean eh no no that's promenade right
I take it back I don't know where is one-north is what is my workplace all we have is laboratories
I don't know I don't know
if you go by circle line then far lah cause like one-north promenade is like other end to other end leh
I but I think the journey is like forty five minutes max
we talking about food are we going to cook all the way I would rather cook all the way I mean I don't mind eating maggi
I mean come on samyang man I mean uh
no brainer answer samyang all the way to cook samyang
that's like
if aliens were to find me or catch me they open up my stomach they're just going to find samyang no those are not my intestine those are my samyangs
wait where am I going with this so besides samyang what else to eat are we going to eat all the way inside or are we just going to cook
once in a while some more maggi is like
haizat don't even eat spicy so
even maggi is quite limited for him
oh ya Mcdonald that's like the only cheapest food that I know and it's really nearby
one-north
yup okay
so I think food wise should be fine some of us will go shopping before that
yes and we're going to fight over what movie to watch eh if haizat were to pull that lady gaga movie I have no words I will I'd rather watch
weak lah
you all don't watch cartoon I watch cartoon oh wait you watch winx club
I'm so glad I'm not the lowest at the bottom of the food chain
tasteless
oh wait I just exposed to other people that you are watching winx club that's right siti farhanah
watches winx club and she's twenty four years old guys
eh since when I say I watch spongebob I don't watch spongebob I only watch their memes
they are meme materials
and that it's acceptable
I will roast you from hell to back
I can go all the way it's okay no it's it's it's for it's fine if you want to watch my little pony by these people who watches my little pony they are there's a certain
there's a how do I say there's a this weird weird
um group there were just uh my little pony and err I don't think ponies are supposed to doodle stuff so ya I'm judging the that specific group that those they do note that that's not horseback riding right there that no no no no there is something else
no no no it's not the cartoon it's the people watching the cartoon they changed the cartoon and made it inappropriate that's what I was talking about
okay so I guess that's the end
uh
oh ya we haven't do our staycay

but it's not really budget what it's okay lah
ya
it's
in singapore
nobody is going to stare at your body lah
well to be fair since you so paiseh I was like drying my hair so nobody got time to stare at you
so weird and you covered the frosted glass with clothes
so weird
okay we're going to go have like err chicken rice lunch are we still on for chicken rice lunch
ya but we cannot chope seat and it is if if it's like lunch hour it will be
and then the angsty err
no the
are you sure he's the same age as us what
but he work
he even even when you order with your nice friendly face he already serve you that dulan face
annoying sia he's going to give you even more dulan face with the just the eyes he's gonna give you the
no but he is really like
I don't know before we wore mask right it's like constantly you you will like want to scold people with that face with the err I don't know he's but lucky the food nice so that's why people go there like you know ah the person is like the the nephew or eh no no the grandson is not friendly but die die must try the chicken rice so we queue lah
ya ya
ya ya
ya
really
ya because you have to eat and everybody is staring at you from behind you
ya
cannot talk cock during lunch cause everybody is watching but okay lah
we
was it we dabao
no before we came before we ah err
I
ya ya
ya so is like
err what's that called it's nice oh but the indo food there is not bad also after
because she want to step healthy
on anyway recently she started walking ten err ten every night or every day she's trying because that day she went doctor and the doctor say she needs to adjust her cholesterol or there's a possible heart attack in don't know how many years lah so she she scared already err ya
so had try lor try and walk err ten ten ten everyday if not like ya
but I think the funny thing is right I think when you reach that age ah then you look back at your at your food intake
I don't think she's someone who eats fast food leh she
no she has um err high high bad cholesterol
but there's only now what right like
last time he got juggle his intake meh
exercise ah
ya because he works in that kind of environment
no but before that like for the first thirty years of his life not really right
like before this like you now they are forty mah like the first thirty years of his life is like
they got they got like
uh really like watch what they eat or just like
ya that's true
okay that one cannot I I very scared to go for like I'm very scared to go for those kind of checks it's like
ya
but but cholesterol is one thing when if you hit already right you exercise rigorously like crazy right it will still not go down that much
is it's different from phlegm and the amount of fats like cholesterol is really the build up like in your heart vessels so yup
mm
oh he cannot take because of this but he's fit what
ah okay okay
ya
wow okay that is quite sian cause like I see him exercise so much and err workout so much and then
ya sugar sugar level quite easy to maintain one as long as you watch what you eat everyday and like take all the sugar free stuff lah because like even in in coffee tea milo all got sugar what so ya
but I think cholesterol I don't know ah don't know what ya
even if they give you meal plans right is to maintain it like for you to magically lose the
ya
oh shit
you mean all this while he go visit the doctor they never give him meal plan
because my cousin went to the polyclinic right and because they they review her every three months or six months right they actually gave her suggestions you know without her actually requesting for a dietitian they are like okay you eat this eat this at this timing because I think they feel like maybe after the first uh like time gap review right maybe the change not much
so I think that's like why wow there's so much toys okay that's like me digressing but oh ya oh wait I I just side note that day I was eating lunch alone right and there was this lady she was err what's that called ah
with like I think is a vegetarian meal lah so like
no like err there's err you know like those kind that looks like mala but I don't think it's mala it looks like err it's soya sauce so it has like
ya everybody now want to be in err healthy lifestyle err why is it called drink coffee Instagram-mable life
okay and why you making some mentioning names nope
but yes everybody wants to fit in all the healthy healthy lifestyle
no if you don't take photo it didn't happen so you must take a picture to prove that you went to the gym
that's one err ya I think for us when we look at it it's show off right but I think for me I don't do it cause I feel like if you start showing once you have to show more and then
ya and I and then we also realise that we have some friends who like who like workout but then they still eat very sinfully so like the difference also not much so like people will know that's the thing about displaying your life online it's like
if you go out and then like like for example go staycay then you take video then people will be like eh bo jio
no when people when people jio you you not like you will reply what
ya
not you lah I mean like other people people alamak
didn't get it
ya so like that's the thing about promoting like life online lah it's like everybody
but then some people will your life like
crazy it's scary lah if you ah used to crazy people I think you'll be quite scared
ya I think it's just me but yup
ya we are not we're not gonna buy any Rolex to show off but yes after that we err
err
no the dress that I show you the the black and white dress that I show you yesterday
the swiss dot err
aiya
ya ya but but I don't know whether I should buy I've been staring at it it might sold out and then I will regret and then I will be very sian because I miss it ugh
it is it's available but it's like ugh
but I don't know which colour cause no colour nice and like can is those generic colour so it's like aiya
ah yes it must not be cause otherwise
err so it's like must must confirm plus chop must be like for the black one can wear when we go out but then for the white one maybe wear to like wedding
err thirty eight ninety thirty eight ninety the top is thirty four ninety but minus ten percent so it'll be about hundred for three
no I want to buy the top and the white and black dress but it's like a lot ugh
err in the last one month I don't know I mean maybe in october dude now is what month december it's december already
but I buy and can keep mah
same
not not about options or design eh like size like
ya ya
so just suck thumb ah
ya just
no lah it's not that it's not that jialat what
it's still colourful
I feel like now is the time to buy clothes because I feel like if in three to five years err if I settle down I think no such thing as buying clothes so maybe now I should buy
no I I think you really have to rethink it because shag like so many things to pay for like the increase in terms of bills that you have to pay will be quite significant so quite
I
nope shag spend so much money
only choose one ah
for me
I think
no
I think
ya I think the reason why I buy buy clothes is because I feel like I'm the kind if I like it and I can keep it for long I I really can keep it like I have some clothes there like don't know how many years old ya so it's like it's really
I feel lah if you buy clothes and if you can stay stay in your shape
ha not so jialat like expand too much right err then you can wear your clothes for quite a while just need to look after them
ya but then if you buy and then never wear buy never wear then some people buy really a lot
but okay at least I'm the kind who don't buy very expensive clothes but I rather buy more not so expensive ones like I won't buy a two hundred dollar dress I'll buy like three three items for hundred so it's not not so bad
cause people who buy like
very expensive one is like oh my god it's just like too expensive
and it's like
actually
thirty dollar dress and two hundred dollar dress
it doesn't really look
much of a difference
ya
okay
ya and
oh let's go see err universal traveller the winter shop
I don't know where we can just go lah walk down the road are we still going to the rich and good cake shop
yes ah
huh
ha he wasn't even breathing yesterday ah ya and he said he's not sleeping but I have a feeling he slept what nonsense want to fix circulatory system
no dubai is in parkway east hospital since that time he was admitted he didn't
and he's like I I ah the parking for bike is free but I'm just worried they will clamp the bike thinking who park the bike for the end over there
will it be towed away
okay I'm gonna tell him
no I think the nurses know I think the doctor ask him the doctor say err are you confident to ride your bike then he's like maybe not I will take a cab home
ya ya so so so the doctor told him like ya you can take cab home from the hospital
this one need to clap clap for him cause he just like bring the bike and leave it there I don't know how long already
seriously
apparently the neck still pain eh he's like he said there's this weird feeling I'm like what is weird feeling it's like I don't know it's a bit weird I'm like huh but it's one week already and it's not even an invasive treatment why would your neck be aching more uh like one week after when it's just supposedly an injection
no that's the thing I don't know when is the follow up err follow up appointment the uh I don't know
anyway now he probably quite kanchiong no haven't kanchiong yet because he will only kanchiong like literally twelve hours before the exam he has two papers one on wednesday one on thursday
that's why he actually he very busy so that's why he say uh we go buy cake after your exam I'm like nope I'm gonna go but it today unless the cake don't have an ya if the cake don't have then I said sad okay lah then we we we buy another time
I am looking forward to T box I want beef

ya it's like you staycay in town to have fireworks in the neighbourhood it's quite
really but cannot see fireworks what from orchard
ah ya lah but you know like
crazy siao like the the there there's this err new hotel called laguna work err it's a golf club lah so it's new
uh near EXPO like somewhere behind EXPO it's a golf club ah ah err so I was checking when they first open I think the room rates were three hundred plus to four hundred then I'm like that's expensive right
and then I check again it's six hundred six hundred
I mean fullerton bay six hundred is like okay but because fullerton bay is like in the middle of the is it called singapore river ya singapore river or sea whatever lah and err
what's that called
but this one six hundred golf club also got no view okay lah
eh but it's quite near EXPO and all the what's that place called ah changi city point
ya
no it's a is it hotel ya gold club ah ya like resort ah
why as in
uh ya
please lah crowne plaza changi is four hundred fifty for normal room
uh ya but also now no planes fly as in very little not like you can watch
what
but I wanna see cause the room looks nice you
okay I just like then I already see all the hotels in singapore
is like
ya it's nice leh but like aiya I'm not gonna spend that much that much money on one staycay six hundred can get us a very fancy hotel for three nights in thailand so
did we successfully launch the indonesian travel bubble
cause I know the hong kong one they stopped because of the
ya the surge in cases but I think the indonesia one and because I think the once they allow travel business my boss might want us to travel so I don't know
like I think she ya cause we opening the office in and obviously thailand is a standard one lah a
what we opening office in but they're gonna use err they are going to use a section of the generally insurance office to like cordon off and use it lah
but is
it's very slow it's really really slow and like we don't know how whether it's all done or not lah
eh I don't know how they manoeuvre it like I mean like when you open err an office in a country where you don't know anything and the system then someone language
above table under table whatever lah wherever
ya but once we once okay lah not once we can travel but when we can travel we should go to a cheap place in thailand ons
ah okay lah not immediately maybe you have to wait until like err I guess three
three six months after it's clear although I don't think so leh they say leisure
that's the thing that means they under report
no it's like how trump says if we don't do more tests we will not have more cases
so there's
ya
and also for countries like thailand and indo right it's it's worlds apart like the people living in the city and the people living in the villages you wouldn't um like if you don't get tested then okay lah basically you don't have
so it's like okay so it it it's like closing your eyes like okay come I I ah you say you never test okay so you just declare thirty cases okay we clap for you you got thirty cases but really you all are not wearing mask you all are not tracking people you're not you all are not like controlling the movement so
do you really think he has little cases
but in countries like okay technically in lah like it's bad right but I think it's bad in the in the is in the major cities but like
like in places where are you
ya the the the the conservative people like
ya
you know that more than five million people travelled right
I think more than that because also has about what five hundred and twenty million people
that that day pedi said at that point when she talked to me there's at least five million americans on the planes flying throughout the country to visit their family
and then there are some people even on Tiktok you know like Tiktok videos they're like they're like all kinds of people making videos what's so there are I follow a bunch of all these like doctors who make like Tiktok videos about medical stuff like free what to watch so like they um what's that called they were saying like err please do not travel and to minimise the spread ah the healthcare system is really quite drained but they will do it in a dance you know like make it fun that kind of thing but people don't care
they don't care it's natural selection at err it's best no nature selection natural selection
ya correct ya natural selection right because it's like
you you're not scared
but then again singaporeans who are kiasu usually err kiasu kiasi don't want to lose out and also scared die but but also go out and crowding the malls so I don't know
but you will immediately be fined what not meh
chey they were not they were not like removed from our country
I thought it's like quite a high amount and no jail meh like no no jail like
aiya whatever
I mean if you want to make sure people follow then you need to have a more serious
it's like how
the india one ah
no but look at
isn't it like err what for littering or smoking can't they write it's either five hundred or six months jail usually you know on the on the
ya
we have offices and we work in offices and offices not very small what even with the with the alternate grouping it's still more than five what
so you wear mask at all times at your table
ah that's good because
ya we have to wear mask at all times then we even ask like huh but we one person what what if today I'm in the office alone in the as in in the room alone lah I still must wear mask at all times
well
I guess I don't know is just like
that's true have you seen
the rest never mind lah
ya so it's only it's only the it's only the that one
eh the the the khatib new err playground four level you wanna go but then it's like
khatib SAFRA ah ya the one uh jason went the the
HomeTeam khatib HomeTeam at khatib I told you before
uh ya but uh maybe not not when uh got menses
okay that one ons although I think I reach there I will be too scared I'll be screaming
what show your what
climbing away from responsibility but people can always arrow you more
nope once people arrow if people shoot so many arrow you you you
what the hell you you people arrow you at work you skip skip skip
err okay
okay
if you say so
that is not that is different lah I think you next time shouldn't
no
you ya you really cannot spoil market I I think the slightest sign of you caring for them they'll be like oh you're so caring I'm like what the hell
err
but some of it is some of the questions they ask like quite kaypoh what no meh
seriously
okay cause like if if
is it the fat boy anas
see that's why you have all these people writing in on like chinese page about how
not every wife wants to play game what
who is asking who like the
orh it works both ways
no what that's why if both parties have to have their own ah
so they
but
they don't talk during the game there but you
ya so wait you can hear you can hear them talking to their kid in the background while they're playing the game
okay
ah ah
ah
ah
okay
orh ya lah
okay
that is like what okay err
eh but surprisingly leh the SIM card that I got in turkey like when we drove for that god knows how many thousand kilometres it work
ah
ya
ah
ya
huh
okay
ya because the turkey SIM card was not bad leh I
ya you know what my brother tried my brother mind game with like how you play I don't know what he play lah we the a friend in singapore on the freaking van ah
he's like okay I'm gonna try and play games see whether the reception can or not I'm like can't you don't be crazy why you playing game when you're in turkey on the road and he's in singapore
yup so I think maybe you might do that if you go road trip
ya and the reception is terrible what like it will be unstable so like
ya lah you play you play for a bit you sleep for a bit and then you see how it is lah
ya
it's like oh I schedule a pap smear
I think in december I don't remember and also like err what's that thing called ah
flu jab
why ah
oh are they gonna rip me apart
oh
huh
what
no no I went to the toilet
but then again kan when you think about it kan err
I think
I I think
err you know our body has muscles there so technically it can stretch if you not forcing it like to stretch it ah
at your vagina or cervix
okay
okay fine that one government subsidy government government paid a bit right
government should pay full not pay a bit
err oh my god
ya the older people all have lah
oh ya ya the fibroid
right and then after that I'm like
ah
ya ah
everybody thinks like oh this person single mum is it
ya
siao lah
a spotify or
ah
ya
eh I talking about this um
I don't know whether I told you but err so like uh I watched Tiktok videos right so in america teenage pregnancy is very common right
they'll conceive at thirteen
they will give birth at fourteen
but the thing is
ya I like why would you why would you be why would you give birth at fourteen okay lah but I think the is a big country everything is possible
why what you mean what education
maybe people don't have money to buy condom
huh
what if the saran wrap drop out into the person's body
ee but then it has no rubber at the side
ya
so it's like
oh no you did the surgical thing but now you are pregnant
but it's just like I don't know it
err ya is a big country everything is possible not like
not like singapore like you'll be probably damned in like you don't get help and everything
what had he gain
catch ball
next time just catch the ball don't catch the sperm

the exams are like cut off about
exam are replaced with err graded assignments
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday ah ah
you design tau like
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
ah
hmm
um
but you know what uh I had this one senior the internship was during the period yes so
no
zoom or ah microsoft teams
oh she is uh in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
ah work from school even internship eh ah ya from home I mean
ah so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
and like even but then right
but then during period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work what
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that what
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then um
actually diff races okay lah
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma ah outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
oh my god
oh you mean secondary school or what
oh primary five then I still in the kindergarten lah
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay ah
but at that point of time I was
I
messenger
true lah
eighteen oh ya
hmm
why is this class not like taking it seriously
not something to be like
like absent for like out of five days leh
three days absent and and even if he was present
he didn't do anything
uh ya so even the teachers know that ah anytime like they had to
no this is like monitress other student monitor cause the monitor doesn't even come
became the prefect then the useless
they like serious lah
like to be honest for me right
I took
and it was the major presentation and it was like err for my grade it was forty percent
it was during secondary four it was during secondary four but then um
for that grade I got a
then um
I don't know like
all of us became much closer
so but for you
like since you already like from primary secondary diploma in uh
poly diploma in uh arabic private school so
passed by
no I think I was too young to remember that
oh oh ya ya yes
vanguard
vanguard ah vanguard
oh
oh
but then how do they split the class like academic results or just randomly split
ah because for my primary school like
like they like
ah separate into our six six
I don't label myself as antisocial
okay
was it a few people or just like
that one person one girl a group ah
oh she put the blame on you you haven't told me this about it
then what did you do
they put the blame on you
no like do your classmates suspect you as the
oh oh okay okay
oh no
oh
then issac was six
oh primary six oh oh but I thought you had someone who you knew
from primary six
okay
varsity jacket
oh that clip okay
so you had to like
oh
and there was this one time it was the it was the guys ah
I mean like canteen
so suddenly we saw someone running to the school gate
they got
it was a punishment
oh ya
like quite
oh ya
I think because right oh my god
oh the exam is in school
oh my god
at someone else right
no I had the same experience because ah during secondary three or secondary four I help with the book sale
so we had the books arranged at the lah so it was only like the four of us
that that lah
suddenly we were like folding something
oh no we were rearranging books to like
make sure that this section is for secondary one secondary two secondary three secondary four
then suddenly we like
no one is at school except for the admin staff and even the admin staff only no it was the other side
ignore this then we just ah started to talk again lah then we heard it again
eh
oh that is actually something ah
um
oh at that time you just ignore certain things ah ya ya
serious
um
retreat ah retreat
oh okay
oh I remember
it was like the wallpaper like for photos photo booth lah
oh google google
no one no one
err
is at the end of the pasir ris park
I avoid
oh I remember there was this one time okay ah so ah during one of the secondary three secondary four
we had like stay back ah so this was during lunchtime it was on a saturday so lunchtime
toa payoh interchange to buy food so it was left with only like a few people so like around six of us
so we played the was it werewolf or
what colour does this place have the most something like that so we played we played we played so by the end of the ten minutes or something we had to guess lah who is the spy lah
suddenly like all of us like no it's not us it's not us it's not me not me so we played that was like the fifth game so after the fifth game like eh who is it who is it because then we all showed our phone ah none of us is the spy then suddenly
ya it was a mixture of guys and girls lah so so it was like five six of us so we like
how about we go out from this classroom because like even before that right
we heard something lah at in the class it was a second level
so you were like
this one turkish horror movie
ah ah
eh I thought you internship first
oh okay
march lah
february march february lah
february I think february
shaun the sheep
oo ah
the contrast
hide and seek
oh
wait wait
which terminal
what
right now serious
so uh I was sitting beside her actually my my table is like the other end lah
standing
and I asked her lah
okay lah then I ask my friend lah are you sure like is he still there then she say ya from just now like from the thirty minutes from the starting of the class then I was like no can you see him clearly then she say ah
the shadow
eh nat
I cannot see him
then she was like
ah
okay then for that next thirty minutes right I just
but then
that kind of thing happens so I was like okay okay okay I don't want to see anymore then I was like just praying that
window
ya ya um
oh you in that level ah
ya
the corridor ah
oh

so what did you do in school
okay you can talk in english you know
ya it's just a mix
mmhmm and then
what module was it
do you like it
companies sustainability what is that
mm
oh that's interesting well at least you're learning something that you can apply I guess
I mean what can I do with engineering
yay where did you go
no but the fact that you guys celebrate like monthsaries
when was when was the last time I celebrated my monthsary mm
last time we didn't even celebrate I mean okay ever since
after our anniversary like me and mirza
how was my day mm today
it it's just consultation I didn't know that it's
an optional class so basically I just went all the way to ngee ann for nothing
oh my goodness I'm so sorry but I hate how ngee ann is being placed
like
that is so tragic like that school is so tragic
it's so far oh my god the walking distance I mean singapore poly wasn't even that far
it's just right in front
I ate ramen
with my uni friend cheryl her name she very nice err
we ate ramen at the beauty world food centre it's so good
it was only seven dollars and it was a
it was um big bowl
so basically like they had free upsize for ramen and it's only seven dollars and like you'll get a whole big ass bowl of ramen it's so good you need to go there
err when I came home I went to watch Netflix this movie oh my god kristina you need to watch this movie it's so funny it's called night school

forty five dollars for two cheesecake actually it's not bad eh is it only these two flavours
oh got what flavours
mm okay
anniversary
you just celebrated your fifth monthsary
one hour we need to talk
ya
okay I have some interesting questions about you so is like um like some question prompts ah that they came up with
so like this question
um
what is the one thing that you wish was free
what do you wish like
what could be something that that you wish was like something that you you cannot like pay with money
why
oh my god period
uh huh
do you feel like your expenses mostly
you will take that
okay I have to agree with you on that one I feel like
um clothes is unnecessary honestly
ya but food anything that you need to survive basically food
water shelter
yes
I agree okay then another one they ask
what is the pettiest reason that you dislike
that you would dislike someone pettiest reason mine is I cannot
like action know it all
like I think that is a pet peeve for me
an instant turn off ah basically or a different mindset than me ya
but I'm open to to educate them you know what I mean
if they're open also lah it goes both ways
okay you
boundaries
people
err lays
oh yes
oh ya ya ya mm
ya ya
action lah
ya okay
no he had to sleep early today
um
ya both our two boyfriends are in army right now enlisting
okay what
okay um
I feel like okay personally there won't be any of this
like buildings technology gadgets all of this nothing
it's true right we won't have anything if you think about it we're all that people are just working to just build all of this
so what will we do
what humans will do
I think we'll just rot eh
okay
ya there's no system lah for them to
ya
they just don't understand the value
it actually ya disciplines us lah in a way
mm
ah I think that's yes
hey
hey
the other flavour
you lying I thought there is akmal
oh girl
so there's a lot of malay guys
ya that's the thing about guys you know like they
because I'm in engineering course for the past few years then I noticed like guys
they rather be hanging out with like you know their own species like guys ya ya
like
I mean honestly okay if you are
if
like if okay if it's if it's female dominated would you like um include the guy in your group yes right
we have a lot of
but it's okay I have other friends too
hmm

but then I suggested her lah because the boyfriend is

on Shopee the template
ya isn't it cute then inside like there's this small box
for my riding theory test
I think I told you like I missed it
like it was yesterday I thought it was today apparently I booked on the wrong day so
yesterday I didn't go so I missed it so now I need to wait for nineteenth december
to take that theory test
ya that's the thing I have to wait until nineteenth december to take that test before I can book my which
I was so mad at myself
okay that's true
don't you feel like you
no the shoes that you bought that we bought
are you go are you going thrifting any time soon
I want to I want to explore like other thrift shops
like you know there's TikTok girl she goes on to several
like thrift shops in singapore some in geylang some in

you know rosie
so cute
the first girl she talks too much
um
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
no you close your eyes
you open it after you kiss
oh so that's from your perspective
okay I would get like
a good body for certain reasons
if you
were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
oh period
why you copy me
I won't get it I will just stick to mala
so everyday you're eating like different
ingredients but still the same base
I like I like I want to try mexican food though
like authentic ones
my friends in school like now school
like I've been talking to
like some of them like
having daily conversations with them on Whatsapp
he's twenty four this year so basically like he went to the he like he went he went to the route lah
so his life is basically like just moving around you know like
he lived in um abu dhabi then he came back in singapore he lived like multiple
houses in like through singapore like from the west to the east to the north
ya
then now
you know his his life is just so interesting because he
he does a lot of things and he was from then he keep he keeps telling us about like his stories
ya I told you before like he's the he's pretty short for a guy then after that like
tease him
ya and no the thing is that he was telling us the whole story then like you know guys being guys
like
but for him I feel like
he's more of a emotional kind of like softy ah I would say
ya he's a nice guy
then um I
mm
that one zul then I have like this study group
um there's
there's a total of six of us four four guys then two girls
like me and the cheryl girl lah then the the guys
one is one is a mix of japanese indian
but he knows how you talk in malay like
damn good damn fluent
then I ask him at first like eh you sure you not malay ah cause he looks like malay also
like from from my first impression then he say no
I I chinese indian japanese I
like
he's so ya but
sad lah because the the parents divorce so like he didn't really get to
mingle
what
green
what happened to it
thank you I want Nalgene please
ya because that that bottle
that bottle is basically a Nalgene
no I don't care it's only ten dollars
aww
so who's water bottle are you going to borrow now
exactly that was your water bottle
what happened to the pink Nalgene ah it's missing also
ya the hot pink was mine
mm
oh then one of my guy friends like
he very funny ah but like suddenly he
he said guys I'm tired of this
err life he he was talking to us like face to face ah like guys like
every single time we meet him he would always say wah I cannot I really want to drop out but then in the end he really dropped out
like one day before our maths test
and he's so funny
that's not even pulling through it's not even one semester
oh my god like
ya ya ya ya
he said like wah I really cannot take it
like it's always at the back of my mind he said like dropping out
and like some more he but okay lah he's job hunting
but the fact that he wants to work as a swabber
at his own like part time place it's just funny but
no like it's something for him to start up with lah
but
let it go just like that
so wasted lah
ya I mean that's my motivation that's my only motivation
as of now
I should have studied culinary arts
according to my friend he said that his friend
is studying culinary arts right now
in so what they do is that every single day
they have to cook and they have like
like their modules um module grades are based on how they perform lah
in the kitchen like their conduct
all of that
whose that
waalaikumusalam
sasun you want
he was out with his friends
cycling
from where
but you get tired from socialising from your boyfriend
being socially present and active
does it mean that it's hard for you to
to build a conversation with them or you rather like you just rather not
there's nothing wrong with that what
oh it's not a stereotype ah it's actually a real thing
I think engineering school is pretty mute
discussions for every tutorial oh my god you know
oh my god
my tutorials are just paper
on paper it's just assignments ah basically
I'm so fed up with my programming group
that guy was really
like putting up a fit man
like his attitude was just oh my god
like because err one of my group member
like he action do
but in reality he doesn't know lah but he's the type of
person who believes that
whatever effort you put in is you all going to be worried I don't care about the grades
then I'm like here thinking no I need the grades because that's the only point I mean that's the only
reason
like why I want to hire someone else lah to do the code then he say no he doesn't want
then in the end we cannot like proceed with the hiring ah like outsourcing because it needs the
like mutual agreement what
in the group
so it's just
me and cheryl against him and another guy
oh my god
ya so he said it's okay if we get C
man like at this point
ya
and now he's doing uh the code all by himself
I don't even know what's going on you know programming computer programming ya
that's part of engineering
to what colour
no at this point my hair is dying
no I just don't want to
like you know now is already dry
don't you feel like when you're when you're
when your hair is coloured like it's very fragile
dye your hair no you liar
so there was something lah
do you regret
if I were to dye my hair
I'd dye
I want green man
there's just something about green
depends on what shades though
oh that bright one ah I prefer the
very is dark
but it's on a lighter shade
hmm
poor man
ya very often
I mean we don't really like celebrate it celebrate it
it's not that special of an occasion
what's that
mother dough
what do they sell croissants
is it like is it better than that tiong bahru bakery

inhumane
ya true
ya
ah uh uh
balance or not
um
mmhmm
wood bag or something
mm mm
mm

ya okay
so
um not mine hers
it's about a situation
so basically she she is confused if the guy that she's talking to right now is just a friend or someone that she is she is willing to pursue
until they die
okay you talk talk talk to me okay talk to me
so okay so what happened is this fella send him a photo okay so let me just talk to you okay cause I scared they will like not accept us if we talk to them so okay so number one
please accept me
portrait malay portrait of you
oi if he send you a portrait
it's sus it's very suspicious
any human being that were to do something that is out of the norm
that is going way
bro has he ever met you before
at that point of time no so we we shall stick to no okay so
ultimate red flags a normal person will say hi
not send you a bloody picture
you've never met him before how why is he investing so much time sus sus that is sus
have you ever ask him have you done this to another girl before
a lame ass will do that I'm sorry straight up
um cancel the recording
exactly let's be real if
okay we had we had a very bad history where we were at uh one of our lowest point of our lives where we we we don't really um
check and um keep ourself in check in in terms of morals but that is in the past you've used guys before okay so don't act as if you don't even
feel like it's very weird for you to do something without even knowing them fully
you see a damn guy you like their attention but you don't want them what the hell do you do go above and beyond because you don't give a shit about the feelings correct
why is this fella going above and beyond when he doesn't even know you that is red flag because that means you don't even you go with
head first
without thinking about the qualities and stuff like that
has he ever dated before
the fact that you're not mature enough to understand that relationships can go downhill quickly and you still
desperately want to go into a a a a a
not you the fella the fella the fact that you've already
the fact that he was already in a relationship before yet he still not cautious
to be in a relationship in his future relationship that explains a lot where is the maturity
I take my time also but I I
you have to put that shit aside bro
why you talking about him okay K K K K
then make friends
have fun
wah ya I can vouch for that
ya actually you're not interested
mm
am I right to even assume if this is how he's behaving right now
if
and if if this is like a uh continuous pattern
where if you all fight you want to settle with that kind of guy
correct so do you want to make the same mistake
babe
correct so
baby girl
but
listen first stop first he's the first guy that you've ever asked out to ask to go out and then secondly
bullshit
I ask you simple
pressure
but that's the thing I feel like if you've used people before you should already have that confidence
understand what I'm saying to be smart about it I'm your friend but I'm hitting on you
no you know that that's that's how life is what okay so life is don't judge me I I'm right so if you think I'm wrong keep your opinions to yourself I'm kidding no as in
this doesn't match he takes his time knowing someone he sends a portrait to someone doesn't make sense
if you take your bloody ass time you already invest so much and and he
you know the games lah bro
can okay no no no no no
this is one of the major mistakes that most of my friends make
you date someone you know nothing about them once you start dating them when you already
you but you're you correct is good that you're not dating them but you never you're not even getting to know them
no getting to know them in terms of how do you deal with relationship not about the family and stuff like that
because that don't mean shit some people out from like fucked up families but they still know how to handle relationships and how to prioritise that and also
ya that's why I tell you be a friend once you be a friend the person is vulnerable enough you are not
you are the piece of shit in the no you
denial
stop the recording
understand or not
ya understand you just that
do you hear the crickets
taking it slow
that's why you just all out flirt
a lot of flirt
please lah muslim or not as in if you are or not the the
no correct no I'm not saying in terms of flirt when you're with him touch here all these that's the fucking boundary but if if you are texting show that you like
understand show that you like
say just say listen if that that's what I'm saying people
tend to think that if you are my friend I treat you differently
how the fuck do even become your friend then no listen listen no you listen
when you talk to him like a friend that is when you get to be your most vulnerable self
that is a playful thing correct
but at the same time it will bond you guys together because he has affirmation that eh she loves my company
that means I'm I'm I'm secured enough to just bring it one step forward so you're not even doing that you dumb-ass you're not even texting him
that you send a portrait ya it's weird
ah see lah all the bullshit all come out
cannot cannot cannot they say cannot be distracted mah so you pull out your memory cannot cannot nevermind it's okay
exactly why are you talking as if you are his girlfriend
what that is how you talk when you're want to see how is that
what
what you talking about
correct because I don't want to fuck you that's why you no no don't don't later they will disqualify us listen this what I'm telling you
you just like what I say use your flirting skills when he say that kind of stuff
when he say that kind of stuff that is when you should tell him
it's a joke right if you say I'm just his friend but you know deep down you've ulterior motive correct so
you say that shit when you are in a freaking relationship you sound like a married woman
who the hell says that
to what to your thoughts ah denial
even if you're in a relationship you wouldn't fucking say that you will say that I think we should plan a day that is special for us and just go out cause I know you've been very busy
you don't just say I know you're busy lah so it's fine K stop oh shit that means she doesn't want to talk to me
you know what I'm saying that that is the flaw in you and you want say like I have I have I got you want I pull out the receipt or not don't need to pull out keep it in your damn pocket
laugh laugh some more
um
and then sorry it's just me farting
then then do some other shit lah bro like
ya ya you have to
question him why did you send me the portrait when you don't know me then after that question him do you do this to other girls before that how did you meet your first girlfriend
who else have you send this shit to we might not know for
for a fact he just play these games and those those previous girls reject him
we might not know sorry any guy who does that immediate rejection for me
no you have no self-worth if you do that you have no self-worth
shut the hell up men who are too nice manipulative
are you kidding me bro I have been manipulated that's why
huh okay K K I agree I was shaking my head just now
what you mean
in what sense is this a joke like he's he's like playful to you that that is what you mean by that's bullshit shut the fuck up go and stop stop being so fucking blinded really really
twenty twenty
expensive what
still can get blind
being a blind ass bitch
ya lah if never take care lor
ya ridiculous unless you like sixty and then want to die soon lah
I want to see the world clearly before I die so I take my last breath make sure my eye open
stupid joy I kidding joy if you are listening to this I don't mean what I say
okay going back
so don't be an idiot
ah sorry lah it's fucking sus lah it's sus very sus very very sus
ya no because to me is like you want to live in denial
if you don't like him I don't mind but you already ask him out
and not even ya like I said if ten years down the road you ask your boyfriend can I meet him your boyfriend ask how did you met meet him he sent me a bloody portrait he knows for sure this fella was head over heels for you he's not going to get you near him
no lah for what drink tea
don't be a fucking idiot you're a fucking idiot
maybe maybe that's why that's why he keep saying that like oh that's why we ah got gap got gap if you are fucking twenty three you're twenty three right if you're twenty three you have that kind of mindset who raised you
you are just
correct so why why must you say that that means you are not working hard enough for you to fulfil yourself in terms of confidence
what is it is it that you are a if he get you then what the he climb up the tier is it which is disgusting what right
like a a are you a trophy which okay I'm not saying that
then why does he speak like that
how is the previous girl let's be what is the previous girlfriend like how is she
the previous girlfriend
so how many years and when was it
eighteen nineteen is
no it's not young it's not young what are you talking about it's like
a relationship okay a question okay so how did he got with the girl how did he get with the girl
some app what app
muslim
sus
what the fuck oh my god
I've I've use it before ya so I have a strong judgement
Muzmatch is muslim
he use he use muslim one ah
okay a lot of vulnerable people
so
the fact that he
we're going to go out on dates and if I were to speak to you it's official
like there's no such grey fucking area of
hmm I'm the friend but I ask him out he's the first ever guy that asked me out so no but it's real so
that that's why to me you've went out with a girl
you've been cheated on you went on the app lah correct right
and then after that now you behave in this very desperate manner maybe because to me so many other guys don't fucking do that but obviously
him he's weird
okay so the girl is what religious also
how why and why
how can you be friends with a friend that dated you and send you a bloody portrait
who's amin which guy
okay ya what's up with him
which is still sus to me
right now it's fine listen it's fine because you're single
it's not fine once you have a boyfriend
you are giving yourself a lot of bullshit
but you're single so it's fine
can
can but
is there drama now with you and amin
okay so he got say that he's over you and he's not dating another person or did he give like some vague answer
why
so you friendzone him
so what do you like him
no back then
babe you fucking weird
you fucking weird because once you have a guy these are not your friends anymore you are just making yourself lose friendship serious
serious
then you won't lose him but you will lose other guys that you've dated before I would never let my guy
get close to any motherfuckers any girls that ever fucking went out with him
okay I'm not possessive ah listen ah okay I have my boundaries but it's just weird
let me ask you now
which is weirder bro
if you have a boyfriend
now I ask you he say okay I go out with a girl I've dated before with another girl that is there
how would you feel exactly my point you cannot be very oblivious about this thing you're going to lose friendship you are already losing it bro
you have to pick your battle choose one what the fuck
because this is my criteria to my my boyfriend
correct obviously you can say but think about the long run you're going to lose them either ways
so no that's why no that's why to me is
to me right if my I I just I give this
I'm very liberal it doesn't sound like throughout this recording but okay
when my partner were to tell me oh I'm talking to this fella um
and then after I say okay um
how did you meet her
and then after that oh through Instagram
this girl is trying to get to know me immediate no because to me
you can what is friends is if got fate make it
uh fate eh that you and this girl fucking one out of how many billion people in the entire world but you
physically met that that fella you all had conversations you all click she was there at your lowest when she was there at your lowest she gave you time
give you motivation to bring you up when you were a piece of motherfucking shit
platonically as friends
I cannot touch because that person was there for you I'm eternally grateful
you can hang but I must also be introduced and that that fella also then that's the part where where once I'm in I give the green light I meet the girl and I need to see for myself
if she has any ulterior motive because let's be real anybody that we date were
people who are possible candidates right why didn't I I date you
you are playing with fire you let your partner date hang with a girl that they dated before
you are just going to lose lose what if one day you argue with your partner then after that he go and text the girl
and then after that the girl say ya for what also you want to talk to her it's just going to add it's fucking toxic unless you become friends with the the
no no such thing as date sorry for me is bullshit because you all she didn't give you any benefit let's be real people are selfish and you know your own motives if you don't like that girl that girl probably likes you why must she even give hope to that fella
to that girl even if she date already what then her boyfriend don't give her the self-respect meh to like just cut off guys that she date before right
so the thing is you need to be and ah if you want to talk about F uh ah friends friends I got a lot of friends lan jiao lah must be one of them must be your date meh
like you don't have any workmates meh you don't you're not motivated in life
no you are single so it's fine but you already setting yourself
for hell basically because no lah it's bullshit lah if your partner do that to you I I mean you can take it meh
no because you don't give a shit
which is even more weird because but is weird because then what if you're giving him hope and
if okay a guy that I
correct and the fact that he still wants to stay when you give nos no purpose at all
so doesn't fucking prove anything like you don't give him money you don't give him time you don't give him knowledge
you make him laugh for fuck
correct correct you make him laugh you make him laugh and for fuck that just makes him even more attracted and loves your company which makes your boyfriend feel a bit what the fuck
why are you making other guys laugh especially the guy that pursued you before
so same thing if if if my guy
I'm not gonna lie I I'm I was insecure but now I don't give a fucking shit because a lot of girls
texted him like I really had to go through that shit especially when my my relationship back then was was private
I had to go through that shit and I learnt that actually
if my the
you shouldn't get angry at people who date your boyfriend you should get angry at your boyfriend for not knowing how to act if you act this way you think your boyfriend will be
the way that he get to know you is probably the same way that these motherfuckers did
he's not gonna be and this is bullshit eh if let's say you went out with this fella and with
syafiq the one that you never date what amin syafiq okay so amin is the one you date before
so if you went out with amin and syafiq okay if your boyfriend were to say nevermind at the end of the day she comes back home to me
let's not be fucking stupid humans will interfere with your relationship humans can just say any fucking shit I've met so many guys that desperately wants my hot girlfriend relationship to fucking break
so they pretend to be that guy friend that is close to that girl and then he's not not for you ah eh just break up ah
then after they get close date which is I know motive girls guys I don't
hate on anyone but if you are stupid on your actions that's the part where I have to call that bullshit eh like bro what the fuck you doing you know and I'm not saying that you are stupid obviously you're not is the guy the guy is stupid because
eh I got talk to her before I got date her before oh now she talking to that guy ah
sad or it's weird sorry it's weird
to him for him
mm ah you mm ah mm mm
because you are you trying to say that oh he's just a friend which is not like if if your partner ya you say that your partner do the same thing you're not gonna accept it
and then you want to ya lah me
that's why I'm telling you this this this fella is not a friend so you have to this syafiq eh no akim guy akim akim you need to just
play your game well just say lor like
flirt to text not to sext
to make it quick to because you don't have any balls to be like can we just date cause I know you like me no desperate motherfucker would send me a portrait so ah shit I still cannot get it out of my system
that's weird as fuck so like he
you straight up ask him you got send any other girl portraits or not
if you're not if he say like you sound like you're jealous shut the fuck up weird fuck you are the one who's fucking weird so you tell me now do you send any girl's portrait
and is not sense of controlling it's because you know
how humans manipulate and the things that they do sometimes if a guy were to slap your face they come back they apologise give you ten thousand ring you will say okay the effort is there
people go through that shit so I don't want you to be eh he send me that gift is a good gesture I can also say I send you fucking ten apples good gesture you eat that shit is rotten what right
so you need to understand I know I have three I have three boys in my house
all of them are motherfuckers back then I know all the fucking tricks that are up their sleeve it's so easy to
here's the thing
when you get close to a guy they start to become vulnerable the real side of them come out so when the real side of them come out that's easy for them to be like K chao
you know what I'm saying so if you like if you start to feel like you're agitated and you like him and you start to miss him
make it happen when you guys are dating so that when the red flag comes you are not in a relationship for you to just like if you are in a relationship you cannot let go what
but if you're dating you can let go right so
so many of my friends are ya officially dating this guy
and that is fine because we are dating mah officially you're officially dating so
ya some people date two to three people ya that is using ah but
some people that date their their their partner officially it it it gives
how to say ah people will lie to impress you so you need to be smart lah for me for me is like
at least have the sense of um intelligence when you talk to me because if you if you're trying to say that uh you are insecure or whatnot sorry go to a fucking therapist I cannot fix that
eh eh uh no if I were you
for me to find out more red flags
so
wah
still not exact
ya just ask all the fucking shit as if you are you are interested in him
if there's this intense heat where he feels like okay maybe she's the one ah like I like her morals and stuff like that and she shows some some interest to me I think I should date her
so then when once he say that and you say okay
pattern all come out
weird bro portrait the fuck
it's weird
it's weird bro
imagine eh if you didn't you don't get with him
you get with your boyfriend that is way more fucking secure
he will shit on this motherfucker bro
obviously you want a guy that chase after you but not a guy who doesn't fucking know you
what what if he does this behind your back don't know that girl fucking pretty send her portrait while he's with you
it's weird what it's fucking weird bro
I'm not trying to uh anyhow to do ah but
through the Muzmatch also
just catch up is it
this was how old
oh so his relationship was like three years ah
with the first girl
kiwek okay lah
then he got single then he dated that girl
uh huh
I need to know the timeline so initially she said that she wants this this this this they went out how many times
correct have to ask all that babe because
this will all boils down to who he is as a person so ya okay continue
no lah with the insecurities bullshit
to marry is it
but that's not the important thing
correct so number one if she were to ask you need to ask how many times did you guys did you guys went out so she already so if she state it before she went out that I want this type of guy
oh so she state it when
okay okay then
correct um so she went out with that guy not telling him the expectations
um
but whenever they go out she got say she what she like what she don't like
which is to me that is the right way to be in a relationship so if he's complaining
fucking buck up ah bro like if if that girl don't if she wants to be treated as a proper muslim I don't want to be in a in a dark setting cause anything can happen I cannot see shit I don't want to be in this uh this setting we're just together
then if you like her do whatever it takes it shows you as a person
that basic that's basic I should not applaud him for that
ya basic babe no you know why
no because you not from Muzmatch mah
right so Muzmatch I have a friend
then um
I know her standards like you need to ask ya like I like that she go go out on a date also
but fucking wary of
um uh asking parents for for take that is the norm of how a muslim
especially a daughter
so I shouldn't applaud you for that because
you put yourself in Muzmatch what you should know the criteria what as a man also you should lead your family one day then you have this kind of thing then after that want to complain you cannot complain what because if you don't get the girl then shut up lah so
deep bro because then you're just wasting your damn time
get to know him give him the benefit of the doubt
modern kind of girl where they are open-minded tau you have so many religious girls that are like you know very strict about shit
so the primary school girl still has the criteria right
so how is it different than uh if you know that she's religious how is it different
right so so ya exactly so this is the dumbest shit that people do they date first then they become friends no
for me is I'm going to use my skills to flirt and be your friend
for you to spit out every fucking shit even you're vulnerable side because when you tell me about your vulnerability then I start to understand that
um uh how do you cope with that vulnerability so if you say like I'm actually
find the red flags I I I think I'm I'm saying this because a lot of negative shit happened in my life that I just know
what are red flags and what is not
cause of the hierarchy and the how the family view me
you don't hear me saying like oh fuck I'm a malay I cannot eh shut the fuck up I can date ten fucking arabs guy arab guy once I'm up there when I'm the same level as them because that is what I want to pursue you want to get
this kind of fella you fucking fight for it you don't
at and and and even if you are fucking ugly but the the determination is fucking attractive
so like like I said all these acts of
is very scary to me scary
sending sending portrait then like you big fuck
it's weird too it's weird to me it's weird lah unless you good boy but you good boy also it's fucking lame what like
if if you put yourself out in the media
then I understand
like ya so if let's say you are youtuber or whatnot then people send stuff
I mean obviously you are gorgeous but you have to understand that
lame dudes I don't want to call him lame but I'm always right so let me just say that
did you know what I'm saying
ah so before he send you the portrait you all talk before
in real life or
message shut the fuck up then shut the fuck up then there's so many people I talk through message also and I don't give a shit that was the those are the least kind of people that I give a fuck about because I
I never go out with them you have to understand if you text a serial killer
don't know what they are serial killer until you go out with them correct
why are you putting yourself in a fucking position
shut the fuck up you already like him
this is what I want my friend to do to me also if I'm fucking blinded as fuck
legit legit portrait is already how many times I have to say I think ten thousand times in this recording ah
they need to type ah their to
ah transcript huh portrait copy paste copy paste
you like the company
but you won't love you won't correct because let's be real
for me before this also I impress all of the guys that I want to go out with
you cannot leave the mentality is that I'm a guy so I cannot whack back
chao if you're not leaving me also you don't have any self-worth the fact that I'm so into personal growth
is because that is the truth in life
in jail eh say once I get past my O levels I will marry uh and I'll once I become a millionaire I will pursue you and I will chase after you and I'll marry you men will go to that extend even me
let's be real if the person is worth it so he give you a portrait when he doesn't even fucking know you that's weird
that is what I used to what that's a fucking pattern what you know nobody changes overnight
you send a portrait you got the girl so easy that's why I tell you to play the game
like him you can like him look at his red flags once he blow you off then you know how to cut
don't waste your time you are a I mean I don't want to say you lower your standards ah but you deserve so much more
to be in this position with a guy that send you a portrait
oh whatever I'm hearing I'm sorry I'm I'm okay one thing is I'm very protective of my friends number two
I can just see shit
clearly
just now cannot lah because not twenty twenty vision mah put braces mah my eyes
they lie people lie
then you will know if you're fucking mature or not
oh maybe that's why you have a job that won't allow you to fucking um pursue a better goal
if my brother that's a dropout can fucking earn uh like maybe because
how to say ah when you've already tasted a higher standard of living you just want to work for it
one day I can assume about him benefit of the doubt is maybe he he has never tasted a better life of living maybe he don't have that knowledge he's not blessed with that knowledge so
that's why you as a you you you say you are a friend right bless him with that knowledge see what he will do with it
but at the same time like
don't settle down for what you're not satisfied with serious for me a guy I need to be like fucking like a monkey
for me to legit be like pursuing you if you make me no sorry
if if it's more of like I want to get to I really want to get to know this guy he has everything like
how to say ah for me
I'm not there yet so I don't even
I didn't even want to date because I don't want to settle for less so for me it's like looks
uh dressing and morals
then after that once I really really really really like you because everything is fine then I will just pursue chemistry
chemistry is there
if if he really likes me then
okay I think I should give him a bit more attention I really really like him but at the same time
I don't pursue guys who are fifty fifty about me because
you can like people keep saying like oh you like
I think people like to see me as like confident like she can get that guy nope is I just don't waste time with people that I know I cannot get
like must have to realistic like not like there's so many people much more good looking than me and there's so much
um like I have a lot to work on but
then if it's not enough then I make myself enough
you know that kind of thing so people that that rush into relationship are sus
sus send portrait sus
cause he's fucking fat wah fuck you chibai want to fucking look look look shut the fuck up ah want to look at my boyfriend for what
buto I cannot because but then that was when I was insecure but now when I realise that
my boyfriend has to reassure me I feel lame
because to me is I fucking sound psychotic but but that is what
people do
so if you as a man behave like a desperate fucker I cannot I cannot
if you chase after a girl as if you have no self send portrait if my boyfriend fucking do that I'll smack the shit out of him obviously you can send portraits to me if
this is weird babe nobody fucking do that nobody fucking do that I'm scared if
insecurities will come up
not you you obviously don't but if if
no what if your insecurities come out he play with it
you you can be vulnerable but at the same time just say like
oh anytime if I want to cut you off which is good lah I think you have low low tolerance also for bullshit I'm hoping ah
mm mm
correct so
in a man
and then
fuck it fuck ah
which is
correct correct
he did all the work what work need to work meh
ya isn't that good
huh
but then
ah that's fine
correct
correct you have to understand there's
I have so many hot ass
fucking girlfriends
that get with a fucking ugly guy because he's charismatic
insecure
correct insecure
I'm also charismatic how many people that I use
so many worse is you date a guy that is ugly and cheated on you might as well date a good looking guy
right so that's why to me is like
but I'm not okay I'm just throwing the worst of the worst so that you know how to react quick with fear
obviously that that that I think that's how life should be that you date someone that is
the looks
people say that looks don't matter suck my dick lah huh looks and also um
not status looks and um body language
when that is okay then after that your your
uh no no looks and confidence so
confidence might also play with the look so if you're actually fucking ugly but you have a lot of confidence because you have a lot of skills that people look up to
you're already fucking good looking already that is looks to me not just physical then after that is the the charismatic so
mm test
you gonna die
ya it's pandemic all over again
if this you choose this fella is the one that you're gonna marry and this uh and if you have to you have to teach a man how to work on his own
fuck that shit
and a man who's very very independent on on the on the on the partner uh uh toxic
you depend on the partner to change toxic
you can obviously
advise but it's what he do
so many people can rise up but it's how much they want it
don't don't need to date men
when you're in the grey area don't need to
motherfucker you just fucking told me you ask him out that's a fucking date for fucking sure bro he's not your friend
but you reciprocate
uh
this guy has other hot girlfriends at that point of time he was single okay so he was single until I was the first girl that he dated so he's good looking so a
he was dating a lot of girls
but he don't like anyone of them so if you're single you're free to be a fucking cunt what right so when
he see that girl as an opportunity to get to know other hot chicks so
when she him and saying that oh you're so cute
he's like a before me he was a fucking flirt cause he's single but he try to play off like I'm just a friend what but I know you're fucking flirt you know
before that I was I never use people before because of him I used people because of what happened then after that um
when you get close to the girl the girl obviously like like him but then he with
and he was friendzoning her because she got other hot chicks hot friends
and then that is to me is like then okay lor then I'm not that mad at the fact that you still keep in contact but at the end of the day
once he was a bit more serious with me he cut contact with that girl because he knows that I'm not happy but I told him I'm fucking liberal
going to allow you to meet her face to face and and it just gives
what like you reciprocate like it's more nicer to hear that oh
my boyfriend is the first guy that I asked out but then you should not
put so much weight into your your decisions people make mistakes if he's not the one you shouldn't be like eh he's the first guy I asked
okay
okay okay okay okay contradicting ah okay
good lah then then
you sure okay if you feel like you in denial right really make believe
make believe that like
no make believe when when when the right time so when you want to flirt with him right think of it
okay I'm your friend what so it's not wrong for me to say this but then when when after that he say some fucked up shit right
turn back and be like eh but this is the fella that I want to might want to date okay I must like attack him back
but you know you get what I'm saying like you have to play smart
spy
speaker speaker
see ah
wait ah you go ask all of this shit because like you waste more time ah then after that when you get to know after the like what one year ah wasted sia
wasted you going to be like
what the fuck you are this lame actually I could have met other fucking guys I could have hang out with my other friends
who knows he's fucking insecure for all we know
motherfucker he dated two girls that are whack the fuck
he doesn't know shit about life
stills tell me I love you on the the second time we met tell him already I won't be with you because I'm I just came out of a relationship

um um I mean
one thing tom holland is
one thing okay
he's young so he really suits it but I feel like I'm much more um what you call this thing convinced by the portrayal of toby maguire as spider man is very subjective a lot of people will be debating about this
but I just feel like at the point of time your teenager he was out there
there was this other person also andrew garfield you know
ya so um he his portrayal wasn't as good as toby maguire
like there's a lot of err
I don't know whether you understand what I'm saying but
I mean he does have the face of like
oh my god when was the last time
mulan
is it
think so
err acting ah
err I'm re-watching friends over and over again can never stop man
okay documentary
I know I heard
okay so in your own opinion do you think that that it's actually a good way of
um
mmhmm
personality personally I don't think it works though cause like okay one thing capitalism
um fridge
might not have the money to even buy groceries but in prison you have
good share though will be interested to actually watch it on netflix
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
they will be tempted ah ya should shoplift in norway
what do you mean
uh ya
oh right right right
nice
ya then after that this year
ya so ya what you buying what what are you buying planning to buy do you have any
things in your mind
um

is that is that like a trend right now because this is my first time hearing it
mmhmm
siak ah

I mean it's it's still there
not being used I mean I don't know what to use it anyway so I'm planning to like get
ya
eh
uh um
eh
worth it seh
compared to sixty
cause all this while I been seeing like sixty-ish sixty six a seventy will be like the highest but since you say ninety like you think like I should buy now
ya no get go lower
oh oh okay I thought you mean selling
sell means good lah because it's ninety right ya so its a no go
you will not have to quarantine over there or when you come here you just have to do some swab test and you can just like
chao from there from the airport
ya negative ah
ya
huh

hydro

exotic
how how much is his
damn son

I'm surprised
so what is he doing like apart from just selling plants
wow
product design
oh okay so how do you feel about that
and how do you feel about him taking a degree like
like
mmhmm
ya
I know girl
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh you went dark so fast
ya
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
sis we all struggling here ah
at least we are doing something about it right
ya and then like mine will be like birds chirping
ya
ya so like err ya so like now I'm like
as a wife or as a as it either wife or husband then you have to like remind each other to so like because if not then that would be you know your your your taiji lah basically so it's wife
we call it
where's your flaws may seems like whatever that might
what you call the thing
ya then that will be his fault
ya
ya
ya so this husband and wife thing it's it's really like teamwork
I really feel it after a year eh
being wife
communication that would be my response
communication is key definitely
because
like you assume that the other person will know
right so right you just have to communicate whether you like it or not whether it will hurt the person you can soften the blow yes but as long as you tell and communicate
and learn it the hard way
only when I met adam there I would I know the positiveness
the value of communicating
what do you mean
ya
ya
that was what I been saying
okay okay so yours is more of physical yours is more of like a err a tangible mine is
I would always say mine is intangible but mine is like
err
verbal understanding technically its intangible is more of like the vibe that you get from your husband or your wife
ya
boyish lah so I I didn't I I sometimes assume and I I I don't know what he wants ah so he have to communicate he's the girl in relationships basically lah
I think we both know that lah
ya so just tell me what you want lah so in a way communication works
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm mmhmm
okay mm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya as long ah you communicate really because like if you think like you want to run away
ya
Tiktok
ya
there is there I mean there is one
oh damn
oh
muffin mitten oven mitten
is it the rainy day
its the rainy season
wow
oh my god I'm so annoyed with this trump and biden thing
cause like err back then like like few
ya and then like I have to like nudge him and say like you know like
communicate ah if you please wear the stupid earpiece please
I am the president
when he's he's not president
jer
okay
ah
uh on trump um surprisingly ah quite good looking guy
ya when he was like younger
ya
ya supposed to go to the office today cause every monday is a calling day so err but its raining so he I don't know whether he's gonna call at home I mean technically he can call at home its just that when you are at the office and everyone is calling you will be motivated to call right
so I don't know why they do calls on monday I mean mondays got monday blue as a customer as a client would you want to be called on monday for insurance like don't disturb me on monday monday is really lousy
ya but monday
wait he suppose to call you
orh
mm mm
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
ya ya ya
oh okay
is it because it covers slightly more I don't know
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
orh okay
okay
but if you terminate
orh okay okay
oh
this is under adam or your own
I know that is doing very well right now so that's why he's trying to get like um all his clients to invest in sector because Apple is coming up lots of stuff um a lot of people will invest in that and
ah mmhmm
mmhmm
side
oh oh
oh
UNICEF ah
ah ah that's the one
what what was the question
did you google
initiate
how do you do
in your essays in secondary school
I know I know
think you should work on your timings
short form
funny though
sorry but um yes err in twenty twenty four by twenty twenty four all students will get a personalised laptop
yup
yup
so much girl
do you know about the new syllabus oh not syllabus like the new programme education program that we have right now
so basically err I'm not sure which year
so
will have their common test mid year and the year right
as of now they don't have such thing theory change
it's what we call with the assessment so they have three of them already four of them eh so they go by percentage okay some pop pop quiz pop project work
so they only have one major exam at the end of the year and that's really really high percentage which is seventy percent
that's it ah
so I do not know whether it's actually blessing in disguise for some people
a stress on kids which I don't know it kind of doesn't work lah
because I hear students say I stress
ya adulting
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
ah
its its definitely different lah cause um
it it has its own pros and cons like for both the old system and new system because the old system you have lesser weeks to teach and you have more time not more time you let's say we should because you need to set papers and they have exams you have mid year their contents they have mid year and they have end of the year
this time around I only have one end of the year so technically teachers need to set one piece of the exam and the rest is just like activity and it can be like presentation it can be group work pair work whatever work so all of this it's in to
I don't know whether you actually understand where I'm coming from but um for me if you ask me which one I prefer
as a teacher
so it's much more stressful for them
but for teachers its just set papers
if you if you if the way that you set paper is very stressful then that's on you lah
but
for me is is still okay cause
ya
uh huh
a'ah
ah
ya then they will be screwed up ah which is very common in my class
ya especially COVID this year
um I'm coming later
okay the thing is like when we wake up as a form teachers you have to take attendance so they will have to be in this like zoom call or whatever and then like
err there will always be this one or two people who never wakes up
it's like
ya and its like
ugh its still retained there in my mind so annoying
ya and
um in a way yes because like I don't have to like teach and I can chill a bit but the fact that I still have to go to work and I cannot travel cause it's the only time that you can travel right end of year to travel to like europe country um
that's it ah december holidays
I don't think you got book no book
to to to do you have the link
um mac birthday is next month she's been wanting to go singapore flyer mac
no no no I mean you can use some of it so I check already so senior citizen is like thirty something
adult is fifty
there goes my fifty
can ah
right you should be able to stack though
ten ten dollar vouchers that accumulate to hundred ya
but fifty dollars for a ferris wheel
ya she's been wanting to
oh well
um

my day um
then the queue outside to enter is so long cause right now is COVID right like you know
so the maximum number of people to be inside the store is like only twenty five
and it's black friday so
people like trying to get in so even if I tell them uh I'm sorry lah you cannot
then they just keep doing the annoyed face
but the I'm just saying ah not not not really good not a good day how about you
like I see everybody is like shopping black friday's sale so good
hmm good question
then you where where was where was your intern again
oh that's your interview I mean like when your intern start
oh cause I got part time school and
holidays is not holidays already
revise and get all the projects done
but this time is infographic but
it's better it's a group project so at least
me
mm I think I'm just like cause right now I
then but for you you I thought you studied like
mm cause right now it's not
easy to get accounting job with uh like
maybe I try to apply if I get if not what I'm just going to go maybe just administrative work
but
overseas
oh my god if COVID is over
just like
of course like I miss most is like the different
like currency you know like anything it's just anything and everything is cheaper there
like it's in singapore you know the everything is much more expensive so you can't spent that much
you have to be like save save a bit
um I don't really
have a favourite like
but I know you're more into fashion kan
so actually how about you just tell me like actually what kind of like
fashion you're into right now
like koreans are known for their skin
you know like their clear skin
and it's like actually cheaper to buy there is cause they they sell it like in bundles and like there's always promotion on their items
but I but like they are also known for their fashion but I didn't like I'm not into it so I didn't buy a lot of like their shoes or like clothing
so it was like wasted lah I I didn't also visit all their
attractions much
I'm sure you also have a dream
country to go right like what is it
wah
you like anime
wah what anime you watch already
favourite anime
mm like currently I like I find haikyu really cute like I've I've like keep up with like from season one to season four like
but thanks lah actually this kind soul actually introduced me to anime I just started I don't I don't like really
know about anime but after watching it like I've grown interest into it
mm I think it's more on like
like you know school
that kind of anime ya
I don't like the one like you know
there's one I don't know there's one kind of anime I don't I'm not really into it but
okay lah but I like anime like it's like in cartoon
cartoon but more on
in things that actually happening in real life like that's the thing like make me fall in love with anime
mm like I said I like haikyu so I'm actually into like kenma
like he's like really chill guy
ya like he was like a simple guy but he just like inside he's always like bursting so at certain time when he
instead of being quiet he he just like get angry that's when like he but he looks cute like I find it cute
ya
it's okay lah anime is like a way to like it's a getaway from like real life
hmm before anime actually I used to watch K drama like you know K drama
oh eh you heard already you never watch it before
like
mm I think I watch mm like
most of running man episode
like you know running man like be when kang gary was inside
like I don't like they are different already lah like is not the
the running man that it used to be but okay lah I still watch I still keep up with them
but you eh
hello
what year is that kang ho dong inside two days one night like now
uh K pop oh ya K pop is what makes me when into K drama and all K pop
the first thing was actually feel in love with jeong eun ji
just made me fell in love with her
favourite song from who
orh if A pink like no I listen to most of their songs like I just keep up with all their songs
there's no like favourites lah actually because all their song is nice very catchy
oh no no lah I just found it inside my wardrobe
like what is even the difference between soccer and football
huh food mm I'm not so sure lah a thing about me is I don't have like favourite favourite thing like
I like I like I don't like I don't like
like I don't know I don't believe in favourite
why you have is it
me
mm
I like I say lah like I
eat what add stuff is it
oh it's not like I don't eat
the go-to is sure McDonald's lah
oh ya talking about samurai burger right now they they they bring back samurai burger wah I was so excited during COVID cause usually they
bring out in like mid
of the year
like because of COVID they have like McDonald was close
so now that they open it they bring back samurai I was so happy like I think I ate it twice already this week
but if like their menu
I usually go for the angus burger
it's like a upgraded version of cheeseburger like you how about you what what is your go-to menu at McDonald's
at the end of the day I'll still go for like home-cooked meals
Jollibee oh my god Jollibee is a Jollibee is a filipino
fast food right
Adam's Corner
Adam's Corner
oh you suggest me to eat at Adam's Corner there
wah
then what what do you suggest me eating there
water chestnut
so actually you go botanic garden what do you do cause personally
I don't really like going there lah cause more of nature so many insects
I um my sister she used to lah she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong lah
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
if you not a if you just like um afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school haiyo
huh
wow I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try lah try to be on time lah it's school it's important
me graduate
I started school err this year april
so it's only been how many months
uh few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
hmm looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so lah
then eh you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
oh
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
mm I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside
also
then how about you you do you enjoy like your during secondary school
wow then the this club are you like serious or just like
you know like just a leisure thing
uh that time I heard you got injured because of rugby right then like for a long time you did not
get to play rugby although it's your hobby
uh no I take care of myself very well
um like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay lah since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
oh really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
oh good lah
hmm nevermind lah
like
right now oh you heard about like
uh I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
oh
it's okay lah we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
uh I really
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good lah you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
wah I really I like oh yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know uh
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
ah every month but now
like I heard like like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
oh wah everything you want to do with your friend ah then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
oh uh you heard talking about like and all you heard about like
uh government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure lah but like what it can be use for
only like certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
relax what you so stress about
wah talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like uh allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
swim oh uh have you like you know uh sentosa also there's a lot of like
uh activities to do like the luge or the bungee jumping have you tried before
height I've tried a lot of them that I mentioned actually
uh oh I used to work at luge actually I've I find luge
it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
uh trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because uh apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same lah
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
uh I think might as well you just take a train
I guess for you lah
ya maybe some things are not meant for you to do but if not you can always go to other country to try and experience it
are you sure
like
K maybe you can try lah I don't want to like crush your dreams you know
wow that must be fascinating to be as a child to know like every car brands huh
wah then what's your favourite car
but I'm just not into it like you know like
like there's interest in car no I like car I mean it
I can sit down it gets me to places with shelter
oh then you watch tokyo drift ah you like japanese car
oh the fast and furious movies is it ya actually tokyo drift all uh
is it is it too fast too furious or the fast and furious one oh I think just anything before that is nice but after
I don't like not really into the show lah
way before what don't so text me just saying you watch the show when there's paul walker
so when there's no paul walker you don't watch it anymore
nissan skyline
oh I think I heard of that car before
wah but I don't know lah I I'm I look so weird by myself like I don't have like interest
but it's weird you don't know like people always have like will be interest in cars interest in bikes
or interest in like footballs and all
ya I'm amazed that like
wah so you have been supporting that club since you were three years old
wow
I feel like that's against your will
but it's okay I guess you learn
you grow to learn the eh eh you learn to grow
hais
english is hard but it's okay I think you love your club already but is your club really good actually or you just love them
but is man U still as good as they were
wah wow
but I know lah like I like I used to hear like man U is like good but now
I don't really hear much about them anymore so like
I don't know anything but it's
cool to know lah from you
true lah you also cannot expect all good players to go into man U right of course you have to give chance to other teams to bring up their name also
are you being an haters right now like maybe right now it's liverpool time to shine
hmm interesting wow
wah I feel like wah I'm not looking forward for work tomorrow like
uh ah I also just want to relax and really just watch something I like
true
hais
nevermind I think we just have to endure a bit
get through this hard time then maybe when we're
things are easier
then we can just
enjoy life already
ya I agree
is it
rain before sunshine
but just a bit more let's let this COVID pass and then we can get back our good jobs
mm mm
ya can't wait can't wait to get like
uh like a good career and then can start saving and then we can do like we say like travel
and do the things we want
ya but it's okay lah let's just think positively for now
no need to think so much
we just do our part we focus on our
career or our education
then I'm sure things will be better for us
okay

like ya sell your package to someone else
oh
why you still continue to pay sia babe
right
oh my god babe that's a lot of money sia
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put uh a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that oh because company also need need to earn money how can you put that over a an individual's loss
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
ya you didn't get any of the products
wah I will angry sia
ya
oh you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
err like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him lah he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like oh
just like
I think it's quite cute lah like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right um the last girlfriend ah he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you do you want to be my girlfriend I was like oh so like to him it means a lot lah that he ask me then I was like orh okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
um also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with hassan
me I still have unresolved issues with hassan
ya we're still not talking tau babe
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover wah I felt like the shittiest daughter ever sia babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like ah loose threads or like uh consequences on some like those aftermath of me and hassan that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with aqil and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with aqil I want to be with aqil only and not have like oh this is because of hassan that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about hassan like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
take care of himself
I think so ah because like he was a great boyfriend sia babe only things things messed up after the relationship
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year ah
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way sia babe like
like the thing with hassan all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet aqil and this is going to happen
ya
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time ah babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and aqil
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
ya I don't know ah like
I mean I really really hope hassan
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness ah babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship lah after that I don't know what happened
right
uh after after hassan
cause you were still with audi and then like we went out remember you me hassan you me hassan audi ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so eh babe
uh like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like um cold like he's very err like
ah very action ah
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like uh when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then err he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder ah like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
be someone that they're not
then their true form comes out wah scary ah
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
ah
okay
like that would be
babe thailand the best place ya
oh ya you went with your family right
that's nice
I tell my parents I go with you
huh
ah ah
oh right
ya not your thing okay okay I get it
oh my god
bangkok is it
I think it's bangkok right
like
sorry
no lah I think you you and simon should have your time first
you guys should go bali sia babe
no like bali is is accepting like tourists at the end of the year
so you should like
eh they have they have like private villas with pools and like nice nice ass views and the food's pretty good I think you should check it out
it's just like for maybe like three nights lah you just have time for each other
just lepak with each other
oh my god they're gonna transcribe this
ya like typing it out like okay so miza um said she and aqil colon
oh right we can like
ya
I think it'll be fun
then ah
ah ya the the they were in the lot and then like aqil saw them then aqil was like eh and then he park near near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like err Decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
huh
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
mm
like his jealousy
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
firdaus is an idiot
ya
you know
we got seven more minutes
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce aqil to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like oh my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like aqil like morals also questionable
like he ah he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who who do that also
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
ya
ya
right
mm
your mum
ya
eh how's your mum is she okay
err I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
uh
most likely early next year
or mid next year
but I told him ah like my is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like oh no lah but like he wants to
then I say it's fine um like we can like plan lah like
try to understand and see other people's view ah like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with

three two one
okay hi
a'ah lah adulting kan like
ya lah
oh
I I now just studying because uh
a'ah
now it's all being put to a stop kan like temporary
okay lah um
the government got give some money then I do like odd jobs in
in between lah
ya but then now I'm more focused on like
studying ah because
so I taking up some random course ah
oh
oh ya that one a bit hard to commit lah
mm mm mm
those a bit rush kan
ah
eh I don't know sia
it's okay ah I think everyone having a hard time ah
I mean okay no maybe not everyone but most people are ya lah a'ah
mm
oh my god
oh
oh
mm
ya lor ya lor
it's okay
ya but that's the thing is now we got more free time
kind of ah except for you ah you very busy always busy eh
ya lah good lah
but then now I think I'm slowly starting to get out again ah because
no choice lah I have to work ah
ya
irritating tau that because I think best like what you said lah face to face
ya
mm
why ah people like this
oh
ha
ya ya
mmhmm
ya lah ya lah
I think it's going to go to phase three soon ah so maybe that that that then some office can open
um I heard lah I don't know whether true or not
ya recently like very small cases lah ya
ya because my my aunt also she
now uh alternate between like one week in office one week at home so at least I think that's the not that's the best idea lah
you know
so at least we gonna
oh
oh
oh
oh
tracetogether oh
mm maybe maybe
ya lah ya lah
dah lose the vibe ah
ya
ya
oh
whoa
a'ah a'ah
I did eh
oh
wah okay congratulations
mm
ya lah ya lah
I
oh
I don't like to order
uh my house not a lot of
nice food okay because
but then my family doesn't she they are very strict on the halal cert so
um ya lah then it's like when as I choose it always have to be a halal food then our halal selection quite limited so I'm very sick of the stuff that we order in already
so ya then then
ya but then if I'm eating at home then like
they will know what I'm ordering and things like that so
ya
why
jurong
wah
I I
huh
but ya
first of all you guys have three malls to eat at
right three malls
JEM
ah
oh you mean you uh okay okay you're staying at the other
more jurong side ya
okay okay sorry sorry I don't really go to the west
my my my my my life revolves around north east
so when I go to the west it's really like
west mall is it I don't know ya um
no
oh sorry sorry sorry uh JEM
what the other one
you know the three malls ya ya
ah westgate
ya lah ya lah like I forgot then I'm like I don't know man
so
really rare to meet people who stay in jurong
west
mm
a'ah
ya
hmm
not close enough ya I know
mm
then I'm like I'm gonna do baseball
ya uh then my mcdonald's also twenty four hours actually so
ah oh
oh okay ya
well nevermind lah ya at night you cook but in the morning don't cook oh but you know like because now like
eh but I tempted you know

ya
uh
mm
same same
I know oh
ah ya
uh huh
mm
mmhmm
wah
that's a bit sad
no ah okay okay
ya aww
that that's that's nice of him congrats
but ya I think it's still no rush ah I mean it's just tempting because
like what you say lah introverts then not a lot of people to invite anyway cause
my bridesmaids jer dah ten
how to uh get married like that then I'm like
I don't even think I have like bridesmaid you know
maid of honour ah that one different
ya that's why I'm like
we already planned this wedding for a long time and I have five bridesmaids then you say can only invite ten people so how am I going to go through with this
ten people I think I have eight people then the other two is just extra I have to invite because they are family you know
ya ya it's like
ya
oh
ya ya um then your your brothers not married yet
oh that's like next month
oh
I don't think so ah
like
ya because their cases also very crazy ah that's why
I mean I also miss going to and things like that lah but then
a bit scary lah
err
mm
I almost said city square mall but I know that's not
the mall that I'm talking about ah ya ya that's not that right ya
city square mall isn't that in singapore
ya but you get what I mean lah ya ya
um usually woodlands ah I take the the stupid bus to go over
then ya ya ya
oh
oh ya okay okay
uh
wah you busy sia
but good lah ya
correct correct
mm
mm
ah
oh
a'ah
mm
wah you not bad ah
still going strong ugh
ya
mm
is it I love wearing the mask eh
it's unpopular opinion I know ya because I don't like to smile
so when I don't when I wear the mask people don't expect me to smile I mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya lah that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya I mean actually I'm not unhappy or you know I just have the uh the what they call the resting bitch face ah
do ah then after that then I will just like
my my resting face will go back during break time or something ah
you know
so ya but then
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
hope they don't recognise me and think I'm just another malay girl
so I just like walk past them
ya ya
tegur
sometimes I don't even notice them you know when I'm just like blur lah you know like
ya
ya
mm
ya
so
ah
hello
oh F&B but now no more ah
then I want to find another industry to work at
then also
ah ya still searching lah that's why I I end up
about knowing this lah
ya
a'ah ya lah that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
ah
ya lah ya lah
ah
that's why
I don't know ah what's going on also
mm depends ah
they said
mm
ya lor recently I got a job offer
um the pay is okay lah the the work scope and time also okay
ya
ah what
then I mean
technically I think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
I don't know about you lah but ya
mm mm then
mm
mm ya usually they they like um and they like they prefer
registered people ah usually
but like
ya I
what
ya lah ya lah that's why I usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax ah
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope ah
ah
that's why
ya
because I was there for training
um
not so terrible like I don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
like they just like mood totally go down seh I don't know ah then
because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training tau
then she say to me like um what ah
you come here you don't know anything uh then how you going to teach the kids
then I'm like isn't this what's the point of training like I
ya
ya ya
ya
she said twice eh in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting what
so uh she complain to the boss in chinese
so ya the I was I know already she talking about me and she say about how like
fine whatever just
keep quiet ah then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
but then I'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously I passed lah because I do have the
credentials like
I know what I'm doing lah basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I uh obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do lah because
do okay you can quite teach lah but then
ya so that one gone ah
ya
ya lah ya lah
err
a'ah
a'ah
but in in terms of what do you mean
like
mm
ah
oh you mean ah are you like developers or
not really
oh
oh ya ya ya
wah that's interesting ah I was contemplating learning that
ya because um
upper course ya
that's cool ah
because I got media arts
um diploma advanced diploma ya
so I understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
mm
a'ah
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating ah so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
ya
mm suffocating
like means what
oh
I don't know eh
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone oh I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like eh actually I don't feel like going out ah then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
shiok ah like we living our best life ah but then I suffocated in a sense that
um
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
sometimes the things they do is just
ah ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy lah because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
oh um still the same also lah two but um I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird leh because um
like I'm the eldest kan
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
ya
so
barrier crossed and then
um she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree lah
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off lah ya
mm
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood ah
ya but she got the cert lah ya
no lah she working in those like F&B jobs lah
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know eh
better in the long run if you marry now or better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
law legally binding law law what you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
ah then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
mm
is it
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
um relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can um
get uh engaged and married what
oh okay that one also I don't know but normally lah normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya mm
I mean that's
uh that's from my experience lah I don't know whether
not like I got married before lah but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya oh this is how it's supposed to be ah I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
err uh um almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because uh first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous what
sorry what
whatever lah you know ya ya so
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun lah because I don't have to work and then
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity lah I feel
why
ah
ah
mm
oh my god
ah
but uh I think it's okay ah cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
oh okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy lah then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know oh I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay lah like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
um I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy lah you
so then how huh
oh
mm
oh ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family kan but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
girl ah ya ya ya my mum ya lor that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
mm
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that lah
but so far I've been going over they quite okay leh it's more like okay it's actually um my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how lah but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said lah we both like have our own place already
and then like okay lah maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period lah
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should already
ya because my friend like
they like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house lah
and the in-laws house
ya
mm
ya ya
because like
I feel
oh okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say um last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
so but then she say lah like in now these days a bit difficult lah but then
her ideal goal is still to move out lah ya
but then ugh
like
why you don't like the the the partner ah
mm
ya the okay
eh
ask her to get out ah really ya ya ya okay dah
ugh
ya ya ya
oh my gosh that's interesting eh
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
mm okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in jurong no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
ya
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought jurong was cool like the west side you know like oh cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of yishun
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay jurong a bit dodgy
a'ah
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of jurong
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
wah that sound so far away I don't know why
ya
mmhmm
yes it's true
ah
mm
oh ya ya that's right
mm
hmm do you like that or not
okay
mm
oh
those are touch and run away kind ya
ah
ah
ah
mm
a'ah
the what you do
what the
ah ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
watch group wah your parents also very ons eh
ah
oh
mm
mm interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
ya but I don't think I can be like you lah
like the last three times uh people someone follow me home I just confront them I don't care
you are not wrong I'm also very small but I think I'm just
uh
more like like I think too well of myself
ya
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me ah want like ya
ya it's damn irritating I cannot stand it ah like what you say ah
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
empty kan
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then
ah ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door ah
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya oops I cursed
ya lah ya lah so I'm just like oh I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
most of the not most of the jobs that I want lah but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no ah ang mo kio also got industrial park lah but that one is different industry
but ya
I mean not easier lah it will be
mm ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
um ya
would you rather town or tanjong pagar
it's a bit far for me
uh huh
ya
I cannot lah I I just for me I feel I get
mm
ya
ya lah ya lah
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
ugh
so it's damn irritating
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
ah I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons lah pros and cons
mm
ya
I don't know ah I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan kan like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID lah so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that lah like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
mmhmm
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
mm
obviously ya
interesting
ya lah ya lah such is life
my plan
a'ah
but I think he don't want lah
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long eh like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said lah he still need a teaching degree
then I'm just like wah that's very long eh that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that lah
a'ah
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that lah
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
study jer but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job ah so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know

eh true true
stop me from
pursuing it cause I think they also like know

you think you cannot fly
yes in order to succeed we have to fail first because we won't know
our mistake
in
mm
so my father say if he have to pay right then he gonna be bankrupt like he's just gonna be bankrupt
I think must pay a sum of ten K if I'm not wrong or like more than ten K

better to
ya
uh huh
ya
ya
ya true true true
mmhmm
true
ya
ya
true true true true
like I feel
like then I can execute it
I cannot be the one doing the critical thinking like
I don't think so my brain can
handle that much ya
even in I have already
I I I already sot imagine in freaking hospital
hmm
no no
ya
they have to be there for you lah to support you
if your friends like very like
what the heck like just mm wah shit lah then then don't don't don't bother
mm
correct two
it's like
we don't
we don't
push each other than the one person who was pushing the other person just left behind or whatever shit I don't know if you understand what I'm trying to say but ya
K it's like for example
I cannot be there at the same level I cannot be at the same pace as you
I have I'll be lagging behind cause I'm pushing you
I cannot be
I cannot be standing beside you and push you
you reach the finishing you reach the finish line first I'll be at behind then who will be helping me you cannot pull my hand cause you at the finishing line already
ah
that's my analogy
ah
oh alamak
alamak sis
oh he cheat on you
ya true
uh uh sis
sis I think I can um diagnose your
um
err what depression level are you right at right now I think you are at stage three
um
stage three
you are still at the denial stage you don't want to accept it yet
unlike me I'm at stage five
eh
at stage three
um you
you K one the signs of you um being at stage three is because you still can't accept
the fact that he's far way behind eh far way in front of you already
ya
and then
ah then
wah you funny you again sis alamak sis
correct
he stage three depression but now he already you think he stage five now or he's still at stage three
or maybe at stage four
still at stage three ah
but actually no
cuddle but in the morning I don't need it wei I just throw it on the floor
ah
we are
we are all human beings we
we have to treat guys
nicely
I don't know sis
uh
but actually I actually you don't need to pause I only need to pause
why so dark sis your
room
ah no electricity
oh
oh yes sis my house at night really oh sis we left thirty second
a'ah sis
then we can continue the second part

err my day today was okay it was quite a slow day uh
because I didn't do much uh today
um I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work lah
I haven't actually applied for anything
err I was there was this err job link that adli sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
err
err annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly lah but then there was an addendum to the title
that said uh it was uh
malay language specialist
basically just listen to
and then
transcribe them into
words ah
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
err natural language processing
feel
which is more concern with err and machine learning
where the
the itself
actually err learns language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then err
so
so ya lah the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
ah yes I will be part of that
a'ah
soon lah in a few days lah I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
so like
I got no results
the
err
so far no uh except for a few that I saw err
err wherever lah I think there's a few locations
no like err I I meet the requirements ya
mm
okay lah the exam was
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and err second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy uh
the best eh
probably second language learning
huh why
no uh because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory what so it's more difficult to screw up
ya ya I just want to pass
mm ya
your leave
mm
mmhmm
hmm
wait pause they made you take
a test
ah
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training eh
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya your boss's boss
ya
mmhmm
huh how come your computer shut down in the room
oh so the
so basically the zoom thing crash lah nothing wrong with your computer lah
okay okay good
whoa
okay uh
I sat in the chair
but it's okay lah I mean I managed to
err get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was err
that one maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want ah
I mean
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
ah
then he suddenly appears
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift eh
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
so
so basically there was no person in charge lah for the thing
wah co in charge lah
on the ups
mmhmm
mmhmm
after six
oh okay
oh
oh okay okay
ya
hmm
so he's new
ah
mm
oh
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
eh to whoever's listening
confidential okay
mmhmm
the what thing
oh okay
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
mm err on the days you're schooling
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
ya
okay shift is what time to what time
you
oh you cannot request for shift change eh
oh for your class eh
eh I think I destroyed your chair
oh okay
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
mm
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
mm
ya
mm
I think you felt the same way in that
take a break if that makes sense
mmhmm
oh shit serious ah
mm
ya
mmhmm
justin bieber
oh
oh they are not big fans of justin bieber
mm
have different workflows eh
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
oh ya lah
you better do it
ya
serious ah
mm
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit err
weird
like
there's no
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you uh
the previous shift
complacent ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I don't know uh I think
honestly to me
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send uh
in what sense
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
ya
mm
wait
okay
mm
mm
a'ah
ya like you
mm
mm
oh ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
a'ah
mmhmm
ah
ah
jaded
mm
oh okay
I was actually going to make a joke
ah okay lah
mm
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
huh
ya ya they know we we also know
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker eh
no no there's there's
ya there's
no now that one person has more uh
malay vocabulary to transcribe
ya ya
I don't know uh but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
kan it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine ah it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable lah
aiya
ah
a'ah sia
ah ya lah of course lah it's their job
just anime like
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching um
err Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
err
err there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
maybe add three or four months
ah ya
in japan
oh
but mm
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file ah
cloud
oh ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one ah
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
artefacts
but but then again
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands uh two thousand one to two thousand and four
the actual film
like
err like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
or like something someone would draw in paint
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the kan the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
err
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
huh
I mean you have an eye for the frame what
and then after that you will get like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things uh like
behind ya that kind of shot ah
mm
A U T E U R eh
a'ah
auteur
ya
but
err anything ah can also uh
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
flexible
in what sense
mm
okay ya
mm
oh to get ah ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and err location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
but with
a
psychological uh age not twist ah like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about ah
that looking into the
err
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay ah stimulating ah but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like um
like you know Annihilation
ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and err
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
err three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
through
err power
you know and like
a display of real fear
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
err
let's see
ah the wailing
the wailing
it's like
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
mm
ah
ah
ah
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
mm
I think I think they
go to the house
ya
mm
oh ya ya a'ah
mm
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail ah
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
oh ya that's okay okay we watched that one
we watched that one in the cinema uh
nevermind ah
I think that one will I probably will have to watch with rehan lights off speakers on
oh
mm
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it ah
eh I got A you know don't play play you know
director of photography ah
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
ah
no you know no
no lah we do it we do it properly lah but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from err getting
uh machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
oh ya
no need ah low budget ah indie
live what
no lah it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no lah
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free lah
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
oh ya correct correct
okay lah then when we on our off day then we do ah
I think can can no worry can be done
oh ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive
not anytime soon lah
like next year
uh my hot ah
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or what
ah whatever game you can try you try ah
mm you never try Borderland three
buy ah
for the for the release price lah the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday eh
what you buy
oh ya
oh ya later ah later
masks
yes
compress
okay lah
oh okay
huh
I want to I want to take one
nezuko
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation ah
ya lah so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the weeaboos it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
then I'm like bro you don't know what the weeaboos go through
I think
mm
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic ah in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
oh no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
mm
uh haikyu is not that
mm
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
oregairu
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
grounded in realism
ya like it was well thought out and well written ah
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season ah
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
mm
how it works is usually
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
ya
so that's basically how it works uh
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm
oh
mm
hmm
mm
J drama
mm
ah I watch one but I can't remember the name
real dramas eh
mmhmm
makeup
okay lah
decently young lah
oh
mm
mm
oh bullying eh
mm
ya
uh huh
uh huh
okay
mm
international
because there's a connection
mm
mm
mm ya
oh I mean jakarta is the city pe
oh okay
I think maybe most people who want to take korean are nice people
the not nice people take what language
take japanese
now
can you watch korean without subtitle
ah then after that I I I off I off the subtitle then after that you narrate to me
oh okay
mm
oh okay
a'ah
ah
ah
ah
oh yes yes because they adopted it from the
chinese archipelago
mm
oh yes yes yes
to speak it better than you're writing
ya
and I think speaking
mm
it's the case it's the case for almost everyone
the stages of err child language development
ya I learnt that
ah
koreaboo
but oh ya the key caps
wah
ya then it was like seventeen like that
oh okay
it dropped down some more
ya one O four key
huh
uh most of them use the same stems anyway lah

it was okay lah um they ask me a lot of question I think it's like very normal questions were only there they ask me like so what what caught me off guard was that err they ask me so what's your five year plan
you know like you know you don't think about it so much until you are being asked the question and then for a moment I just sat there jer siala what is my five year plan
err there's a position that opens up in a different department and um my manager thinks that I would be better in that then that is also something that I can also kind of move towards to ah
cause inspiration and aspiration is like what then I was like this needs time because I will not on that day I was a bit like sleepy for the interview so I just like okay mm answering the question never then they ask me something like what's your aspiration I think I said something but it wasn't that clear he ask me again and I said the same thing then he say okay nevermind
okay nevermind
I think it's how you phrase it if like my aspiration is to be able to be a role model when trainees ah sharing my knowledge and empower them that they too can be just as good or even better so it should be your it could be like oh
but it gives me a very nice err
oh long time like super long time well I'm not sure how long but definitely very long oh they are very stable like but I think I think it's a nicer I I feel that is a the whole interview kind of put you at ease you know so it doesn't make you feel tense outright so the way you answer also is not so formal
so it gives you the idea of okay you know I can err I can say a bunch of things but at the same time also it's like oh I'm not gonna penalize you for how you say it about like eh so what you want do you for five years ah ah you know like you like you could say like huh five years ah wah I never really think about it eh and and that's that's fine because you are being honest right but you know but but it's also err
you also answer like oh never really think about it eh but I also feel like five years I want to achieve personal milestones that I have set for myself in example like I want to take up a diploma in five years I wanna see myself radiating from it
I know five years for a diploma is long lah but you know you are working you could only part time you know you could fail a module also whatever but at least you can besides this coming to the questions I answer lah so I actually googled I usually before my interviews I would google some stuff yes just to prepare yourself and also it gives you an idea it's good to be prepared anyway
so give you an idea of like okay what you could use as an answer so and it was just because it's COVID right during the COVID pandemic period so I say ah oh ah I actually I never really think that far because in this COVID situation it's difficult to foresee um so far ahead because everything is still very cloudy
but I also feel I want to be able to achieve um more things
which is true I I think it's also like um I I feel like you you can be choosy but it has to be to a certain degree like I'm not saying that oh err in in example that I used to earn five K I only want to look for jobs for five K what if there are no jobs for five K oh you know what if there is some other jobs that
if you eh I give you three point five lah you want or not you don't want because why you because you wanna you wanna pay me five K exactly but also during pandemic what so people are if there's there's all these companies doing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
then how are you I mean yes I know it's during a pandemic but how are you going to like you know gain experience in this tough time how do you want to gain experience in a different um setting it's all about how you make it um you make it work in the in in this stuff kan lah fourteen december
it has been like what five years and if it's another five years it will be like ten years
I mean my my my business partner always ask me like so when are you going to come back to do the brand full time
of course I said for now it's a bit difficult like because I have other commitments to to juggle with maybe and then yesterday when I met her she ask me so how do I like the job yes I do like the job like
I mean like I have a new colleague so it's it's better now and I'm getting used to the job demand just that um
I don't want to be too greedy lah like to always do like different side projects is quite tiring yes so I just focus on my plan and this job
and I'm applying for house the so I don't know if I if I would get the sales of balance flats or if not cheaper ones if not have a resale like buy buy a resale wah that's that's okay too
yes but if you buy a resale then if it's like an older block the renovation costs I mean if the previous owners kept the house clean and decent and there's nothing much to pack ah but if it's sales of balance flats as in like no one has lived there before not that bad I feel cause it's a brand new house but it depends on location
yes I know your work right um about your own brand so she will your business partner ask you in a way whether you wanna do full time then it's there
err
you know it's funny when you you talk about that so like my current
it's the same people who say that kind of things to me at work and yet
billing up to like five six hundred dollars
yes you don't say lah hello you know your five hundred dollar is equal to like five thousand dollars to some people you don't hello exactly a part of me is like wah you say this kind of things ah
but you can spend five hundred dollar in my store and five hundred dollars sometimes it's just like two item three items
and and err we are on we are on the third floor right and then we can also see the crowd in the first and second floor so the first floor is two iconic brands like in every single household there would at least be one item I mean not every single household lah but you know on an average
mm
they are big paper bags that means they are handbags and you know the value of handbags is in not small amount okay we put minimum say three thousand wow
wow
I could spend three thousand in one day but I don't have three thousand to spend
okay
how much was it so did you not cancel the subscription
why wouldn't you want to cancel if you don't have sixty dollars to spend
in things that requires subscription there's always a minimum of seven days for you to unsubscrbe before it gets charged
dude that is why they have the terms and condition that you need to read yes and you woke up the next day did you hello
has it passed seven days I mean if you can read up lah I'm sure they give you the invoice right then it will come with the terms and conditions right but for subscription you can actually cancel lah but if you have paid for the one year and technically you have just use like what a few weeks so most to most they gonna charge you for one month
then there is that possibility of they refunding the last eleven months I don't know or what you can do so you remember when I was looking for their french company we were also doing subscription right so you know what they do they they look at their bank account eh there's a there's a transaction of this amount they call up their bank and they say it's fraud and then the bank will automatically um
do a a charge dispute to that company so that means our company so we have to refund them
yes yes yes yes so people say why am I getting charged for this I didn't err I didn't I didn't I didn't sign up for this so what they would do is they will call the bank hello there's a fraudulent transaction on my card then the the bank will say oh it was charged to this company do you remember signing up for any sort of no I only went to their website err can it can I request a charge back I want a refund
and then they will do it they will say okay madam you will receive your refund in the next fourteen to to how many days and the money goes back to your account eh you should do it really you you laugh it's actually how it is how do you think I do the charge back all the time I'm not telling you to be a cheapo but it it's not a necessity and in this trying times you should save money bro
see that's why you shouldn't play with your phone when you are half asleep sure like that would work later you will only sleeping closer to the charger
well I'm thinking of getting um this collagen I don't have swiss I thought I have doctor say I don't so I don't
err it's the security

the website is selling like sixty bottles for ninety eight bucks

and then um
yes I do but my new job requires me to wear safety shoes yes

so they told me one of my teammate told me to

the driver and two of my other teammates came out
and then when they came and approach me they said that
of guys around my table they also turn and look like why am I sitting alone in a table in a big round table for about ten people but I was the only one sitting there then my friends will like
so uh of course I was even more happy lah that you got like the birthday present I wanted but having said that

anything

I prefer those kind of like intimate stuff where I can spend times with my friends and family that I'm really really
that's why that's the thing
think about anything but then again
we barely see any sheeps you barely see any

okay so we have come to the end of this one hour conversation
thank you very much bye

okay I'm in
ya
ya
ya ya
how many people
wow
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
mmhmm
I think
they are
ya
ya
ya it's not basically is minuscule
I don't know
that's good man
that's good
ya I think so
so what next week starts ah
no
mm
ya ya ya ya
uh your skills your skill set and your experience kan
ya
the phase three ya
should be end jan
ah
you mean this this christmas coming now
okay
ya uh
okay
ya
ya
ya ya ya
mm
mm
would you be able to do that
ya
different things to do ah
ya
too tired
eh
feed her feed her
mm
mm
that's good ya they would have they would have a lot of drives volunteer drives because I'm I'm sure I'm sure some volunteers don't stay here I mean you know
kan
ya ya ya the also has lots of volunteer drives because ya one of it is the volunteers they don't stay for too long
so they always of course they always need to have volunteer drives
I mean anyway they have different volunteers
so you can some of them are dog walkers which is very popular because you get to chill with the dogs
err and then
critical care means for newborns newborns newborn kittens newborn kittens so they call me but you can always say okay I I volunteer
ya no lah fosterer no
what
ya uh yes
but I can if I volunteer okay for example if I volunteer for the kittens right so I pay for the food and all that medical I can go to their clinic
has a clinic ya they have a one of the very few I think if I'm not mistaken they might be the only animal shelter with a clinic ah they their clinic is relatively new some more
so I it's should because I'm fostering for them so let's just say oh the kitten is sick so I call the clinic and say eh your kitten I fostering for you you know it has flu then they say okay come by so I make an appointment and I go to the clinic and then they treat and then they I don't pay lor
because it's their fosterer it's their foster kitten I'm just taking care so I don't pay for the uh but I must go to their clinic okay so if I decide to go to my own clinic outside which I have done before then I cannot waive cannot claim or anything like that
is run by
donations they are run they run on donations
ya yes
people who recognise them and and and and donate sizable you know maybe companies or so I guess I don't know how well funded they are but they probably aren't so bad you know
government
ah G O V
but that is the problem
no that's rubbish lah cannot be
these dogs are still inhabitants of this country otherwise where are they going to go they have to be taken care of
in a humane way lah you know ah in fact I was just talking about it to uh to my grab driver over here
you know like all these developments that we are doing kan
development you know all the new new condos new property development sorry the is building up and they are raising and they are just flattening all the lands and the jungles
so and some other animal welfare groups are the ones having to pick up the pieces of these the dogs getting chased out the dogs have no place to go they cannot go back into the jungles they cannot go into a residence into into you know heartlands and all that so but who is pushing them out we know who is pushing them out who but who is picking up the pieces animal welfare groups who are running on completely on donations which is like come on you know what I mean kan it's like ya I feel that it's it's it's it's it's just rubbish lah what is happen there is no collaboration I feel there is no collaboration
first kills the dogs
no they don't both okay
I mean this this this look at
right now there are but the numbers declining is is really this that means eventually the dogs are going to go they're going to be completely out and what we want is you know can you guys collaborate a bit more no not bit more there's no collaboration can you guys collaborate with given if you're going to build and develop these places do something right but they're not
babe wild dogs wild boars and pythons where are they going why why why the pythons are coming out they are all in the drains what why are they coming out you tell me why are they coming out now why are there wild boars coming out now like in pasir ris why because pasir ris you know all the animal welfare groups the shelters were all there before right they were all there before no pasir ris farm way they were all there before the government took the land and they moved them to tengah now they are all in tengah now the animal welfare groups so they are developing pasir ris that's why the wild boars are there now you see them walking around wild boars why because there is a very clear example of this is what happens when you push them out they are going to end up out being visible uh to all residents who are going to panic
ah
pythons also
ACRES
and also and also the wild boars ACRES ACRES why do have why do you have picture of the snails on your
oh wow
ah
oh they are all the same
so what happens is what happen is you call ACRES ACRES will take ACRES ACRES A C R E S they are the animal the wildlife the wildlife group in singapore like monkeys ACRES the wildlife they are in charge so they can come up and take the snake I mean as in they trap the snake and what they would do they would microchip and they would release back into the jungle ya so that the snake is um is tagged ya they do that they're tagged then they will release back into the jungle so it still goes back into the jungle exactly where are they going to go right so they go back into the jungle then eventually they have to come out of the jungle again uh so so it solves nothing it solves nothing you know
ya they they microchip them they have to tag it so that they know that this is the one we have done before we've helped before something like that cute kan
quite a few
I don't like lizard
ya aww
is it oh so sweet
ya
aww bless her aww ya
that means you leave the food there and you walk away that one have but feeding I don't think so it's not illegal
right
ya
ya that one we tell people not to do
national environmental agency they are the ones in charge of dengue dengue mosquito breeding all of that and the environment lah
so water ya it's it's very tough water food you are supposed to feed the cat stay there I mean and then clear you're supposed to clear your feeding you have two hours to clear
you can get ya if someone catches you you can get fined
everybody if somebody reports you can end the ya you can you can get
for example if you feed right and then just in case happens to walk past then you kena fine lah or somebody reports you or what ya you can ya
no littering
you have to clear the food within two hours
you have to you have to okay you can feed
uh okay for example I feed I feed the cat the cat is here I'll feed the cat I put the food down all right I cannot go home
okay I cannot go home kan
you don't have to necessarily sit there and watch
but you have to you go you can go and feed more cats then you come back and within two hours you clear this is what we mean by within two hours
so at the end of the day within the two hours you come back and you clear lah some people of course they choose to just sit there okay and then go
that's what we mean by two hours
must clear the cat food yes
yes
all the cockroaches rats and all that ya so they don't want that so it's not illegal to feed but is you cannot litter
which is to me is fair enough lah you know like we let you feed then you know because then the cats are hungry then they will go to hawker centres and bother people
you know and then of course it's also a nice thing to be humane right the cats are going to be there they are going to be hungry anyways you might as well feed them
at the end it's littering lah I don't know on the spot is a forty fifty I don't know
whatever that is whatever the market rate is
ya but that one is littering lah
ya so feeding is not illegal littering is so what we call it we call it uh we we tell people to be responsible feeders
they they responsible feeding is what they want
and you can see signs posters you know at the lift no lah maybe not here lah but maybe other places you can see signs about responsible feeding
which is good lah to remind people you know kind of like that kan
ah
oh my goodness
they are copy cats
ya lah that's called district cats lah they're called community cats we call them
a pet cat
a pet cat some pet cats probably don't get
ya
ya it's their it's their joint
it's their joy
I know
mm
ya
ah
ah ya
eh
mm
because so much traffic eh
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm ya
but it's quite safe what this this tree
traffic
uh ya
ah
okay
ya
ah
ya
back to their refuge lah
people who work there know where these fellas go uh their time table their schedule like ya at ten o'clock they will be here but later they will go that way that way oh then by twelve o'clock they will be at that pond
uh so funny and it's true right they would go almost every uh almost everyday
I guess is connected to the I I don't I don't know where I mean I don't botanic gardens then connected to where ah the drains ah does it go to I don't know uh so anyways they were at the botanic gardens almost a lot I see them twice still the same ya but no when I was there there were also people but uh it's just you know the thing about botanic gardens is that although it is busy it's a refuge because
uh so I guess I guess in the botanic gardens the otters would feel safe despite
the number of people and visitors ya because it's a you know there are very strict laws right in the botanic gardens you cannot pluck the flowers you cannot pluck anything you cannot touch the animals so because of the set of rules uh I guess you know the the otter felt safe lah
oh
you know there are a few families ah apparently
otter
there is a fan club ah
okay when I say fan club means the people who are watching they love the otters they are the
they they monitor the otter activity
so they have the okay only the otter fan club lah
so and they they are actually very knowledgeable they know oh this is the kallang clan
so they have identified at least two families
two families which is
this is their territory oh then there's another clan which is
somewhere else not kallang so that is the one so they have different families lah all clans
maybe another clan huh
ah ah so they are very well fed they are you know they are very clever lots of fish
I don't think they look for other clans
um when they I I I don't think I think is like when I say kallang clan is like is like this is their territory
their roaming range is this is their range you know cats are like that
so for example if your cat is in this block he's he can range from this block to a few blocks ah this is their range so I'm sure they have the same
I guess among themselves lah I guess but they're very they're very they're very family oriented
so they can see the babies and all that and if fact a few died actually because one got caught
the angler hook aiyo so sad ah I think that was one was near uh
uh one of the um
so they have a few I'm not kidding about the clan I may have okay I call it clans I don't think it's called clan but you know what I mean
the the family ya
ya they do there there are a few at least two or three what I I remember in the news lah okay so what I remember in the news
um
I don't know if they live there
they don't they don't they roam
they roam they'll rove they rove um they
they might not they might not be the same clan because it's a bit far um the botanic gardens might be the same one as the maybe ya I don't know you know I don't know they don't just when they when they they don't just live in the botanic gardens it's one of their hangouts lah
one of their hangouts you know ah
ya ya ya
wah the otters right
cute right
ya uh
eh cute
ya but don't forget people are now becoming more aware of wildlife and all that no now
ya
you know ya
I think it's so refreshing I don't think so no uh unless they are caught by ACRES but so far no they are not caught by ACRES they don't need to be caught by acres because I told you the fan the fan club they are very active and they know they go like uh in fact when you sometimes the news right they can they can say oh this the the the kallang clan they have had two new babies they actually can know and recognise like there are seven adults and two new babies the mother is pregnant we go like wow bloody hell how do they know I guess they know lah they're like super fans which is really nice
nice to know right that you know there's this group of people who are just so so in tuned and they are like the the they are the they they walk they care for them it's really nice
you know not the caretaking type lah but ya they they the the otter watch group the otter watch group ya
no no no
I think the ulars maybe are not as I don't know maybe not as vulnerable and
and well okay lah let's put it this way lah shallow as it as it may sound but not as cutesy you know
as otters otters is becoming like a tourist tourist the attraction tau
but snakes and you know otters and snakes you know the the the whole perception of snakes being dangerous and all that
so no lah they don't snakes no but snakes if they are caught if you sight a snake at the drain you call ACRES and then ACRES will come and trap and tag them and release them back into the forest
they don't kill or anything like that that's why we call ACRES ACRES is good they are the wildlife
ah then forget it then forget it the cases that ACRES have have caught were the snakes are still there
so we have had we have had cases where ACRES came in and then the snake and then the bulge it's a com cat it's a community cat
nothing just tag and take them nothing just don't kill the snake it's a it's just tag it and then just release lah
go back to the forest I told you they release it back into the forest but this is where we when we back to our initial conversation where
back they go back into the forest but eventually they will come out again

I guess that's a need lah not a wish
but the thing is when I watch your when I watched that video that you uploaded kan it's like a it's a live stream but the thing is sometimes all I want to know is if I'm not playing that game I wouldn't know like what you are trying to do kan
because right how I can relate is like you know those there's this kind of channel or video and err where you watch people eat
because I think I watch the live stream not the edited one
just you just now you say about the spiders suit right I was thinking
I don't know just now err
for your suit jer
include ship
how long you need to wait for
I don't know whether you want to get for the kids cause they will grow very fast
he can wear the puffy one ah
how about the brother
what about the mum mother what we have a tripod for what
K lah faster lah you order for me and then you order for safi also lah
I want to wear the gwen okay that's the only character that I can wear right
spiderman series lah kan
then I just pass it off as spider cat ah
the one that you say oh black cat right spider cat is the we just created a new character
just created a new character no I think he followed me ya he followed the style of conversation no but you ate cheese fries already yesterday oh ya I'm supposed to cook the soup first
ya for dinner then at least tomorrow you can eat it for lunch lah
the thing is I don't know whether I ah actually I want to take half day I got
no I wait the following week is not christmas right
ah I will take next week actually
because I got one more half day I never take wait let me think
oh gosh I don't know because next tuesday I already on leave kan maybe I just take this friday lor next tuesday is for its for appointment what
wah I don't get it seh how did you even accumulate fourteen days eh oh ya because she she doesn't need to take leave like me right
wow what a plan
I wish I could say that
ya that's the thing because you your contract already said you need to clear you need to give it two months notice that's why you you have that mind mindset that you need to save them
oh
during his first year birthday eh wait but that is last year but then how come this year my leave exhausted I think it's because the the sick or when they are sick I keep taking leave at the start of the year
then can we buy like two so one is on the left one is on the right
so the alternative is either we change the sink or we build a
serious I thought he called somebody
father in law
were we even there I was not there
what a shitty experience
was the EX1>bangla< paid
aiyo I'm just thinking
okay lah no no I'm not even thinking of renovating the toilet
then the is the end product nice
no I mean like dan house
you can just ask what
like that
huh
no I mean especially if it's if no surprise to see talking about surprise that's the thing sometimes right it works err in your favour sometimes
not hot pink lah like the like the lighter one like a bit more pale
the app no lah that one champagne gold lah ya ya ya correct correct correct ah like that
ya that's the only cause the master bedroom you know I don't think I want to change anything maybe maybe just the part ah change to a bigger no the thing is right no no no let me just explain I want to use
projector you know that one no you know they have this technology where you bring like the kind of like tissue box style and then you can project the thing when you have it's not a torchlight it's a projector
like the the torchlight for the story book eh
gosh
h
no but that's the highest I could go I couldn't and then what I need kan
no the the photo they want it to be the resolution when you port it to photoshop kan is in three hundred but my the the camera that the G seven X camera at my office the highest you can go is hundred and fifty or hundred and eighty the point and shoot
camera our phone cannot set raw kan raw image file
what iphone can ah
four A is small kan
aiyo
I'm just thinking what should we have what shall we eat for dinner already cause I know but that's for the kids
oh
so in the end you pick up what time
oh
sensitive eh
it's okay ah
that's very good that's a five star rating for the delivery man
eh sia lah
why ah
oh right right right um I remember um they asked me to rate that time ya rate your delivery person
oh right right right ah I remember err they ask me to rate that time your rate your delivery person
oh
I don't know some people they they always say err you always have room for improvement so they always give four point five I'm like what the heck tell me ah where is the room then they always like oh you know we cannot give perfect score because you know we must leave some room for us maybe that's why I know I know
huh
beat it ah
beat it ah
I can't remember maybe maybe I think my reaction was the same as last time ah
it's harder to
is because of the figure of eight
crank course not crank course lah plank
the crank course is ninety degrees kan its like U-turn lah
no I thought that one only for the first lesson only
only the first lesson kan I don't know lah I'm just thinking whether I should take class two a
drink this water or not
from last week lah that I am that's okay what it's just water
huh what do you mean
doesn't correspond with the job ah
huh
ya how much how much did he did he quote
um
right
ya lah
okay but that that is not her problem what is the deal ya is the deal between the father and ya you guys what like he has no right to intercept what who told him
there is another company if you all want to consider ah it's quite easy video ya work not bad lah but maybe the okay but you also not going to stay there but if you want to do them a favour you can check it no but will will will you will you even like speak to them about the like if they need any video
eh is it because of the the payment the changes oh that sucks
serious compensation as in like discounted lah oh my god and is already like at the low you all only you all choose the lowest lowest vendor get the most out of the smallest budget
I see that lady that is going away she is stepping down again
wow so this event is to commemorate her stepping down lah what oh the the election
moment ah
right
fourteen upcoming members as in new members
new and existing I don't understand what do you mean total is fourteen so now you have how many oh
wah so actually I want to know what's the criteria for you to become a board member
I mean you must have you must be earning some form of money because she is a board member right
see that's why I want to know because if you are a working staff you don't qualify to be a board member already what
right
the broth
tayoh
it's very everything is important you know when they say like oh everything is urgent
maximum I can bring you is to the door but to open the door right you need this key and this key is a degree
then they will be like oh can lah shah you know I would right but I could could not I cannot ya sia really I always give this kind of then they will say shan stop trying to be clever I'm not trying to be clever if I'm clever I'm already your boss
then they just laugh
because if I start on it I cannot do anything else and everything else is urgent so by the time I get this for this scheduling I cannot finish it ya and the deadline is tomorrow wait is today the deadline today is thursday right today is the deadline
for now time is ticking and I'm thinking what to eat later so I don't know so that's that's one of the stress that I I don't know how to work around this picture the other thing is
I should lah actually
exactly and people are going to brunei you wah

real relationship

that's kind of long sia
that's like two years later eh
but technically speaking if he comes back to you after two years right I think you would have moved on sia
I think you would have moved on already
like now you're in the process
for you for him it's easy
because guys will have the mindset that they can get everything they get they want
serious serious they they can they will use that
ya
ya
ya
mm
the thing is you don't know that's why
exactly
oh my god
astarghfirullahalazim

that one ya that one mm ya that's the truth ah
izuan is like
he came into the picture later exactly
maybe ten percent ya
I'm not supposed to tell you
I mean you cannot tell lah but
okay you get the feeling
oh
ya exactly
I mean if you moved on already what can you say
okay if caring okay
err his kind of
lead you on
ya
get you into thinking things that are otherwise the things
to get you into thinking things that
are otherwise that he thinks
okay
he talks to humairah about you right
K that makes you think he hasn't moved on right
but instead if you ask him that face to face he will say oh I just care care for you as a friend
ya exactly that's that's that's what I meant by he keeps leading on
ah
so you get what I mean now
that's why
don't high hope sia
mm
never ya just dont care about him move on zack is in front of you even if zack doesn't like like you again
maybe in the future maybe will
ya exactly
ya lah
she got cheated
oh my god
like just like that
oh my god
ah ah
she straight up said that
break up
oh okay
so they are still together
serious ah
mm
I mean
for you
right
ya
ah circuit breaker
ya it's very rare to like find guys who are less
you know have that
ya
high hopes eh
mm
mm
oh ya
why
oh okay now I get it because
okay lah now getting because I think he say because split I do number isn't ah linguine with me to select and mulberry is opposite lor
but did you tell him that

now what time
but what can he do so
mm
it's okay
it's okay
he does trust me
you told like so vaguely you told him what
okay I'm not I'm not saying it's a bad thing but
I mean ya you're kind of fast lah but
rather than him might as well you go for someone else right
ya exactly
you're right

straightaway the answer legit would you like to
would you like to have that
that that has been my conclusion all my years
you know that mirah tell me you know like okay
oh okay okay sorry then we were going home right
ah
then after that she asked me like have you had a boyfriend before
that was like somewhat close to
uh dating ah
then he told me

okay no I'm I'm not stereotyping lah but
I mean isn't that
she told me that you know umirah
she said she knows that some
the guy bought
kan
can you imagine if I tell izuan that
I say that
even if like there's there's plenty of guys asking me for it
I wanna see his reaction then he will be like very annoyed confirm
kan
ya sia
oh huzni texted you while we were talking that one
I'm not the only one wearing like that what there's other girls also who wear like that
I'm just saying ya

is it
okay so
I don't know I've just been always I've always been so angry at the world
you know there's this
that's why
I take a like you know those people keep taking the aesthetic boomerangs so I try to I try to be aesthetic as possible but I'm just
cannot make it lah cause it's just me
then I like
he said it in malay and then
his the way he converse in in malay is okay lah but it's quite limited
but I don't know why he suddenly replied in malay but uh um

for real
hmm
hmm
uh ya
ah
gosh I hate myself
wah
because there's two short cuts
that's why bro what the hell
oh my god
how how dumb ass can you be sia
what bull bull ass is that I don't think that's a good reason though
I
ya
ya
oh ya
you wear this strong enough to you ah can react how which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself what
ah that means because of the tsunami and earthquake that is inside madinah and makkah
so the
so
ya ya ya ya ya so exact obviously it's a school trip so obviously you have to learn about all the
not not even the worst bro because it's because I think that's
are you sure
I see I see I see
oh I know
kan but I mean
you know I was like thinking how can I be so lucky to be in this country in this religion in this like family
I'm like
what a what a blessing sia so much blessing in one time tau
ya
it wasn't a couple years back
but a few years
ah I see I see
pandemic
but
but it's not as bad as this oh that one was it before SARS or no
I think it's before SARS
mm
ah it wasn't
oh
I know it was a big thing in singapore ah but it's just for what because we were
eh is there I'm not sure though is there I mean I don't think so if I'm not wrong they say there isn't any
it looks a like flu ah like you know COVID is like a flu also
ya if I'm not wrong if I not mistaken
ya ya so
kan kan
kan
kan
but then again if you think about it the possibilities of you getting the virus in singapore what's the possibility though
kan
ya
community hospital basically
yes not for surgery kind of thing
ya it's also
ya ya
yes yes yes
ya that's why
ya
that's why
ya
ya but in the first place there is so many
ya
expats expats
I didn't know expats were okay sorry expats ya
ya
true true true
oh
oh jurong island
ya then that's why that time ah I don't know don't know whether it's a
should be lah right
ya
it's not good ah
should be lah I don't know
oil right why is oil good
that's the thing
ya

if that day right I already start uh applying for jobs on this uh
fast job app online then a few of the jobs ah like very interesting
have you ever tried that before
but uh because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
they will see your they will see your feedback and then after that they will uh record and then they will see then they will pay
mm
mm but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
mm
ah
so basically you just have to rate the uh display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
oh my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy paiseh right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come lah it's just that they don't know who only right
oh my god
but imagine ah if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then ah another job I tried right is the
then they call me actually they said the um it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
be to commit long term because I was telling them
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that uh she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company lah but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya lah anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good lah it's three times a week only
mm permanent part time but they need it uh long term
uh shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
is so it's quite convenient what it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
mm
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already mah
uh the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff lah
mm mm
so just anyway just send lah just see how
but some of them ah don't even bother to reply
one six months ah six months to one year you know
and then uh they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose uh the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar eh
the one
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that err also I think it's mondays to
eh it's alternate days eh
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week ah
actually they will give us uh every end of the month for the following month
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
ah rather than your part time job
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit lah and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
the qualification lah I think
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
then my company say cannot because uh according to the rule you cannot do that lah if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
so basically ah you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard uh my ex company
some of the pinoys ah they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
rent
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
so these uh factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra uh I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms eh and then I think there's uh three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people lah
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
day time he's at home he's working remotely lah
and
so he said uh sometimes they dabao then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part lah
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean lah then I'm like eh but you are using the toilet also eh
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent eh
good money right actually
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also lah
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit ah that time he mentioned
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent lah you cannot um anyhow spend
that's why
ya
maybe have lah because um they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and um I think flights also not regular so you have to
they have to go means they have to go lah I guess but then
ya lah like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for or you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the uh advertisement right or the job uh post on link in linkedin
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency lah
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best lor
but then six thousand eh
I didn't know that uh all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K ah I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks ah sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure ah when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo ah is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental ah can
give her like four five K per month eh
because I have friends who married ang moh right so expat ah
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month ah you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already ah
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses lah I mean like um
as male bosses are okay
ya they can demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
err the husband is paying what why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
so what the they did is they always ah book first book a travel first
then got one time ah suddenly the the secretary call me and say eh how come my boss ah the krisflyer point is um
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this uh relocation company
the wife redeem uh free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part ah they didn't even uh say anything to me you know
then after that uh until I ask again ah
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also paiseh ah I said oh ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the uh points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim lor
and never even bother to tell him
ya
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only uh get like fifty percent of the mileage
very flexible one ah that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
I always get like you see lah you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket ah you must tell them this one ah if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
then in the end what happen
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay lah not that much ah
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot lah because this is obviously your mistake
for us ah the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault lah because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright what how can we just you know
but it's actually very scary ah especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
and then the new flight that you take for him
ya
but he's from which airport
it's either ho chin minh or hanoi
so in the end I think you must have booked him on lah because only these two fly direct what
ya
ya lah very scary especially the hotel bit
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
you do this batch I do this batch ah it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date lah so at least eh
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means ah the person that you cock up is your team or
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel lah
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate ah
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already what
you can always book um through
all these third party from the website lah no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes ah hotel themselves even though they give uh they sell their rooms to all these third party
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in what
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course lah right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people ah
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least ah you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one ah family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because uh booking from third party ah I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday uh sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
then how
but hong kong passport don't need visa what
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival lah always uh tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
mm
otherwise you will waste one day
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes ah you just
can you imagine ah if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then ah I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company uh based right
oh
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity ah anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it duh
ya just put out your resume first ah
mm

alright err what were we talking about singapore social right ya
okay err

provided you didn't do all sorts for your nonsense all sorts of your nonsense lah which
I'm not going to disclose I'm not going to disclose lah that's why I
then err
I think
err I'm fine with everybody it's just that I cannot get along right with I cannot get along with

I really really don't that
I really really don't like
so
ya lor actually in all honesty ah I kind I kind of hate everybody ah

more than I hate myself
is a very interesting character is one in a million diamond in the rough
should tell her that ah
tell her that
you have any other hot friends
yes I'm very I'm I'm very very I'm for life
or am I
I don't know I'm I'm I'm regretting all my time in right now
no
actually that's really messed up that's really messed up you know the fact right that all
all most of the
toilet recording all the most of the toilet recording incidents right
all happened ah
like you know
is most of them right that make the news ah is all
it's all guy on guy crime that's one
then it's all on the N it's all in you know then err
and this is not the and I mean there's been one or two cases right very very recently that they just brought up
that was just that was just brought up
then err but this wasn't new you know because like say about a year
about a year ago right about a year a year two years ago ah
because I sleep in school
so uh and
my friends they also know they also know this ah
most of the it's
and some more it's in you know how embarrassing
no lah but
no lah but it it it you know it just it just happens right that I'm also schooling in you know shit
no
but then again but but then again but then again
err most of the
err most of the incidents takes err take place in ah
whereas the places where I
patron right err
the toilets where I go to ah they are more like
public access whereas the
hostel ones right they uh most of them
err some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge ah
I'm not too sure about this lah I can't confirm but
there are some right where
err
I think this one also depends on the price of your accommodation ah
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
I really really really needed to take a
so
err
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
so the guy actually err took I still remember you err he had the
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I I entered ah so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
err
you know that like single floor toilet ah
it's just a
it commune toilet ah communal toilet ah that's all only which I can
I can see why right I can see I can probably tell you why lah people
err those pervs right they are more inclined to
to to do this kind of nonsense ah
um there
for you to do that there's only two ways one is you have a
second if you don't have a you need to uh err
you need to involve yourself in hall activities
but
that's lame ah err that's lame lah uh I
a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby
he told me right that that's that used to be the case but it's no longer but currently it's no longer the case already like
uh for them right they're just willing to rent out the accommodation to you ah
that's it only there's no need for you to like
you know and then sweat your punk ass
and then err like or hall activities ah like
yay sixers or whatever
so lame
it's quite it's quite cringey ah it's quite cringey like
there was one there was one time err
err they had like
a orientation week orientation week
it's always the week before the semester starts ah
so they had I swear to you ah it was really cringey
err they had those like err orientation games ah then
they printed out shirts and everything so it was a game of thrones theme
so they uh like what I saw like a bunch of guys in a bunch of guys and girls right they were all
wearing the same thing blue T-shirt then it was like starks and then like
running away from a group of red people in red right who were like gangsters so to me right that's a bit cringey lah
who the hell is running man
who is running man
I have no idea who the hell that is
maybe it's just me lah ah probably it probably is lah just me but
until now I still don't get
err
I don't get the concept of hype beast
I don't understand the concept of hype beast
err last time it used to be
the trend is tight T-shirts is like slim fit tight T-shirts now the trend is
loose or slightly oversized T-shirts so
err
it's weird lah if you ask me
meh
what trumpist
rare commodity okay
oh okay wait hold up hold up you're referring to you're referring to
oh okay lah that's pretty american lah you don't I don't see that the the closest thing I've seen in singapore is um
err I think there was one time I think err can't remember what's her name ah she wore a baseball T-shirt
she wore that was like baseball baseball outfit
to work
no lah but filipino is like that what they that's their that's their sport ah
that that's their sport it's the same as it's the same logic as
I think philippines
philippines they have a they are known to really like
they are known to like basketball
and they are also known for engineering and nursing also that's why
you see ah like when err back in my old workplace ah the one before
the one before
the guy err he also told me also and
the place there right there were quite a handful lah there were quite a lot of err filipino guys ah
so ya
oh okay
damn
filipino ah to begin with
how sure are you
really
okay
okay fine whatever
wei xiang is which one
oh wait it
okay right then
mm
really
wait
what's he is he working there full time what what's his position there what's he doing exactly in
until now
and that's such a waste ah
like I mean err I get I mean if
if your highest hopes in life right is to be a cashier
for a departmental store right then more power to you lah but
it kind of sounds like a shame ah what did he study when he was in when he was pursuing his diploma
ah
can can you I don't know got stocks to trade for FairPrice that kind of thing ah
oh really
really
okay I really I probably wouldn't know any of this shit
a million dollars
what kind of lifestyle like player player
okay
that's gay
this is this
wait is he still with the same guy
until now
not that I care lah but
err
err my question is right
what is that guy doing
tool
hold up jack's is the okay ya then
wait which again the one at ang mo kio
oh really wait there there's a jack's in ang mo kio meh
no okay that one I know already it's that one wait is that is that one still around
wait so it's it's an affiliate of jack's ah it's like one of the sister companies ah
or like
okay lah fine
you know it doesn't take a diploma her his higher his esteemed diploma right from
were from whatever polytechnic right you know you you can you know work as a cashier at you know with
err less with less than qualifications right
he is aware of that right
oh how the tables have turned
hold up the boyfriend is rich still mooches off
your friend ah
so was that the turning point
for him turning homosexual
okay
mm you can't you can't put a you can't put a price on love right though
wei xiang two hundred range
hais oh my gosh
your friends right your friends are like
extra retarded ah for real
so joe rogan
that ethics of becoming an Instagram model
is there anything ethical is is there an ethical aspect right to being an Instagram model
because Instagram after all right is just a page where you put photos
I mean ultimately ultimately right when it when it boils down to the you know like
common denominator type thing ah
it's just a web page it's just a page where you see photos
so is there and ethical ground right behind being an a model on Instagram
like what what constitutes ethics ah in
Instagram modelling like what you you have to
I mean like what like what you
be you you be super hot you take a photo right of you being hot right around starving africans
is that ethical
wait which one was it
no
probably because you didn't feed it to me
lies lies okay anyways
so is the sister the sister is
wait what okay fine ya okay ya ya
oh okay okay wait hold up hold up so
technically right technically he
he didn't he didn't flash
in a sense right in a sense right
he advertised himself right as he
he try to proposition for
ah for sex right for minors
from minors right with
by
know using using his fame ah not with paper ah
oh really
come with me in my videos
who is him dee kosh
would you want to know dee kosh
why not
so wait this is what gay privilege
oh wait hold up that amber
huh which finger
okay then
Tesla guy
the elon musk okay fine then
but to begin with right does he does he even know right that
those people are minors or not the his victims right
did he know that they were minors
okay
if that was the case right my question is
who are the people right who empower dee kosh
where does dee kosh derive right his fame from YouTube right who empowers him
is the youth of today
why
because right we're easily swayed we're easily we're easily swayed right by stupid shit
by simple stupid shit
to begin with also right
that's it
am I right to say am I right to say I can't remember what's the author's name ah err am I right to say right that
err the person who wrote catcher in the rye right
err the person in the catcher who wrote catcher in the rye right is a influencer
because he influenced the guy to go and assassinate the the kennedy
you know kennedy ya
ah ah okay oh my goodness ya john lennon ya
to influence them to do what
okay
but Instagram by itself right but but Instagram by Instagram by itself right
is just a platform only ah is the people is to me right
to me if you ask me personally right I would say that it's the kids of today ah it's
the young impressionable kids of today right who are so drawn into
nonsense antics right who
who follow this guy ah who give this guy a following who
in return right he generates he generates revenue right from
err you know from uh from his
the the legions the legions from his legions of ah from his
no the legions of followers that he has uh uh okay I'm being sarcastic lah about the legions lah cause I don't think he has
he got he got himself into he got himself into
into this kind of into this kind of nonsense then to amplify this to amplify the
situation right on a personal on I guess on at
face value level type
thing ah he
you know he makes a living he he makes a living talking about people mah and also like talking to
see what happened lah the tables have turned the tables have turned already ah the tables have turned lah err it
come it kind of like goes to show right that
you're not as smart as you think you are lah you probably didn't plan
you probably didn't plan your you didn't have a contingency for backlash ah
you didn't you didn't see you you couldn't possibly see right you're just so considered you're so considered right in your
five them ah that you didn't
everybody you know everybody ah has
everyone has skeletons
everybody has skeletons including yourself you know everybody has skeletons but now you make
you make the profession ah you make a living you know by by make a living ah you
earn money eh to feed yourself you know not now I we don't talk about other people ah you feed yourself right with
with
err talking very poorly talking down on people err pointing out people's mistakes and all uh and all that you know
everybody does this you know you know gossipping right
girls gossip also what we are doing now right is actually gossipping ah we're gossipping about other person
but your but I think it's important right that
we have to gossip truthfully you know we have to gossip truthfully
now ah even if we don't gossip truthfully even if we don't gossip truthfully eh
he he puts it online ah he he
in in a sense right he broadcast it he broadcast his opinions his opinions on people and then
look what has happened ah like
most of the singaporean singaporean celebs lah I kind of like hate all of them
the one with the skinny malay guy
ah nicole seah
not nicole seah what's her name
the nicole choo is really not doing anything wrong you know dee kosh eh is dee kosh and
I guess ah uh dee kosh right is really being being a straight up
err straight up douche oh err in a is being a straight up douche ah because
those irritating irritating nonsense eh on err they do irritating nonsense right then they upload it on YouTube
knowingly right post it on social media then everybody were to know
you can go ahead and comment lah but then again when it comes to when it
it's err it's too it's too malicious ah like
it's it's really too it's really too malicious already ah like
err like for me for me right the videos eh
her work probably isn't really that
isn't isn't that great ah because like from the looks of it right she's not really that deep ah to in in all honesty she's not
she she's not that deep ah like the you know
my heart right my heart ah the the abyss that is my heart right is probably is probably deeper ah
that she did right is
she
she kind of like jams
jams YouTube with her shit ah
like I I don't want I don't want to watch this this is this is
this doesn't do anything for me
this doesn't do anything for me
no
like TikTok and all this you know like I don't get the concept of TikTok you know I get the concept of Vines you know I get the concept of Vines
I just don't understand the concept of TikToks
it is
so I'm an I I'm an anomaly ah
yes
err like nobody's supposed to no one is supposed to care about this kind about this thing you know no one is supposed to care about this thing like
what you have in your bag the car that I drive a day in the life like why do you want to care like okay ah okay ah a day in the life right I get it a day in the life I get it but what's inside my bag like

like for for myself right I don't see I don't see any form of
err I don't see them as as men right I don't see them as masculine
I'm I'm not buff you know I'm I'm incredibly fat but in all honesty I think that I'm more mescaline than they are
on the exterior right I think that I'm
what skills that what skills right do they possess right that

they don't have survival skills okay ya lah they make they make money they make money out of
they make money err on YouTube entertaining people lah but besides that
okay what influence

ah
a'ah
lah
ya
oh my god
syarif syarif malaque eh oh okay
I see
ya correct ya I mean nobody really turns on the
no
ya so it's like err I I mean I don't know is it cause it's very peachy
ya that one was quite interesting
ya
ya like just inner noise
right
cause I think now we have netflix right I don't like the idea of having to oh okay I have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know
ya like what okay let's go says ah which is very true everything is on demand
ah
oh my goodness
I mean ya it's true I mean if you think about it like what one in three malay people in singapore listens to right
or something like that
I'll try to put my phone
K K I put my phone here okay ya
oh ya what finance
oh yes yes yes cool
oh a partner
oh err wait
oh true true true
ya then I will find a partner
let me try my husband
oh
ah ah ah
ya
haiya if like that then
like that jannah and I meet up lah to do it
then like that there's no issue about it right
ya can also then it'll be like a meetup hangout
ya
sounds good
ah
okay
ya
pessimistic as in about your relationship
uh huh uh huh
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
oh okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred K in like in in like asset
ya
in general but I don't know I still think hundred K feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house what
ya correct
but then how how would you okay I I mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old I think most people are earning between what four to five K around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like I I mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
ya
mmhmm
ah
ah
I don't know but ros also
oh like you yourself okay
mm mm
mm
okay okay I think
I think it's cause of the industry as a whole lah also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all I mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's you know what can happen
huh
a'ah
ya
what oh no but eh five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred K ya lah there's your savings
dope okay lah hundred plus
okay eh then okay eh not so bad eh hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan ah is
but is but six hundred plus K right the the cost price of your condo
mm
mm mm
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus lah
mm
ah ah
ah
ah
to to to pay off your loan okay so I watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from kan
ah okay okay can lah
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right

huh then what
mm
mm
you told him that
that you don't want to get married without a job
okay
ah
ah
ah
like da da da and
actually I think can what
as in like as in a green light
you you won't get retrenched firstly cause of your seniority and then secondly
I don't know I mean if he this this would be the perfect time to see if he if someone can support you lah through difficult times kan
but I think it's just you lah you just want to you know make make sure that everything is perfect before you enter any serious commitment
ya now I have to try and change my earpiece
cause it's running out of battery
ya it's very annoying
so I hope it work
inshaallah lah eh now where is my
earpiece
I think I should borrow hidayat earpiece
eh there
cause this stupid google pixel a'ah google pixel
so every week at least one night he will stay there
ya
so I have I have some time to myself
my mother-in-law my mother-in-law wanted hanan to like stay over so we just do it lah
okay
okay
how about wait ah we pause for a while
okay let me try again so now I'm attaching my earpiece in
okay ah this is another wireless earpiece
please lah work please please
okay
okay good good good
ya so I will get
ya correct
I'm very lucky already still want to complain about my son I think about sending him all the time
crazy ah
he is I don't know I think he is
ya he he has his moments lah but he's becoming so naughty ya ya he like just the other day he falls off the bed tau
ya did he he he rolled off the bed
ya
so now we are trying to put him on the mattress
then you know I started baby proofing my house
ya so got the baby lock lah you know by the drawers you have to ah pull out and things like that ya but hanan figured it out like he plays with the hook
then he he he saw me doing it and then he copied
that is wishful thinking
okay lah
eh can you hear me clearly
okay good good good ya this earpiece is a lot better than that stupid airpod keep running out of battery lah
I didn't know this one got okay this is just ya correct
I can even
this is xiaomi
it's only twenty dollars
unlike the airpod which was like what three hundred
ya I think he's buying I want to buy this type too
I already got the job lah
like I mean you know they they like like on the website like I've already been rejected from all the other applications
but one is still open like still pending pending approval so just wait lor it is what it is it takes a very long time
ya and I really want that job though
ya but ya lah I'm also scared but at the same time
for the position is
it's compliance manager
ya
so I hope they pay well
yes yes jannah was the one who suggested yes
ya I was quite surprised also
she should go
ya
she should go cause her sisters also going
oh my gosh
but her sister got degree
oh oh oh
okay
mmhmm
mm ya
mm mm
ya correct
ya
the house is a better investment ya correct
eh actually you don't need lah you don't need the degree yet you know why people use the degree to buy a house not the other way round
like you know people go get a degree so that they can afford to buy a condo not you already have your condo then you use your condo to partially finance your degree I mean like what's the point you know you've already achieve that
ya lah
ya which is ya which is which which I get it ya
ya ya I mean I totally get that lah but you can also do that after you have kids or do it with your kids in future
I don't know
but ya lah a degree is ya I don't know I don't know if it's pointless or what but ya I wish I wish I went through the
I think right it's more about the experience like you have in school like if you were a part of a campus at then I feel it's really worth it
that to me ah
and then they teach you
ya lah around there lor
that is what for one year only right twenty three twenty three K
eighteen months
actually okay what right
eh but come
ah ya true ya true true
ya that's true plus you are also getting married
ya ya ya ya
but don't do anything you don't want to do
you know
but now you realised that hey actually my life is pretty good right unmarried not not married
and then you are not sure by getting married it will make your life better or worse like would you even feel empty if you're not married
you know what I mean
ya
mm mm
there is there is
no of course there's going to be a very good reason to get married
you
ya
ya ya ya it's a perfect size and width
mm mm
okay okay
ya mmhmm
ya
like I would go and save and look for couple massage and then buy right
but he splurged like five hundred plus okay then
ah
okay
wah
okay okay
a'ah
a'ah ya like the what the wave okay
ah
ah ah ah ah
ah nice and where did you guys go for dinner
nice
as in ros booked the restaurant okay
mm okay okay
mm
so he cancelled the other one
nice pretty nice
aww so nice then what what you packed
like you packed like the clothes for the day
huh
cute seh
you know I trust him now
that's good that's good
ya
which is I mean to be fair also it's hard for him lah how is he going to talk somebody like robert right who's been in your life for so long
ya slowly in future to your family
ya lah I know
what what what about him does she wish would be better
that's good lah
there's a I do there isn't but ya she just decided that okay lah just let them live their life
you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna interfere
then after that he's like why you so rude ah I don't want to go lah then he called his sister and said oh I'm I'm not going already then I have to go lah I went out with his family
and my sister-in-law and hanan
ya I was so angry but you know cause
and they they so excited seh they want to go out with hanan
hais
I want I'm trying to trying to so it's like
it's like on and off then you see on my instagram I'm not wearing ya
it's something that I want to try and do but we will see lah inshaallah lah and I keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
I ordered online on shopee and then after that I compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
I bought like of shopee lah like um you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that I also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me lah they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
ya
ah
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
his family I mean his sister asked me lah I told his sister lah the truth
ya I think he just bad day they also know what that he
a bit
ya
like he got his temper
ah ya I told I told his sister ya
ya
hais
ya lah this is
eh you know that used to be me but now I'm like haiya I really cannot be bothered like I cannot be bothered by a lot of things
ya
he's okay if cause for hanan right I make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually hanan is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
I think ya
ya I I cause I know eventually I want to go to work what
ya ya correct so I need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also lah but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like hidayat will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
ya lah but I love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya I just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
then today right I'm going to make stocks for him
I'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
but like plain
no salt no what
now um next week ah
ya
ya hopefully
maybe
huh I really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
you know what I mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
hais
ya
the only one for a long time
oh my gosh
ya so he
he's going to do it at furama err this girl is from she's doing ah I think it's his schoolmate or something
ex schoolmate so she studies biomedical sciences
ah
cause of the cause of the way he responds
the girl the girl is works in a lab so she does
I don't know she tests things she run she's the ya she does research
nazreen is an engineer so he works in the east so he does he's like my sister lah they she they studied mechanical engineering
ya
he's been working a while
ya I saw the girl stays in the east
they they will stay stay with each other for a while la while they look for resale
ya so cause nazreen works in the east so they going to stay with the girl likely
ya but then the girl works at so you imagine
huh serious
serious
mm mm
plus the set up all that which which is okay I I don't know I thought ya but then I think my degree was cheaper so but they got they got back quite a bit lah so in the end
ah
as in like okay lah
eh but still
you don't have to worry so much about the guests you can just
slowly take your time
mm
ya fifty is too little already
you cannot that means it's really just family lor
right if it's fifty your aunties and uncles already dah fifty people plus your cousins
ya
oh my god then you have to do another wedding for the other side
huh why I feel sad leh
it's as not
okay
but do you feel want to be like someone's wife
do you still want to be like a wife like wedding aside
okay
I know I know there are just so many things
ah
ya
as in now what next
ah okay ya you should really take it slow enjoy being fiance fiance
you know I I was just listening to
I don't like the way they talk
on
ya no don't don't even bother I tried giving them a chance it just makes my blood boil
ya ya
I only listen to his podcast with aisyah his girlfriend aisyah aziz
it was okay lah but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like I think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like oh you know like if I have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows what his girlfriend is aisyah aziz
like hello
oh mm mm
ya
ya correct correct
and the chemistry is just not there right
like
mm ya maybe maybe but if you notice even during interviews it is dzar who carries the conversation right with the
people like razz will
a'ah
ya correct
correct correct correct
so actually dzar can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no lah
din doesn't add to the conversation I feel like he will just ask one question and then after that oh okay
no wonder he doesn't have like his own viewpoints to chime in you see at least dzar has like so many things to say right and he always makes the conversation more interesting
ya
ah ya ya correct correct
ah ah ah like what's the point you join right
can you hear me
ya I listen to CAPAW

um
you you know what I mean right
like oh what if you like suddenly you talk to your mother and then it's like then your mother's like

that's more ambitious than a private property
err ya ya ya
ya ya
where your farm lah farm farm
ya
ya
ya ya uh I don't know what is that called but ya the the buggy part
buggy
ya now I know now I know
you mean the wait you mean the buggy you want that big
oh
oh oh
ya like now like small
ya
okay just imagine a small house is already okay expensive eh then imagine a golf club
it's like
oh true
migrate ah migrate
ya
vacation house vacation
actually like staycation also can
ah ah ah ah vacation house ya ya ya like ya
I think like some people now also do like that
ya
um
no
never but but I ya I mean like now I don't have a lot of relative that stays um
ya so now like that's but then I don't mind I want to like have the experience
of like living in a
pulau ubin eh
is it like the model and I think
is it like the modern one ah I think I think they have I I think I got see before maybe not a lot lah maybe like a few
because I don't think it can last very long
eh then must wear shoe in house
my house lah my house
okay for me I like
leaning towards modern side lah kan
um I would love um private property lah
but ah landed landed property
but that's if I can afford it lah kan if not then hmm maybe
just a ya
ya dream my dream house you see
ya
because I just wanna be so that you know cause I like to have uh gatherings with like either like friends or family so I I like this kind of like interaction with the loved ones
ya so
ya so like exactly so that our house don't be like so like you know very quiet or like very like everyday like that
you see like that same same faces same like ya
ya but I mean it would be nice lah but of course the maintenance wise is different
so if I were to downgrade my dream house may um
um
I don't know eh because now the houses in singapore like small right like the house like very small so like
I would look uh towards the resale side resale house lah ya
ya mm
cannot get bungalow get that one can lah
ah like like jumbo like that ya that one also nice ya but again if I can afford
but now
ya I I heard it's still okay ya see the area also lah
I don't know eh wait
jurong that side is what area
west then tampines east
then north is central north lah
yishun
ah okay
okay
I know but I confused with the north south east west simi ya
um maybe more towards
north lah and also east
ya the east side and north side
because I feel okay the east side I like I like east side because like there's like happening there
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
ya
changi okay
ya
can travel
oh to then go to batam oh
mm
sidetrack sidetrack kan ya
okay lah more more I don't know ah
hmm
to travel to central
uh actually okay lah okay lah ah ya north north hmm eh actually okay lah for me like okay if I look at my where my parents stay eh
um
north is nearer
I mean okay we are I'm at the middle ah I mean now like my parents living is at the middle
but I would rather uh go uh to north
east
it would be a very long journey home whether I take train or I take bus lah
is it
ah ya lah ya lah I mean like towards the towards the woodlands ah the bukit batok
ya especially like uh the the khatib and that one yio chu kang that one like for real I feel like tomorrow then I reach
ya but okay lah
mm I mean central is the best lah
I say like for a dream house right the house to be like
mm ya lah
oh okay lah okay okay ya
mmhmm
ya mattar is inconvenient those that have uh blue line is quite uh
no lah no um because my my area don't have any line what I mean like the nearest is purple line and red line
ya
so all the blue blue line is like so far apart
like for me
ya
but we still no dot
we still like out of the region
mmhmm
right
ah it's always the issue
executive mansion executive is dubbed mansion ah is it maisonette
it's this big
it's that category ah
so executive
okay
what
ya
mm
okay now now that kind of house is I mean like um now the normal house eh resale house already like half a million already you know
like like my area my area is already five hundred plus plus K already
ya ya my my house is uh reach half a million already like above
ya like above above ya
I mean like they of course they have thoughts of like moving lah but then
not at the moment
ya
four
cause it's very long already sia it's like
thirty over years
and
I think because it's not say accessible but then like it's like we live at central central
um maybe
I say like woodlands or what right it will take less than half an hour
ya but if like you go by bus or what usually
ya more than half an hour like forty minutes
ya then like my area there I think because like
I don't know
no not a lot of things I think because it's balestier so balestier like
I don't know ah
like the outside part lah
not my my inside part got a lot of like elderly
ya especially elderly ya
but that but that house like wow
eh what what
why were we talking about it just now
oh okay ya
so mm so I think if like other area
um
of course like if if there is I mean like executive I don't think it will be below
ya
ya
like I like go for it already seh
ya then I'll be like very lucky
ya so I would go with like six or seven
one million ah
dude that one I might as well I take landed right
actually landed and
if if okay if I were to take landed and
executive right I mean it's it's not really far apart what right
then if I were to like work even a bit more harder or wait longer then maybe I can get a good landed
eh
I mean that if like is what I want lah
ya
ya I think our area this the central central is like already
ya
ah
mm
okay
that's why ya
because like I mean like especially like in our generation right we will take even longer to like pay compared to our parents' time
ya I think our parents' time
ya
mmhmm ya ya ya standard
high already
well tomorrow I buy
ya oh my god
mm
golf club
oh
I think you can
mmhmm
uh then
billion ah oh that's wah
wah
means you would be the richest there already
I mean if you were to
ya
a pool of
ya oh my god
I don't think it will be a mini golf I think will be quite big already
ya I think you can like fit in a few houses
ya
you can have your own cafe there you can have your own like what arcade there oh my god
oh my god ya it will be so
mm actually
ya it's just it's just here lah because like you know here four room kan you can buy like a landed at
mm
mm I think so
ya that's why that's why people a lot go to melbourne ah
or go australia that area
considerable
then you get a garden a mini swimming pool I'm happy with that already
I'm happy with that
uh you like will confirm go eh like you know that you have a vacation like stay eh you can just like holler at me
ya
I I have I have a friend

so like she was like saying
and the house is like err landed at
and the house is like err landed at then said eh you guys want to um go we can go just stay at my house lah

ah then after that we just like ah nevermind lah we just find another time ya
then now like all busy so like

then after that she have to like go first then the parents um err
left her behind lah I think no ah I think she was with the sisters
ya but I but she say that time she go first then the parents because the parents drive
so like
so it's like
ya I mean like it's best if like you know we can go with her then like
hmm but then ah
ya I I think everyone will like
bye singapore no no population sia
every time all all like go to malaysia
ya
but but in order to I feel like in order for us to like live a good life in malaysia
like we need to work in singapore
like our income must be from here then then we can live a good life there
unless you work very hard there lah but then it's hardly also to see
ya true
cost of living if retailers you could do as I knew
it's like the same like we live um staying in singapore ya
it's like times three of what we earn know
imagine if you earn one K and there is like three K

ah ya so like their parents actually like put aside or keep this savings of theirs
like uh for them so at a certain age then uh it will be uh released to them or something like that
ya so it's like
so so for example right now they work right they work hard already they earn like so much already
then at uh one point of time
you would they would get this money
but then this money is either is up to them lah what what they want to use it as
so
uh
so
ya lah they
um
they they have plans they already planned what they want to do with that money
oh that one I don't did I ask them
ya I don't know lah they say like at a certain age I think they also don't know I think I don't know
so like ya
err there's nothing over here what is it ah
ah
then
then suddenly aman need earpiece
my earpiece oh is it this one is it your earpiece this one
oh ya about tell eh do what
oh well
inside the container
inside the container container is this the container
black colour
black colour below one
orh
where is let me see before you give it to him okay
sorry it's okay bye bye
bye
then
then
and after then mm ya lah I think there's a lot of like then and then and uh so and so
ya
ya so so he already plan out lah like what he want to do with the money it's either he
uh buy a like a big house or he start on his own business
not most lah I mean like a few I mean like uh I have this few friends only so like
most of them okay I just say most of them like um plan to do like a business
or like maybe like go like overseas or something like um like their business is like
to ah
to
err overseas lah so like
it's just that they need
the the time to like get their money and then right that's it
it's like how our parents wait for their
but this one is like even
ya and you don't have to wait for that age
to get it ya you know
I think like
like when you reach like adult like mature mature adult age ah then they will like receive the money or something like that when like the parents know that
oh they can
they are mature enough to handle the money lah
ya that they don't even think
ya they don't even think of like what job they want to do after like or like you know they they like oh nevermind lah just we uh see how it goes
I'm like we see how it goes
I see where I go
like ya it's like you never know like they like oh okay lah see lah I think I think my father um
the the the friend
um uh son got a business so they thought of like you know just uh taking me in and work for them then um like everything is like already there the choice are there so they just need to choose
them I'm like wah so pampered one ya
so ya I think this uh I mean like most of these people
they'll they will like mostly do this kind of like investment or what lah
ya
see their background lah
ya
exactly
then like they don't have to like really stress or like put pressure
ya
ya
mmhmm
exactly
mm
just nice
mmhmm
mmhmm
degree degree
actually right
okay continue nevermind
mm
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm different
it's like it's like let's say like if you
in diploma right
then you have to work like extra to reach
to reach um the degree pay
ya then for degree
will just like that
then
degree itself is already like
sufficient you know
I mean
I don't know actually diploma is quite sufficient already
just that whether
um
ya because like I feel like because uh I have this uh conversation lah with my um
senior
like he's doing teaching
so he's not um under err not really under
ah private or something like that but he go to schools lah to conduct
the classes so like
then with that time that money that you earned you actually can like do a lot with it
so like like he do a lot of like um he just keep on doing like uh freelancing and like volunteering work and like just like
to
increase his err rapport or something like that
you get um what is that
ah
ya then after that he just like sign up for this one thing then that that thing that requires like degree
recommendations also lah and all so like he said like ya actually you just need to hustle on that I mean if you want a easy way but
the the going through process is like hard
ah then you take degree lah I mean like degree also now
like I feel like
ah
I mean it's good lah I mean it's good it's definitely good for like future because like even like when you are at work age or what right if you want to do something
it's like
uh like a bonus point ah oh okay okay this this person got a you know
like experience in this you know
ya that's why I was like thinking then like hmm but then of course um I want to do degree lah but
see lah how it goes
oh my god
uh as at that time I check
it was for one year eh for one year degree is around two five
two five
two five thousand
ah if for that one year
for that one year
ya because um half of the year
it's um overseas
uh labrador labrador
labrador park
I don't know uh uh I know what's the it's at uh australia eh
I don't I I don't know what's that
ya then like
but it's like so crammed lah like they say that there's no time then you have to do like
thesis and essays and such like that and then it's like not not like a few hundreds you know it's like thousands of words
ya I mean like ya lah of course lah but this one is like you have to do like
singapore one set then at the overseas one set and you just imagine that
then like wah but really like hustling ah then that's not
the only one then they have to rush for their
project works ya project works then like their on come eh accommodations over there
ya I mean it's paid lah it's paid but like our expenses and some of other things you need to use your own money
so like wah
so that's why people like sometimes use bank loan and stuff like that
which is like scary lah
ya
then what when you want then after that imagine after your degree you have to pay back
there's that
exactly then
thirty plus lah late thirties
means that the older you get the the older you get your
the older you get
okay
I mean like when you want to give birth the older you get
the harder it is I mean like the guy
this one about mental you know and emotional ah
emotional and mental um
don't know because of what maybe because of health issues because you're getting older or what
then
eh you can't continue continue eh continue the tradition or the the the
ya
I mean like both their different
uh pros and cons um a different
ya
mm
mmhmm
I mean it's okay if like the girl is like younger
ya
mm it's okay lah
ah lah ah lah
I mean it has been like that for the longest time lah ya
wah then that one I like really have to chiong you know I mean like
ya it doesn't matter like age doesn't matter lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
ya slack off
ya
mm
because of how you take the things lah ah how you like actually
uh handle the situation
ya like more more like career minded
ya
the pride ya
ya ya
ya
ya
maybe it's a trend also where people hire more females
they are more towards the towards towards the career path
ya I mean like before before this generation already like
towards the career path lah
where be like the economy and such right so
mm mmhmm mm ya
ya
true lah
mm
I'll be like
ah that's the thing
as in like ah saving plan
but it's also like hard lah I mean like how if that if you get like one
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
then how seh like that
mm ya mm
some like uh my friend
err
and be eh
two point five ya two point five then after that
ah got commission so let's say if like she
uh managed to like err sell something or this um particular plan or what eh to another company or what to an event
then she will get a commission of like another what one K plus or two
just imagine then wah she bring home how many already then like
then during this circuit breaker
like she still get her pay
but then um they give her more
she need to do extra
so usually like okay because like okay
the numbers of like uh workers also will cut down what
then after that the one that is being uh cut off
have have already have the thing to do so that that thing that the commission that the person has to do is brought forward to my friend
so she had to do double job in a way
ya so imagine like with her pay
okay lah her pay got uh drop lah dropped by a few percent only like not much
they've wasn't too which is cheaper
ah
I mean like if she get to sell um that's what the the pay pay the standard pay
mmhmm
so she have her own one and uh the friend commission
oh you mean uh the commission extra
yes
ya ya
mm
mmhmm
ah
like that ah
ya it's it's it's not it's not they combined the workload
so it's like macam if if combined also like if she managed to sell one thing
then she will get commission that one thing then if
if she go to the next list if she get to sell that next list then she will get another commission that kind
get what I mean
ah
so like now now she bring home like around okay
around three plus three plus four
err because like the err company really like cut into half
so so they have like two they they only have two um
two groups two groups of managing something
so now that one group
uh that two group is being cut into half and then they combine these two groups in a way
so it's like
because their their workload is doubled ah so of course their pay also in a way
doubled ah
amazing eh
like you like your leave you cannot just
then it like you really need to
ya but then she know ya that's why
but then she knows that
she need um income right so she stayed for a bit that's why the commission come in but then she say lah she say to the boss that
oh um you know um my my family is my first priority so if anything happen like if you need me
like last minute and I already have
uh a family thing or what
I will
I will not take up the work I will take up I will still stick to my uh family ya
they having this uh conversation and like this um argument and it's like about this thing ah then she said I'm so sorry I mean like
but then they know that they can't lose her
cause once they lose her then
no one would do that ah exactly
so they like try to like
what is that called accommodate lah
so like okay lah
then then in the end I don't know what happened but then she's still uh working there
but she said that she won't be err staying lah I mean like when when the COVID
thing gets better then like the pay don't get better then maybe like she'll go to another company or something like that but then again
the pay is already like
you know I mean I I won't I won't be
complaining ya
ya I mean if I would get that much pay and
I mean I already got the chance to like say um stay I never be like cut off then I really got like
then my pay in a way like increased because of the commissions
then like why why would I want to like complain even though that work is hard ah
ya
your what is that called
yes
getting better at this
ya a lot a lot
so
ya
that's why I think a lot of like people now want to like work really hard
and like have a stable life
will not have a
to go through like this uh
this like like what
we go through in a way but we don't know lah in in time to come like how it is like
a fellow let's say the future
ya exactly
but ya lah just that
I feel that now uh people work extra hard so at least they have something
to keep like in their that box
their treasure box
dead
their death box ya
so like really you really don't don't touch even like
even if got emergency also I don't I think they will try not to touch that money
I mean like unless
if the emergency is really emergency
ah
because because I know err I think err my my relative eh
so uh this saving eh that they have eh is for like emergency for like maybe
okay
urgent emergency
ya
eh don't be surprised I had my relative that got married at my age she going
she's the one like that you know
ya her her wedding supposed to be in two years
but that simple simple also need money what
then after that okay she have savings she have already have savings but then it's not enough
for that one year
weird okay
okay and they do not not together know like husband and wife
they do two separate wedding
so like the guy's side in a way I think is stable is okay
amazing but still like it's like lah I mean like
then then the mum on that day itself the mum was like telling us like
ah then after that into the point where uh where the mum have to step in the mum like
but she already
know that that thing will happen so she and the husband actually put aside and the father is actually very strict
then okay then that's a
that's why the father didn't know lah so of course the mum need to like mm twist here and there you know to make things like better
ya so like ya ah then the mum was like saying hais ah then this one also I have to like hmm
whole thing lah
so like if if the mum never help that wedding didn't happen actually
ya exactly I mean like you you I mean like throughout your life already like
burden already you know and then you have to err burden someone unless if your mum like your parents really want to fork out
like you know or help out ah
ah that is okay I mean it's like you know
ya it's like a gift lah a gift
ya
mm then okay lah ya
mm
ya
mm mm mm
ya I think it's
even my brother want to get married like want to make small small then she like
because like you know uh so we can invite more people like like her friends then he like stress
uh I think combine because the girl's family is a small family
because and she live in um
she has a family in malaysia and singapore so she she technically a
ya because she stays there
only she come here to work and also to meet the families here lah
and she have a family in singapore lah because I think the father or the mother is a singaporean
like not big so like so of course she said that she will only invite like those
like close one ah like the family in singapore lah
then that that that means right he really want to have a intimate wedding so with his side of place
then my mum like oh this is too squeezy then then later if I invite my friend like you know like mum's thinking like you want like you would want the friends to like
to share the happiness with the friends
then like he say but then who's getting married
he said ya then he like try to accommodate lah then my mum
try to understand also
but okay lah I mean like
different people different lah ah
ya like they they they know that okay uh this wedding
uh I want to do this for my child know I want to contribute err this part of the wedding you know for my child you know that kind of thing
ah renovation because like they are like getting older so like there are things that needs to be changed or what kan
like my this err aunty set like err
this big amount lah
ya but
mm
ya that's the thing
like some people join what this err what is that called
so after less interview of time
ya uh I mean no as in like every month if you like you pay
ah at a certain age then you can get the money the whole sum of money
ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
but err the but uh it's hundred fifty times twenty five
times the months lah
orh
mm
I think they have different different like
mmhmm
ya
but if sometimes like people know just have to go to another way
just to like
ya like like not not say illegal lah I mean like like legal
but it's riskier
uh I don't know
ya
ya I mean if you think that it's okay okay ah
ya
mm
mm ya
but this cannot be shared with you
um children ah if you if you have children
like this saving things you should not err I mean like
maybe
ya
until like they reach a certain age or what ya because it's scary because like they can you never know what will you know what they would what you expect them to do like

the one that I painted all cannot use because the paint smell very strong then if I tried I tried wearing it but then
like he did like that
ya
ya cannot
ya even after washing cannot wear cause it's very err smelly and all
so I've been searching up then they all sell like big big bottles one but I don't want big bottle I want like small bottle because like if I buy a big bottle there's no point for me because I won't be using it often

two thousand
ya
ya
but it's actually very easy just the organisation and the
because we have to cite all our work and everything so that one is a problem but but it's actually quite easy lah because I got all my articles already
the reflection is about just like um
the reflection is all about like emotional intelligence cause of my elective and then like the essays about like kids and then their development and everything so ya
no still have
ya I still have my religious school until next year

ya
no
ya
ya
I also don't know see what have lah what you cook or what's in the house
and then just eat whatever there is I think tomorrow will like
I don't think I'll be eating a lot also cause I need to rush my assignment like I maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
ya
ya
no eh no preference
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
um
bake it
oh
the old chang kee one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the ondeh-ondeh and the red velvet one
ya the ondeh-ondeh one
but it's like
the ondeh-ondeh one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the ondeh-ondeh because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was uh on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
ya
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the briyani with the potato also can
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the bhatoora like in the morning eat very nice ah but also like really oily
I think they like I ya they deep fried or something
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
ah got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like oh maybe can make hummus then we eat with we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying ah so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first uh
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
kunafe is which one
mm I don't think I tried kunafe before but I think I've heard about it before
the is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first uh I think like
ah cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
oh ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at joo chiat right like err that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
huh ang mo kio A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W oh no that one is shake shack
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
ya but I think I like it ah cause
I I was like in the mood for like just not
ya
ya
and uh
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know err during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for you know even their right the each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
so
ya
ya during december then err I also meeting like some of my err like
I want uh we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how lah because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then I cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed ah because like we all thought like err we all planned already and then like that night last minute uh that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her mah but don't know how lah see how
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel oh the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at jurong point anymore I only eat the
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
you guys can eat bingsu or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat lah but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things what
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it seh
if not
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
then
that time also
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people lah but you cannot like err four hundred dollars
ya
I think
err if not you can go bugis like the bugis haji area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to bugis street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's err like it's like affordable uh not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
err ya and then if not you can go to the that time the joo chiat
changi area
around her area
choa chu kang area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite ulu mah so ya
ya
that time I went with her at jurong east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like uh the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad lah but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
I want eat the I don't know I want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but I just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
I think five like I know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five five people
oh ya cannot refund right
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
huh if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go bali
indonesia
I don't think will have
oh I want to go the I want the indian sweet again the pink colour one you know the pink and white one I always eat then I want to buy one of the skirts again
ya but
ya that one that one the mango lassi very nice
oh ya
why suddenly got a lot of face wash ah
oh
I suddenly like I go back home right I like shower and then I was like okay and then shower shower I looked at the face wash area I saw like eh a lot of face wash then all the face wash was like the brand that
two face wash and then one pimple cream and then her perfume and her makeup stuff
ya

a friend

but then karina karina squishy lah bro but then
okay karina squishy
like at the start I always noob right then confirm at the start they will already say
a man of it the toxicity is not as bad as it was before oh but then ya and bangkok lah stop being a chicken dilemma
not bad not bad
the toxicity is not as bad as it was before but then ya
and
rank up lah stop being a chicken alamak err
where got I feel that level that time I saw you play okay what
okay what
okay the fact that you actually smash buttons I thought you actually did your research but I thought you nailed out on freya but okay
unfriend
okay lah
I keep on saying okay lah sia but okay
what okay lah
the rank the rank
I'm not judging I'm not trying to do it now but the fact that you already did a lot of research and thing it's a progress you can go up and up and up but
if you want to stay start then okay
win win the chicken dinner
invincible eh but if you want play fighter right I feel that okay there's this new fighter called yu zhong yu zhong
whatever
have another fighter eh but since you say you play freya freya right
freya freya has
why am I not surprised I am never surprise when it comes to this but
eh I really didn't know about the health spinning thing tho
wah okay okay cause right there was this like my team that time I play alone then I play with this one person
it's okay you can
you can you know improve that that ulti so instead of hitting minion you will hit
maybe three or four player you know
ya then
yet eh masha is not a tank masha is a is a fighter
ya I cannot tank
would you could that the
excuse me excuse me
eh walao I mean like okay I suck at new new heroes okay so like you know I'm I'm already comfortable with the heroes that I have

it's for you
ya hylos like ya
ya hilda and during
draft pick right they also
ya ya legit legit like they always did
or tank just odd ah and there's no one who'd ban hilda
so I think there's a good chance you can
but ya ya
they they ban uranus actually I played uranus before it's quite fun but
the surprising right they don't really much new players ya they bend your illness because actually you organise is a very thick thing
surprisingly right they don't really ban much new players
they ban uranus
cause actually uranus is a pretty thick tank
once in a while they will ban ling

they ban three each so each team ban three
so total six
players six heroes away ban
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay I really want andes I really want the fiery chicken oh my god okay I'm salivating
let's go find this but lunch lah
best pe
or like eh I'll be late
oh ya eh but wah the leave oh he's taking he'll be taking two days leave ah
okay now I feel very bad
ya whole day leave
lunch
no we're not bringing our rice cooker
oh
that's not happening okay we're not gonna repeat that
I can't really we bought a rice cooker for a staycation
okay this is such a
such a
feisty thing to say out loud
yes we bought rice cooker for our staycay previously and it was so it was so handy I admit though I mean come on man you gotta admit that it's very handy dandy
it's like what we cook maggi we cook pau we steam pau some more leh
okay okay no but we're not going to bring that rice cooker for sure
because over there right they already provide us with pots and pans
but ya we're not going to bring rice cooker
and no I'll make sure you don't bring your
freaking luggage
that's not going to happen because it's just
it's three days two nights so we're not going to have
a lot actually
I take that back I think I'm going to bring a lot of stuff also
luggage
okay okay then we
eh but the thing is we're going to eat lunch outside
dinner
it will be side tracked again actually in a way sort of
okay maybe not really
because right
okay I don't know
I'm actually imagining it right now
okay the fact that oh my god
haizat he fully endorsed it
I'm questioning our friendship why why are we friends with these kind of people
but
ya I wanted to mention that
pathetic
no I'm not going to do that
so it's like
the waking up though do you think
you think we will wake up easily
you nasty
okay lah if you don't you nasty
okay day two

okay it doesn't matter the order and then we going to do we're going to trampoline park
after trampoline park we're going to be all sweaty and disgusting we're going to go eat
I haven't do my research on that I ya I'm not as on as you
there's also I found one in ang mo kio before but I mean from here to ang mo kio is a bit like um but ya I thought if oh I know I know three one three lah
bounce kan ya bounce is there I don't know but we'll do research on that

container with aircon with all the things you need like
youtube netflix
what why go out okay lah I mean okay we're such a
party pooper
ya but
hmm
I was speaking of grab I mean coming from someone who reaches
an hour earlier than the meeting time every time

so it's like I mean I'm not even surprised if your account is not even gold
or silver to be honest or bronze
or below bronze but anyway
I'm so on to stay in container also
but at the same time okay if activity mm
if cheap and nearby I don't mind but it's at promenade promenade I don't know it's that far meh
I think okay you know what we just see if there's any like places nearby in prom line problem is it depends ah okay so the first option
first
first ten
first day
we just
stay inside
second day stay inside third day stay inside that's the first plan second first day we eat
go up and trampoline
go out and trampoline
on the first day I mean okay the first plan right it includes the gym also
because technically we don't go out what it's just that we go to the gym nearby the container gym anyway
ya we go outside which is first day we go
we don't we we stay in lah we stay in then second day then we go trampoline park then after trampoline park we can go back to the container
I don't know what other activities we can play
I mean even if we two car bejewelled and everything we stable soap mah like we still feel very icky instead okay ya then
ya
then
ya or we can go cow play cow moo first or wherever lah that first activity that we do and then we go trampoline park
and then we end the day with
going home for going to the going back to your container for dinner or we just buy dinner then we dabao to container
do not talk about my winx club like that winx club
that's not a very nice of you okay that's very mean move what's wrong with watching that I mean you watch barney you watch other stuff also so okay like cartoons are cartoons they are like entertaining
oh excuse me every single time I refer something about spongebob you be like oh I know that one you sure you don't talk much okay don't talk so much
if you don't watch spongebob and it's all memory based then how did it came about that means you did watch spongebob
excuse me sir are you judging all those people that are watching my little pony
no but the thing is right
the thing is our staycay we haven't even finish talking
you know what

and my name is haziqah
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay ah um just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today ah
ya so two more days before friday woohoo and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
oh so you go back to school all the way
wow we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
ah the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
oh I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause ah number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but eh actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having eh a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's uh I don't think that it is uh economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like oh hello good morning like greet them and then um scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so um ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like oh my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues ah they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
eh I don't know eh I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
wow
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like eh well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example lor then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like aww you got a forty seven oh I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on um students uh to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
um and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to um
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics lah so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like eh you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like oh english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue oh and like
oh and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like oh like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like eh you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
um only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena eh novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than err poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into ah mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching um teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where eh you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly what that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like um india or
at any
any colonised um sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce mmhmm scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that lah that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
uh I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this um having that divide you know uh haiti versus the dominican republic
puerto rican
wow
ya lor so
oh also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in jakarta per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their ah ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world leh even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are um there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around um say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them what at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that lah even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like oh it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like oh say like in primary school you don't have like oh you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then uh
I'm tired
stop yawning
wow okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
kaypoh boy kaypoh
mm
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue duh is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds ah cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with gingy though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
mm
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
oh speaking of that right uh there's this tweet saying that uh what ah
uh the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just uh what do you call it ah
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
eh doesn't make sense oh is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like um south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it

okay
mm
okay anyway
ah
minimalistic
minimalist
mm minimalistic
ah
ah
a'ah
okay you
ah
master bedroom
mm
orh
then
who know how to paint
hmm
frame
then
that separates the living room and the and the bedrooms
remember ah I want to make that wall I want to
what's that
they have the drawer
I want to tear that down
so that it's a wall flat wall
okay from bottom from top to bottom is a flat wall
of anything ah
ya
yes yes correct it's like a frame wall
because it's a
it's a walkway what
huh
mm
but I think
I think no need raised floor lah
then does it really have a purpose
then
quite isolated from the rest of the room tau to mingle
because the the house is big the hall is big
a'ah
and then the one behind behind the entrance
so if people sit there then you cannot mingle with the people there already
because it's across but then it's quite far
you understand or not
a'ah
ah a'ah a'ah
ah but we make it minimalistic ah
ah
mm
then I thought
I thought of having the minimalistic dining table like just a normal because the floor is marble what
so maybe matching ah
mm
mm
which bedroom the small one
mm
master mm
the second one is the second one smack you okay then
can
can
okay wait wait wait wait wait the first bedroom
then
you don't want to buy playstation meh
sure or not you don't want playstation
you don't use the space to the maximum you know

the raised floor is about knee length
okay
mm
okay
ah
mmhmm
ah
L
okay
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
laptop and all
uh huh
mmhmm
because of the weight of the
of the swing itself and
when you sit down you know

no the mount is just a hook whereby you screw into the wall
ya
then
ya ya correct
so actually by right right
we cannot move the
because there's only one wall
beside the gate
ya lah where you want to move it because
the main wall is right now the the main wall is beside the gate right and then and then after that uh beside that wall is already the window
so
you can't really move it anywhere
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay

jet spray

okay so I'm natasha and
whoa
the part ya ya ya before we hit the seven mark
yes you break the contract then bye bye
there goes the documentary that we've been planning
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
my most memorable meal
I don't have
oh
sometimes I still think about the bunny chow
right
ya I know like legit
so ya we had the bunny chow in
south africa cape town
and it is just
and that was great
why was it great ah I it was butter chicken it wasn't curry
oh
mm
poof
ya
is memorable right I think it's like the
ya and the area we were at was like
and I think it was also cause like maybe we were hungry
so that explains why
when when we are hungry everything tastes great and
uh huh
a'ah
a'ah
oh ya the customer ya
err I did we eat at another place after that I was I'm pretty sure
ya
I try to remember
ya
the burger right
perbezaan dia memang
what did you order from McDonald's I can't remember
yet
that was still much better no I think
cause we were given only ah ketchup packet at the particular McDonald's and clearly cause number one
malay number two
prefers spicy stuff
everything they had was like just not
not good enough okay
ya no McSpicy no nothing so of course we'll be like okay fine we try the local McDonald's but
ya so I took out the chili packet
next to the tomato ketchup packet then I'm pretty sure they were like someone was like where did this chili packet come from
just another day
I feel like we finish the chili packet on that one day right
everything we wanted we wanted chili chili
I think like we ate too much but
oh
mmhmm
it was basically
right
ya we ate samosa
kan
kan something like that
I think I I remember I took a photo
we went there twenty seventeen
three years
so I think there was
it was the thing
ya
ya
and cause of the slavery and all that and colonialism so a very different malay food lah
mmhmm
remember then we went to the shady okay not shady I'm so sorry but like the well-to-do neighbourhood and then we drove next to the train
then after you were like nata got train then I want to look but I'm driving
and then got the people waving from the train and then you were like nata look at there but I was driving
no it's not is it a pani
and then and then they tell us you wanna you want to half or you want the full and then I think then we so stupid we said full
loaded
ya there was fries there was um meat there was what cheese
of the full and then we were like ya one one uh beef one chicken so we got the full two full of the loaves right
and then we brought back and then we ate
and then we couldn't even finish
and then we
we ate like we continue
ya we can keep for the next day but we have no microwave
and and it was winter
you remember
a'ah
not
a'ah
ya
so we had
so like I think for lunch and dinner tau we ate lunch and dinner we ate that one
half
of course we won't we we spend much money on that
the next day for breakfast
kan
and then
ya and then like for someone like you also who can eat a lot also even that was like too much don't want to eat
ya cause the even the half right the half of that
I remember like I remember like why why this food came about was cause the food was for slaves back then right
ya then like it's just the one meal for that one day
like mm
cape town and they also oh it's called the gatsby
right gatsby ya so ya then the person also eat the gatsby
ya
but then I think like oh my gosh
think that was memorable in a fact that we couldn't finish
to be fair they tried to warn us
err speaking of anything stupid
that trip
yes
ya I don't know it's like there there's stupid thing was one of the things
ah we wanted to climb a hill it was called signal hill something like that so we took a Grab there
ya I remember we were quite sleepy ya and then
um the spot but it also seems like the spot cause it it just like the it's just the entrance of a
ah
and then it was almost at the top like I think like ten minutes before we reach the top that we realised that we were not climbing a hill but the actual mountain
and it was like
we should have seen this coming but also why was that man jogging
is it like same concept as bukit timah hill
ya and
it was quite high like
ah in fact yup it was challenging
and
there was ladders there was ropes and you had to climb the rocks like a big rock
and I remember thinking while we were there I like I kept asking you right like are we sure this is the hill and then we were like eh
maybe their hills are like this
and then we reach like almost ten minute maybe five ten minutes before we reach the top
then we realised we can actually use our phones
so we googled
we I think no I think I look at Google map like where the heck are we and then Google map showed that we were on lion's head mountain and then we were like what and then we googled lion's head mountain and then we reached and then by the time we reached the peak already and then we saw the sign lion's head mountain peak six hundred is it metres six hundred or something metres above water
ya
ya
and
ya
surreal
ya
ya I remembered that
that so stupid
so we entered the wrong entrance lah basically the the Grab driver confident thought we wanted to climb the freaking mountain
and I also think
hiking stick
I think they were tourists also
ya and they were clearly ready they had water bottle
ya no the first thing we did was get a Grab go back to go back to our place drink water
ya
what a morning
what time did we leave we leave the house I think six or five five or six
and think we went back like eleven right
ya we we rested for like one two hours I think so
the city
we we climb the mountain
okay to be fair our view was very good also
ya okay
ah that that's the plan ah that's the plan ten years down the road
so
two zero two seven
return to cape town
we we find a life there right
before we die when we finally get employed
hais
you told her
okay but to be fair I told you you can have done your own things
what
cause of my mum right she wanted to donate all the mosques
eh but to be fair right we hit we hit up all the mosques
like it was quite surprising that there was
ya and then like cause it's also like
like basically we were just exploring the city lah cause we hit one end to the other end to the other end
it was all walking distance right
uh huh
uh huh
ya even though it was basically just to deposit money
I know we did like
we we bail out
ah what else
okay how about we start with food
we we went there for the exchange and the exchange for like a few weeks right ya
um south africa
and then the field trip the accommodations my god
ah the my god is a very good my god not like a bad
I mean to be fair they took all our money also
I mean safari we imagine I'm assuming people will imagine like flat lands and lions which we did
ya
so in terms of the safari let's see what what food I just want to think about the food
oh ya I think cause we were at the coast
ah yes the ostrich
we were at a ostrich farm
ya
so the meat that we ate were the ostriches we saw that day in the afternoon then we ate their brother
ya
no particularly memorable food per say
ah ah ah
you know cause these americans
just just saying
ya and
ish
they not mature yet
ya so like
ya a few and other from right with a few other singaporeans and then
the
ya
woohoo that kind of thing but then we went in like meh we just make new friends I guess in this new
van
a'ah
avoid
ya and not only that we sacrifice one another like sacrifice ourselves
to
ya
ya ya
I think he enjoy it lah
ya I mean got to be fair
he is a bit questionable but whatever
yes
with him never mind don't need
we had fun
ya he's like natasha where's my photos
ya the food wasn't much to say but ya the people
kayaking in the river right
ya I that one I don't think I will forget cause I had to partner with the guy
and then everybody didn't want to paddle next to our boat so everybody just went ahead of us
a'ah
yes
yes I remember
I remember scolding him
okay what else did we do kayak
the reserve
oh my god
the cave
I was just talking about this to my friend tau
you know the other day like it's one of the few things that I will remember for life getting stuck in a cave
hais
I mean to be fair I warn everybody I was like telling them I feel like I will confirm get stuck cause I have no eye-hand coordination
let alone with my legs I no coordination whatsoever so I will I think I will get stuck in the hole
everybody laugh it off
and then what happened
I got stuck in the freaking hole
ya and then at then during dinner I still remember someone like do you that someone was stuck in a cave and then I was over there ya that was me
then she automatically oh really I'm so sorry
ah okay hmm
a cave
mm
the highlight reel
you know hunger games then got the cannon boom
eh
do you want to see another prompt

okay
one skill
um
one new skill
hmm
ah I know I want to learn how to ice skate
for no reason whatsoever but just to have fun
I asked
ice
cause kaysa does ice skating
apparently her whole family does
okay anyway ya but like she said I think she said like inline skating is kind of
but I'm still assuming it's a new skill
so ya I mean that will be very fun
ice skate at and then amy amy follow but then amy almost died
so ya I was like ya if I live somewhere
where there's a lake
I would definitely learn and there's winter I would definitely learn how to
ice skate for fun
that be fun
two more skills

no no but err okay lah that time I order also he he got my order quite well so okay lah
it's funny how like this is one of our first few time seeing a male
shopkeeper
I I prefer it that way seriously because ya cause if not it's causing inconvenience to other people
no like you eating people starring is fine but if you were to eat and laugh and like jer take your own damn sweet time yes you deserve to be skewered
I think that time the first few times that we went was when we were in school and it was no no it was after lunch hour
okay either way is before or after lunch hour it's not during lunch hour so you can still eat and talk ya
I think we we bought from there before
mm mm mm mm mm

mm
mm mm mm mm
ah yes lah
no you that's the thing you know when it comes to this kind of health issue kan sometimes you can be really healthy and all that but it will still happen to you
all this while
so that's the thing ah like he's always been like exercising if he's not running he'll be cycling you know that kind of thing
first thirty years of his life
oh ya ya forgot
actually I don't know because I only know them I only know him from twenty six years and above
but you never know I very I very scared like I'm always get go home girl checks is like
no lah you just tell it for yourself or for your family lah the I think that's about it
mm
mm mm
ya
mm
mm
it was really tricky ah ya I would suggest him like go go and meet a dietitian or something so that they can look at meal plans
mm mm mm mm
damn
mm gym-ing I don't know
maybe that's how they see it as a form of motivation ah
mm
mm mm mm

oh okay okay then you need to rethink I buy my clothes every six months
serious
ya I know but it's like okay for me is when I buy I will buy like
ya lah I think design sizes it's it's all together mah like you will see something that's in your size by it's not what you want and it's you know you want this particular design but the size is not available so technically you'd mm just see which one is um
I know right ya
need to rethink my life decisions you know now that I'm going to be thirty one soon

mm
ya must wear in case like people from the other um you know rooms come in to talk to you and all that and then you don't have your mask on it's really to reduce the chances of you ah getting that lah

ya ya ya ya ah ah
ya
ah
then like and then I'll be like
adela I
ah
it's really a big country problem you know like for us it's just so easy
they also experience bad reception leh and then they keep changing because for them is they don't use line they use top up so they can change telco every now and then kan
ya
video
mashallah

all the best girl
okay
oh my god girl have fun with the pap smear man it hurts like a bitch
oh my god it was painful I was like just
oh my god
ah
feel so hurt
eh but it really hurts ah it really hurts and the doctor
it's everyone what but the good side of it is is once every five years
okay you do it now five years later then you think about it
not fist lah
what do you mean by lube
oh lube L U B E no no no no it's not it's not about lube
then to open need it is ya so the open part is the one that's painful that one they will always use it
do you just like
no no it's once every five years so it's really good like I've checked then they said mine is negative so okay lah
ya
it depends lah like I have high tolerance for pain and I actually like
ya ya correct
mm mm
ya so no worry lah I think should be okay
ya even my mum did pap smear
no actually pap smear that time cause wanted to check err about her the ovaries her uterus
then I was like
and then the lady just the reception's like madam fadilah I was like miss
ya single mum or what the husband is just not caring enough to accompany her and all that
mm mm mm
ya
mm and she's really young I mean I was sitting beside
and but I had my ears plugged but
ah Spotify off
and
ya and but the the girl was crying and the mum said it's okay we wait for what happens after this and then we'll figure out what we'll do after that okay
ya
so like then I didn't say lah I just keep quiet cause I I'm supposed to be listening to music remember
ya
but ya it was like interesting ah
mm
mm mm
ya you very common
damn girl
damn damn
eh eh
mm
seventeen
mm mm
I I no okay lah I I think that point of time I was like I need to get the top five in class you know that kind of thing like
ya oh my god
but I feel like for them like sexual education had to start like really early you know
then throw outside lah
not strong ah
it won't it's like quite tight so
like if you're not ready to have a child then do something about it like make sure you don't conceive
ya
ya so I think a safe bet would be like after you done that surgical procedure right maybe you wait like a month first and then after that you or maybe after menstrual cycle
mm mm
ya
orh okay
I mean it's good lah then she has options you know that kind of thing
catch ball mah that's why
oh my god

ah less drama more fun
so when it comes to secondary so all this while

because she is going to cover everything within all her periods and everything and during that time we have young entrepreneur scheme competition
I also imagine like primary one primary two primary three and primary four
everyone was in the same class
uh
and also the lower class lah
antisocial
okay then
ah ah I hold grudge
so it was like primary five primary six secondary one
ah level one meaning
oh

I'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now I saw this job search
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area
no ah but
to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan lah at least
then after that
okay so
um okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post what
so obviously there's fan
like how how rude is that like I just want to know if there's aircon eh
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan what
I doubt it will open
ya I miss I miss going there then like talking to the kids even though they are annoying
but I don't miss the managers
sorry ah like
ya that voucher
but you got use or not
oh ya ah
but you can ask him to follow you what
right

ya so
after

that's why so
like what's his reason like
to go out
you never ask ah
oh my god okay
so right okay
ya okay so
okay err when I started um
maybe
ya last two weeks
okay okay so kan actually
ya okay so
err sarah said it's obvious lah and then I was like what do you mean it's obvious
then she said um most most of the time if you go out with your friends you will say the name
but then today you just said you going out then I was like huh
what's mama's problem lah what like why she keeps on calling us like
she said curfew at one so why are you like bothering us around twelve
dude like our curfew is at one
but then you act as it you are the err special child you know like
mm
like mix of both so like there's bad and good lah
like it's zeko's story but then how come zeko
told aisha then end up like mama know you know
huh okay then I was so pissed
so I went to expose one of aisha's secret lah
then after I exposed then after that err my mum was like
illegal gathering lah then I was like okay whatever
err mariam did you tell mama that
then she was like err mizi told me
so apparently she go text aisha eh she go text sarah she said
why must she tarnish my name by saving her boyfriend's name
technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
it's just zeko's ranting to you then end up you have to tell mama about it
how to say ah like she always talks about her friend's problem but then she don't talk about her problem
she
she go use my
like
I will throw your nike inside the water
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it

okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
cause
I I won't say it's okay ah but
I don't know lah I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay lor but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm one then
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
no
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and aisha our shoe size is not that
like comfortable
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me

those kind of
ya

and then before you reach there after you pass by lim chu kang lah whatever shit
you have to turn in
so it's exactly like that except last time it was one way now it has become two way
but there is no light no nothing whatsoever
then as we turn right on our left side it is old estate
from there
ya it's empty
so so they mentioned that that place is uh for those fisherman
then I say I don't want I don't want fahmi go okay
and then you know I never say there and then but the stench oh my god is fucking smelly
the smell damn smelly it's damn bad
then we go
on the way there
on the left side
and there
I saw and then I was like
eh
then like that again at the corner of my eyes it's just like that again then okay
then I said eh no face eh
cover only eh
then I'm like oh okay then I think because I experience it in the car
and then with everyone
okay
okay I didn't see the face

ya
correct or if I saw it alone
then I would be like shit
so I just like uh okay
and fahmi was so nice to send everybody home you know means canberra woodlands and then my house kallang
and then we go back
so I scared
like how I want to answer my mother
my mother will scold me what
sia I don't know what to answer my mother siol
but you ever have like you know goosebumps
huh
ya it's like a figures more shadow
whoa
you got you know there is something there
what do you mean by dancing
siol ah
eh eh house
ah
ah
mm
oh
uh huh
uh huh
small sink
okay
mm
uh huh
uh huh
ah ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
it it was moving
like you see the arms and all
ah ah ah ah ah
dishes
ah
oh oh
but you know if you think properly
you are blocking them you know
then the way you shout is obvious that you saw one thing
no
uh
ah ah
oh
hello
mm
okay the master bedroom toilet okay
ah
correct correct
ah
hey
okay why is it right your first instinct is to turn to it not to not
turn away from it
I saw you first
train
wah until now
until time ah
no but like at that point in time ah
oh
whoa
wah so weird leh
anabelle
oh shit
that one dig out the eyes
mm
ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
at the side table lah
okay when you say that there's obviously something
one last ah one last
ah
wah irritating ah playing around
ah
ah ah ah
correct correct
whoa
wah
short eh
scare yourself first
ya
exactly but how they are the one doing the task tau which are brushing the teeth and washing the dishes
don't
and then have you heard any in okay let's not touch our own club because like we don't want to scare ourself like that
no
don't know
okay in our club obviously there is lah but like I just choose to ignore it
because like I'm gonna work there for very long time you know like witch we work together
but you've never seen
ya
ya
like you what me you what you want me to do like
but hundred bro
bro hundred is fucking real bro
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred is last time right tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
that is like I think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
mm mm all the way down
ya so like the the part where
uh
ya like
ten O two
ya exactly
so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall
and then
ya maybe so
with me
then there will be two of us correct
so I was telling him that
we haven't open then I follow him so that okay let's say ah
one row of treadmill
dock
pillar
shit right
to me right okay
that is real too because you really show yourself
have more extreme one but I just feel like don't want to tell
K the less extreme one
uh you know how trainers are very tired
do you know how trainers are very tired right
and then they will sleep
they will have a nap
so lasiri was sleeping
there is a scientific reason for all that what
then
when I say cannot ah will say no bro
sitting on top of me damn big
so so she's a trainer what so she went to this one guy
hey bro
how you know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone I will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then I feel like eh maybe real siot
kan
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the the weight at night
that gets angry
uh ya same
and then they'll be like
hey
come ah fetch me at my place ah hey cheebye after you tell me all this you want me to fetch you at your workplace you okay or not okay
mm hoo
so ash wanted to tell us something about it
because
she started working there
we didn't want me to start
no the thing is no no the thing is like people who work there for years already must have told me everything
got so many things to say meh
oh
ya lah but then it's not from experience already mah
it's a pass it down
ya
ya the one at club ah like our our place she you already had gone ahead then confirm
ya ya ya ya ya
right
really
for

you always have to go to level nine
I will go down to level nine go into the main changing room to check everything okay in the dark then go to I apple mac check because I lazy right go rate it that's it okay then I will go to the counter and on the light
okay now open the shutters late the wasted at the counter on music
okay auntie come okay then I check
no but the thing is when I first came in
nurul also just always scare me all this shit what
ya

ya
ya but then they action ah I come down
I know you know what I want lah but like you just give me
ya lah
ya lah my entire life sia I've been staying here and I only eat the same thing all the time ya that's why they do what you want
you at least pretend lah
even from far you know from far
uh huh
or maybe before going to work you should buy at gado grill
oh my it's peak hour
why you don't like gado grill
you're not gonna eat that now what you're gonna eat that at three
no wonder you specifically ask me fast food
ya also want to eat shaker fries also

ya but like I'm so hungry now
no ah the market you have to go to the left side a bit
but it's near
it's near ya allah it's near
ya
I have but I look big in other colours so I don't want to wear it
ya so I only wear those when people come over to my house
ya
I'm thinking if I should get something from old chang kee you know like uh

cheese
ya popcorn chicken and then they add in cheese
ya
but like I feeling fries actually you lah you mentioned shaker fry
ya sia
shaker fry
because right they say well what what day is it

ya but like the bigger is the better you know the bigger the better
no and then like
oh ya forty five
ah ah
eh ya
orbid
too cute
so cute sia
ya
yes
oh grey
so actually what you gonna eat later ah
like malay food I would not recommend ah it's like to me like cannot make it
only their breakfast
mm not really
oh I found I found a place okay everything in there is halal
kallang way
so they have like korean they have everything japanese
and they follow okay two veggie one
meat three dollar eighty cent
cheap right they really follow the economy style
downside is it only accept cash
ya
uh then ah old chang kee accept paywave
ah
I think what
cause
got waffle also then I just feel like I want to
no lah
how the heck are they going to fry the waffle
wow
wow like the double down something like that
mm not bad
waffle is swensen no no the thing is I cannot with swensen
the food is not great the service is low
I cannot ah swensen is just so meh
I would rather
you put me at pizza hut
rather than swensen
choices ya
oh
then got kid's meal meal then there's also the
oh
but do you know the swensen soup in the bread if they put sourdough then I'm like shit
uh uh
the bread is the sourdough
uh it is it's just a very wheat bread to me
uh uh
uh pizza hut they have one day this meal they call it
curry zazzle
I don't like it also but then that is the only thing that is spicy
so like I have to eat spicy food right
and always because when I go out right I feel very very very hungry I can't even wait for the baked rice to cool down I will end up burning my tongue
wah means you reach work swee swee sia
I no time to this one know
cannot no time I know lah every time go work
from here I know
ya it is near you know right from my house when you walk when you want to walk to the that's really like if you walk relax seven minutes if you walk like me
four minute
then I usually wait for the train like one or two minute
then it takes another eight minutes to raffles place from raffles place to our workplace ah that one is the problem
outside where then jaywalk
oh then you can walk
you quite smart hor
I've never thought of that leh
wow
shit
okay

a'ah
a'ah
um
um ya
ya uh um ya so
ya
wait wait wait
err
ya so they will say I wil tell you the number one nine seven two ah fifteen minutes later I I fill the number and tell me again then writing again right ya
ya you know that you are actually
ya do you know that actually are you are supposed to
so it was at the mild stage right you should
gotten it diagnosed then because if you get got it diagnosed then then doctor can frequently follow up but they cannot just do ah the
err what actually dementia you can see from their brain that it is um they having dementia lah but because stroke also can cause you to have some deformities in the brain say dementia is still like a mental condition right they have to do all test there like depression schizophrenia all these they still do test
like verbal assessments you know but
the project
you know they don't
you better but there's no need to stop
we
know
so people
that version
you can got you involved
if means that you need to do
want to
we we talk
we
um
kid
ya I know
you know
mm
I
ya but
you are already tired from work then you go home your parents not to say burden but you have to give hundred percent dedication
um
oh
but sometimes
ya so like if there is something like that I think it's very attractive lah because some is an enclosed space so you can come and visit your
you wanna have a village like that it has to be somewhere that is already developed that still needs more developing like nursing um
ah
ya
the mmhmm
there are because like if they know then some people might take advantage of it
ya
ya
ya
I think
but if you have um your rental flat that is above it right that studio apartment that is above you have two hundred to four hundred unit eh two hundred unit so two hundred units
but because her dad like everybody has err I mean maybe not just singapore everybody
temple is a hindu temple
you know but how about the buddhist how about the carton how about the christians how about any
ya lah
mm ya
I think
mm ya mm
mm
mm
I'm not
that kind of thing then um then like then
a'ah
ya so like or don't no and then I feel maybe
mm
oo
I think there are a few points that be
take away from here is the number one
because
ah
mm
but
but it's just me like I because I don't like to travel so you are convenient lah that I'm already at my house like that
ya so
mm
mm
mmhmm
you think you have
um next ah what
I think
so far from what I learned about this are taking care of a being a secondary caregiver or living in the same household right
a'ah
what I think
ya like
that's the main thing that's the main thing ya like you have to always be prepared like because the thing is for progressive condition right
then you move on on on you
so you like you're drowning you
I try to swim okay let me ah see how I if I can go and get help it really is that they're getting help
ah swimming is trying to move forward right is really paying like you really can't and sometimes when you want
mm
it's like um
you know why I believe that it is not working I would like to close the case I would like to go somewhere else then you you have to be let alright I will close the case and then
what for the um for the
professional sometimes if they feel like the case is not is not going smoothly it's not working out they can actually feedback to their supervisor and be like I'm sorry but I think this case any if not working out you know
you already have that bond and the attachment
and for professionals that is that boundary
ya
mm
mm mm
ya
ya you guys are doing experimenting on your own you know like that's what doctors want it's because doctors are not there twenty four seven
sometimes doctors are also like unhappy lah like you want you keep the medication here medication there but it's just that dementia is so different that dementia is not
ah
mm

okay I'm working at like uh as an admin at tuition centre lah then err
uh the hours are not very long for me I think it's not very hard also and the pay wise is okay for me also it's not very tiring also ya lah
uh that's for weekdays lah then weekends like I get like ten dollar per hour so I think it's okay
ya
but the hours like
mm mm mm
any complaints uh any any situations that happen that you can share
ah
ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
citing play any place that thesis my senior
mm mm mm mm
mm mm
you all
you all straight up ignored him or what sia
oh damn
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
suited switches waited until like someone call him to
mm mm mm mm
your max ah
ah ah ah ah
ya lor in my opinion also I feel like
ya
ah ah
ah ah ah ah uh huh uh huh uh huh
okay lah but if you're working in this sector you need to expect this kind of people also
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
what parents
I mean I'm quite lucky lah right now they my my my tuition centre the parents are all quite okay not really those demanding ya they're all chill
but I mean I mean they're bound to face this kind of
bad parents also but I think overall is okay like
what I want I wouldn't complain anything about it lah everything is everything is gucci
ya ya
so what you're planning to do for your full time now
mm mm mm
ah
what kind of careers can you like get from this course though
freelance is it
oh cool okay
which
ah which company
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm oh ya but during your course of study got intern or not ah
so mm
is that related to your course though
ah ah
mm mm mm
your cup of tea
mm
ah mm mm mm mm
mm oh the standards is not very high there
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
words mmhmm
mm
doing mmhmm
but I feel like singapore these kind of things is not very exposed like media things going on so like a bit hard lah for you right
mm mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm understand understand
full time jobs and then as you were saying regarding like not what you want but more to survival yes
ya take whatever there is mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
culinary
mm
ya that's true
mm mm mm
uh huh
ya it's true mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
ah but from this situation also like a lot of thing was affected like we can't even like travel anymore or like go to concerts and stuff like that and I don't even know when will we
fun things like what
mm ya
mm oh ya all these are all affected
mm
and to see but the
how to sit and apple
ya
mentally physically
mm
mm mm mm
but also depends on each person lah because like some people are like you know they're the extroverts and
introverts but then the introverts will like appreciate this point of time because of like they all just have to like constantly stay home and not have to like meet other people
bad for us mostly to the extroverted side that one can affect us like a lot
err yes but I feel like I've changed honestly I mean I told people that I'm an extrovert but then like the other time I took the test like I've changed
I mean I'm still an extrovert but some factors changed so I mean I don't know if like it's possible for our personality to change like that
I don't know I feel like cannot wait so from what
you're still extroverted right
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
ya
mm
mm
like I feel I feel like as we age ah and then we find ourselves to like keep
we find to keep to ourselves more not as much as we did like last time when we were younger
ya sometimes it gets draining so we need like time for ourselves like for awhile maybe one or two days then after that we can go out again
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm ya I understand
mm hmm mm
mm mm mm
but right now I feel like we are slowly getting back to how we were last time though
like crowds are not so crowded but people are coming out more roads are getting slightly busier and stuff like that so I think
it's quite of a slow moving but we are still going back to our way lah but it's just slow
mm mm mm oh my god ya
everytime I see such videos I feel very blessed to be in singapore honestly but then like you know cannot put my guard down also cause we don't know what might happen anywhere
mm
mm our blessings
mm mm mm ya
ya ya ya
mm mm mm
so we have some parties who are willing to talk about the minorities right mm mm mm
a change lah
progress
mm mm mm
mm
close minded lah
mm mm mm
I think I uses an enormous
such matters
but I feel like when I go online I mean when I go online I see like people are quite vogue ah about all these matters but then come to come to think of it social media is most likely just like the youngsters
my our generation but then like still singapore is mostly made up of the older generation also who are still stuck in this kind of like mindset
so and then it's they make up most of the people in singapore I mean
overall then still singapore is still considered quite close minded and traditional lah due to some of their thinking those are their thinking
but then like you know I see social media all then like all the youngsters all that one is like
they quite okay quite woke but then like you know it's still just a small what percentage of singaporeans ya
mm mm
thinking
mm
mm
mm mm mm ya
mm mm
mm mm mm
but I'm glad that some of the percentage of the votings for the elections was also
made up of younger generations so that one actually like kind of assured me
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
what
ah flaws
uh huh
you know what same girl
bedok ah ah
actually I never try before
mm
mm
mm
mm
I've been wanting to try that though I've always seen people post like this online
what do they sell though western is it
mm
ah I'm craving for pasta now
mindset
you started it
ya we have to eat
okay lah porridge I had a breakfast I mean to me I like ah but I think
I mean not really I mean um I think my taste buds more of the older people kind of kind of taste buds ah but
I mean I'm not really a porridge eater but this porridge is not bad ah
kind of one of the top one I mean not top but one of the good ones
mm it's been long is it
but I thought you work early one you don't have time to get this meh
wait so when you work you start at eight correct
ten minutes for the whole shift
eight to five right
uh huh
mm oh
you should have girl
oh that's true
you're not a morning person
mcgriddle oh ya oh you like that
ah it's not a fixed menu ah
I don't know to make people want it lah
to me personally I feel like it's too heavy eh for my liking
huh you eat light you will not heavy
wrong with you ah
ah
huh that's so god damn weird
ya ya the egg and the cheese is there cheese in it
oof god damn stop it girl we hungry
oh I don't know that one I'm not sure
anyway tell me about yourself like like how you from
from secondary school from primary school until poly like we met in poly correct
we met in poly and then I mean I didn't think we had a chance to get to know each other also
like we mostly met for like
ya for our tasks and things to do not at our own timing so like I think we can take this chance to like you know
anywhere you can start ah anywhere you can recall
wah sis you know my my memory sucks lah so
I don't know girl anywhere
mm
oh
ya so I announced it go you know okay ya such as
so how many years of floorball did you play
four years oh from sec one eh
wow
wow
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
how
mm
oh my god
mm I know I know I know
I keep it out they are used
mmhmm
oh my god
ah
ah
did it actually work
so what you bring it for your practices ah
uh huh
then
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
but in school you use the school stick ah
but for competitions do they provide sticks or
oh so in the end you still bought lah
class fund
oh eh ah
edusave eh
ah
mm mm mm mm mm
mm
so you prioritise the uh
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm
so your for your school floorball was it an all girls or mixed
oh there's two floorball teams
mm
mm
oh so you improved a lot ah
mm mm mm mm
mm
mm
why though
looking be scared probably isn't it
ah
mm
mm
did they like dislike you
hatred ah oh acceptance from that
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
mm
to join you lah
mm mm mm
for me I I tend to like you know get myself into like
this kind of things lah like if I see your personality is like something that would bring drama to my life I'll be like
okay I'll just like you know distance myself from you
so like for me drama is like really I don't really face dramas ah
ya like even okay the most I've ever had drama in my life was
poly but I it's not me it's like people in the class I wasn't involved at all the people was in the class
and then like they were talking about it I mean I hear people talk about it but I'm just like
okay you know like whatever let go I'm the type to like if you don't do shit to me then I'm okay with you ya
as long no matter what people say about you ah so as long as you treat me right then I'm okay lah so like I mean
that's how I feel like I came with like a no drama life ya
it's not even me drama is like my class drama you know that kind of thing
and then the class drama and then they all talk about it that's why I can got to know about it what
if people don't talk about it I don't think I will even know about it
mm
the floorball is it
mm
mm
mm
I think that's what happens when you put a lot of girls in one place
mm
mm mm mm
get through with it
uh huh ah ah ah ah
mm
mm
mm
oh so you guys were sort of like the junior team is it
mm
mm mm mm mm
oh math was the only one you failed
but
oh okay
mm mm mm mm mm
so neat
so did you like ever thought of like continuing your floorball things in poly
really I never hear sia
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
oh okay
life skill
I feel like sports is like you have to have a passion for it lah if not it's like really tiring for you
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
oh floorball
that is going to affect your grade more sia
exams
oh my god O-level
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
but I feel like sports also especially floorball in singapore it's not really a um
really
mm
mm
mm
really
mm
mm
mm
I mean it doesn't as someone who's not very involved in sports I I never hear like
I mean person as someone who's not very involved in sports I mean I never hear like
floorball before lah in singapore ah like a popular way
weird why
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
ah oh ya
oh ya we had the camp
huh
really
vibes ah
mm mm
but I think we achieved quite
a lot lah from our time there
which one the flower
I don't remember sia
mm ya ya ya
I think for me I think I've a lot of ideas in my head ah but I think executing part ah
that one is not for me ah
that's true
mm
I feel like also like we all as organisers we have other commitments also
and then like it's not necessary we're not full on committed to this role of ours
and then I think that's one of our flaw lah
why ah
oh oh why though ah
why ah
oh ah ya ya ya
ya sia haiya
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
tertiary is what secondary ah
oh primary secondary or poly ah
for me I think okay the most time I enjoyed will be
primary school but then the thing is like primary school I was like really young so I didn't have any like
secondary school wasn't really good for me poly also
poly was aite but I wouldn't say it's very good also
ya so I don't think my education was a kind of a fun time for me lah
so I would choose the primary school lah cause like it's the most
unproblematic ya
anyway let me tell you all about my school life
so for primary school right I was from ahmad ibrahim at yishun
so it was like a kind of fun thing because like you know like if you no money or what just go staff room
and then like but I was
in ahmad ibrahim for just three years like primary one to primary three
and then after that uh I moved to serangoon so I had to transfer myself so I went to pei hwa at sengkang
so that was when I had like
so eh no pei hwa was secondary school sorry I went to anchorgreen primary at sengkang
so that was where oh wait I haven't with you yet so I'm at ahmad ibrahim right I joined
err skipping rope skipping
and ya it's a rope skipping and I was unexpectedly amazing at it
like I was quite popular in primary school just for being like the top rope skipper
like I don't know why but like our sports day there is like even a rope skipping sector for it
like is like you either rope skip the fastest or like you like
run while skipping that kind and like
is and I always win first no matter what level is that
and like I don't know why like I found my talent there ah and then we joined like skipping competitions like
even though I was in primary three only I already knew how to like you know the double double skip that one and then like
as someone who's like super short is like quite unexpected for me to be good in this kind of sport lah
and then considering I did it although it was just three years I
thought I would grow but I never
but rope skipping is
jumping eh so I most of the time jumping but I don't know why I never grow lah
but anyway I managed to join in my three years there I managed to join one competition
which I don't really remember what how we did cause it was like really super long time but I remember like rope skipping in front of a lot of people
and then like
I was with like the seniors and shit and then like everyone was kind of tall there but I don't remember seeing locals it's most of the time like foreigners
but I think I did
I think I did quite a good position at the
the time for the fastest skipper ah that one
I think I got I think I did quite for that but I really don't remember how it went ah
ah I think so
I think so but I really forget sia I forget I just remember skipping super fast I was like
and then after that err okay that's all then my primary school was
err skipping lah then after that I went to anchorgreen sengkang
and then that's at sengkang and then there I joined dance
dance ya join and dance but I did chinese dance but surprisingly until now I still cannot do a split
ah
ah no we have three types of dances all
ah we have like modern dance we have chinese I don't know why but I was put into the chinese dance ya
and then there's like those things and stuff and so unexpectedly I didn't expect myself to be an okay dancer also so from primary school I got
an interest in dancing lah so that's when I like find out myself about dancing and stuff
so ya primary school was one of the most memorable ones one I would say
like no problems at all no dramas and shit and like everyone's just like
vibing so
ah ya lah those lah ya just for fun
really
from what like
just like interest uh huh
personally I feel free styling is like
hard sia for me
mm mm
because it's up to you also what right ya
okay
ah
err for me I don't know eh I feel like those
type of things you know there's like contemporary and shit for me I don't understand eh this kind of dance like I don't
see it being nice it's just like people moving around the body is not I mean it's like ya I mean it's like
ah
uh I think I don't know ah I mean if like one person do on her own ah I don't really enjoy it
but if like many people that kind then it's okay ah
but for me I don't understand contemporary and urban urban lah like
I don't understand the nice to it lah hip hop that's like that's like nice ah I feel like that's nice ya
but like contemporary I don't understand personally I don't understand
I don't appreciate ya
okay so after primary school secondary school secondary school I joined ODEC
outdoor adventure club
so from there I gained a lot of experiences like I went rock climbing dragon boating
and then I joined like competitions where you know like those triathlon kind of thing where you cycle and then you run and then
then after that I got rock climbing kayaking dragon boating
oh I even joined a kayaking uh competition
and ya in
polys ah I mean organised it
but it was secondary school err but the girls managed to got third I think
and the guys I think got second so it was quite a
it's quite err like an achievement for us ah
because we didn't expect to win at all and it was just like a side thing for our
like you know it's not our kayaking it's like outdoor ya outdoor adventure club not
kayaking so it's not our forte kind of thing ya then after that err then we got
kayaking and stuff oh there was rock climbing as well
so there's like a level one cert level two cert and stuff so we got a level one and then we got like
so normally when we did
is normally with
so sometimes when do things we'll also do things ah like those like
err camps and shit and stuff is normally with eh so like ODEC also mostly was boys
so and then like sec four us as the seniors there's only three girls
and everyone was guys and considering with so everyone was guys
and there's only three girls so it was like I mean
for me I feel it was okay lah cause we managed to like I mean
the girls and I we have like those we're not very feminine also
so we're like ya so we're okay
so everything was like unproblematic but like
err secondary school I didn't really enjoy because my teachers weren't very good
teachers ah I would say ya they're they're not very good at teaching and I don't see like kindness in them also only some
but then like my form teachers and stuff like meh so I don't
ya so I didn't really enjoy secondary school and then came to poly the somehow I
got into culinary then after that
oh ya I work at Starbucks before but I so like ya I learn
I learn I learnt like latte art from there and stuff but then like surprising unfortunately
this course the coffee part is like only one part ya
so most of the thing was like in kitchen and shit which I don't really enjoy so I ended up not really enjoying this course lah
and like then ya somehow then after that like although like we did like kitchen practices and stuff but
kitchen really stressful lah the the environment the the environment very stressful and then there was like wine tasting
it's kind of it's kind of cool but meh not my cup of tea
and then somehow I
got through it so here I am now as a tuition centre admin
but I feel like I got most experiences from like my primary school or secondary school lah
poly like not really eh maybe just like smart asia but
that was fun but
nothing much for me lah ya
mm actually I did ah but I feel like my
I feel like my not good enough
mm there's no design meh
mm
mm mm
wow okay mm okay okay okay okay
I didn't know uh uh media is like so enhanced like so many things
mm mm mm mm
what's for you though what's the one that you are good in
creative director what's that
mm
oh like you the posters and stuff lah
ah
oh oh cool cool cool
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
is up to you
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm
then you should like work for like those mm shops maybe like online shops you can work as their like
like social media kind of thing what no meh
mm
mm mm
mm mm then you should open a YouTube channel
why
mm mm
ya that's true you need to like stand out and stuff
mm mm mm mm
ya I also just realised that sia
culinary was really just because of the coffee part lah really
actually ah if I'm not culinary I don't know what other course I would choose though I really cannot I really don't know eh honestly
I mean for you media media I don't see myself in media also but maybe I can do it like
I mean for me I'm someone like can adapt
right I mean that time my I design the poster also right
I don't know sia
ya I feel like I mean I'm that's why I say that can adapt to any like any places lah hor
that's what I'd say
ya true
cannot decide ah
ya I think that's what everyone's problem now ah they don't know what's their main
pro
ya you know jack of all trades
ya
mm mm
mm
mm ya
but I feel like that's what everyone says eh like err experiences over grades but then now I feel like if you have a poly student who's
like uh signing up for this job and you have a uni student but signing up for this job the uni student is always going to get it instead of the poly you know
ya can adapt better but I think they will hire the the uni one honestly
so I don't know lah so I don't when everyone says
ya
your grade not good enough
ya exactly
ya so we're caught up
so
wow
I thought it was a legit quote LOL
I think that's kind of partly true though
but one thing I'd say is like on your quote is like err capitalism like how like how celebrities do very minimal
to get like a lot of amount of money and there are people out there who are working super hard but they are still earning
like the bare bare minimum
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm ya that's true
ya
and it's sad
ya
ya life in a nutshell or what it's so sad
mm
mm
mm mm mm
ya like people cannot see you enjoy things
I mean like there's always bound to have someone who will be unhappy with your achievements
and stuff like that so ya
ya
ya huh
mm
mm mm
mm ya
mm mm mm
mm
mm
but I think that's what makes up a person ah a person will not have only good sides in him there are bound to have ugly sides in a person also
but then just some people has more ugly sides than good sides in them
mm mm
ah we just don't know what happen behind closed doors
that's true

what course
mm how long again
one year
you gonna leave me for one year girl
wow really
like legit for the rent of the house
ho four thousand
uh ah
okay what actually quite okay
a'ah
but can you in countryside I'm gonna work
probably probably
I'm thinking to asking for an upgrade to a senior so ya hmm yes
one year that's my one year yes

to think of the money as well
ya lah but see lah how
mmhmm
so it's over there but okay lah I think it's quite
okay yes

ya that thing then they can deduct so after deduction I think you can just pay like a few hundred
by the age of twenty five I want to get marry girl
and I see lah you see lah I work continue health care until I get pregnant
healthcare you if you until pregnant the benefit is good
um that's more benefit
if not then
um ya true if not
then I will see lah if my pay still the same no increment no ya not like
no increase in anything then
find new job lor either go back admin
mm

she don't travel along right no no she'd never travel
uh
so she don't have to move
whoa but then she got to study law
filing

err want it to be
I want it to have plot twist
in a good way
after twenty twenty one eh twenty twenty one ends I have then one hundred percent that I will reach
yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
yup that's nice
because the last year the whole year is me just working my ass off like everyday you know when back in two thousand nineteen I was still a student eh ya I was still a student then
err I have my student life which is very interesting
I
um I involved in so many social program clubs and all
then when it comes to twenty twenty I started to work
it comes with costs lah which is I don't have time for myself anymore and ya I I went to work at eight then
err more me time
ah I want I want to in a easy way to explain this I want to upgrade myself
that's that's my own definition of me time ah
yes like personal skills that is not is not related to my work at all
ya this is something that I really want from
from like twenty years back when I was young
I don't have money and I don't have the effort to actually to pursue that ah
I want to enroll in piano class
to be a guitarist
yes I'm still keep it I'm still want to live that ambition you know not lah not to be like professional guitarist lah no I want to be something like more elegant which is iffy I know
when I was err in primary school I actually learn how to play the keyboard ah and I did that few times I made performance in front of the school
playing keyboard
mm mmhmm
ya
ah
mm yes I think that is one of the reason kot for the shift in preference to
hmm maybe
but I still I still like to play guitar actually I feel
uh I like to listen to people playing guitar and I still have the interest but for this time
I want to play I want to learn to play piano first lah
mmhmm

um
living in a country that have chinese in it I think it will be important for me to
know how to converse with them

err and
I remember that
err I really have strong interest in language because back in
back in high school I try to enroll in as many language class as I can
err sadly only one language is err permissible for for for a student err we can only choose one additional language to learn

for things that are going to cost me myself is okay actually to procrastinate even though it's it is not good but if I I cannot prioritise that then it's okay but when it comes to something that involve others I have to
get up
and do it
like right away
