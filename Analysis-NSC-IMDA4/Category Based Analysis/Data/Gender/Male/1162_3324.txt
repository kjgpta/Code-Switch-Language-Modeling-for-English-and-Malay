so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
[oh] have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction [lah] television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
(uh) the other twin his ukrainian
(um) she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised (uh) she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress (uh) tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
(um) (uh) who is one of the clones [lah]
then she always (uh) live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming (uh) compared to season two and season four
(mm) I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones (uh) usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this [lah]
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember [lah] because this is the current show I'm watching now
(um)
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it [lah] so you won't get (err) you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil [lah] because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended (uh) without spoiling it for you
(err) I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes (uh) actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's (uh) probably safe to check out [ah] because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
foodpanda <malay>dah takde agaknya asal nak</malay>

[oh] I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's [ah] creepier and more real it's (um) it's not is not a comedy like orange orange [kan] orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent [ah] ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for (uh) (uh) why you like
[oh] (um) I mean for me (err) I'm waiting for money heist (uh) wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons [ah]
ya [ah] ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya (uh) my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show (uh) I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
[oh] ya
(mm)
ya ya
[oh] so you think you like a professional critic [ah]
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about (uh) about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident (uh) #raquel# losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real [lah] if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season (uh) but it was very entertaining to me [ah] also quite compelling and way better in spanish (um) ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
(uh) (uh) the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this (uh) money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions [ah] but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated [lah] anyway so today is twelve twelve (uh) sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full (uh) a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
(mm) I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at (uh) ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of (uh) sneakers on sale

no I'm busy (mm) I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding [ah] strider balance bike for #azam#
second
(uh) carousell so I found one (uh) (uh) that can deal at #buangkok# but (uh) he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
[oh] okay [lah] why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay [lah] firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand (uh) second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but (uh) the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly [lah]
it depends on his father's (uh) interests and free time
ya so have you thought about #azri's# suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
(uh) if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in (uh) government sector uniform group like (uh) prison service (uh) (um) I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive [eh] but you need to read more [lah] you need to do more research (uh) but there's bond [lah] I think (err) since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this (uh) uniform group then you should (uh) still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself [ah] that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
(uh) I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya (mm)
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
[oh] so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
(uh) their degree are sponsored by the company [ah] ya I mean like for example (um)
(mm)
so rolls royce pay for his degree
[oh] that's good so (uh) as he get as he [ah] got the degree right so did his salary also (uh) goes up went up
[oh] okay that's good can I ask what is his position
[oh] okay five years [eh] (mm) so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his (uh) recommendation do you don't you want to work there
[oh] okay okay
(mm) interesting rolls royce okay
[oh] so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him [lah] you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so !wah! when he joined what was his (uh) education (uh) certificate diploma so so he join (uh) it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant (uh) then he gets to stay there with his family
(mm) ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house [lah] well that's good that's good so so he so he's (uh) he told you that he signed bond for five years with (uh)
five years okay so (uh) is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree [oh] okay I think (uh) singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face [ah]
[oh] it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but [ah] but who will pay for this (uh) school the company or the company will reimburse
[oh] that's good
if you have to stay until the company
(mm) that means (err) work and study [ah] ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
[oh] really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good (um)
okay so all the best to you
