<malay>dia ada aku beli</malay> [jer] [ah]
confirm I cannot remember <malay>nya</malay>
really [ah] but actually like the whole time
<malay>korang masak</malay> like during is like not really
<malay>masakan melayu</malay> kind
so that time I tried my <malay>nenek</malay> then I just ask
what was it [ah] some <malay>sambal</malay>
can't remember I think was like <malay>ayam masak merah</malay>
then end up the only thing <malay>yang aku ingat</malay> [kan] is like there already <malay>aku masak</malay> #tom yum# <malay>nasi goreng</malay> #tom yum# [seh]
like <malay>korang korang masak</malay> is like
like <malay>ikut</malay> measurement <malay>berapa sudu</malay> all those kind of thing
then when my <malay>nenek masak</malay> then she <malay>ajar</malay> right then she just like [oh] <malay>ambil sikit ambil sikit ni ni ambil lagi banyak abeh ni lagi sikit</malay> then I <malay>macam</malay> stress [sia] I don't even remember what is <malay>sikit</malay> what is <malay>banyak</malay>
<malay>ikut rasa</malay>
that's why part <malay>ramadhan susah nak masak</malay>
so end up <malay>macam nak masak sayur pun</malay> depends on the age of the <malay>sayur</malay> that kind of hing
then you will like alter ya
Gegar Vaganza
Gegar Vaganza is the one show that all the <malay>orang tua tengok</malay>
I don't know [lah] my <malay>datuk nenek</malay> always watching [lah]
it's just singing show
but is not <malay>macam</malay> it's not <malay>macam</malay> Singapore Idol like they get new people then they is like talent is more of like already existing
artist which kind of like fell off the face of the earth
so like they get another shot of
ya like bring back the last time [lah] like #hady mirza# <malay>menang</malay> [pe] Gegar Vaganza that time
you didn't watch you should watch it
I never show you [meh] <malay>yang</malay> #hady mirza# <malay>nya</malay>
(uh) <malay>cinta luar biasa</malay>
okay later I show you then quite funny I saw <malay>dia nya</malay> starting that was his like second or third episode
then they were still talking about
like the artist what they did before this
then he was talking about his tempting #tempeh# his Grab his Grab driving
ya ya ya he sold #tempeh# for a while
he did a lot of things but it didn't like go very far
then like he was saying he went back to Gegar Vaganza <malay>pasal</malay> like
he didn't find like the things that he do like exciting to him or very fulfilling so end up he feel like maybe he was music [lah] so he went back to the thing
that's why end up before that also <malay>dia buat macam</malay>
emcee show host
like those event hosts like that
<malay>belum lagi</malay> early bro
nice
you had a part in it also you had a part in it nice
you already having trouble now [sia]
tell tell tell me when it's out
then I will wait there <malay>duduk depan</malay> then <malay>dengan</malay> phone is like <malay>mana</malay> #akid# I just press record
[ah] <malay>dia nya kakaknya</malay> wedding [ah]
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah]
why would I be inside
<malay>mana ada</malay>
no
are you sure it's not like the
<malay>abang ipar punya abang ipar</malay>
no but I never take photo
with her family
ya ya
cause <malay>dia nya</malay> cake was from my shop
wedding cake
so like (err) when on the day itself
<malay>aku ambil dia nya</malay> cake then I took Grab then I go there to her house [ah]
staff discount
<malay>kat rumah</malay>
I think initially <malay>dorang buat</malay> they were looking at hotel <malay>tu semua</malay>
then end up COVID then they just
went on with it [ah] <malay>kat rumah</malay> but okay [ah]
okay [lah] but I never actually ask how much they spend that time <malay>aku punya kawan pun kahwin</malay>
then like even lesser people came
then I think <malay>dia nya masak pun</malay> is <malay>dorang masak sendiri</malay>
<malay>dorang tak</malay> order cater <malay>tak</malay> I don't think is cater that wasn't cater <malay>pasal tak banyak orang datang</malay>
like they didn't invite a lot [lah] but then it's <malay>kat</malay> Zoom
then they like she invite <malay>kawan pun</malay> like secondary school just me and another person
then she invite like two of her poly friends <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer] then her bridesmaids [lah]
so it's like even as the bride herself <malay>dia tak</malay> invite <malay>banyak orang</malay>
okay [ah] but now <malay>banyak dorang</malay>
as in the company <malay>dorang buat</malay> is like cater <malay>hantar rumah</malay> [pe]
like the thing like that like that that time that #mariam# <malay>punya mak</malay>
