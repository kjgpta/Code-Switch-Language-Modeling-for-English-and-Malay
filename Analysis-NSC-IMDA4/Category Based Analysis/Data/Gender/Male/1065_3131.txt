(mm)
(mm) okay
(mm)
what okay
planning
okay
[oh]
okay
now it's D already disaster damage
devolution done (uh) last one is done [lah]
okay if let's say right for me [ah] if I plan [eh] sometimes it doesn't work
that way so it's very disappointing [ah] better don't plan just go you say like you will say (uh) if you plan plan plan but sometime never go to your plan because you are you are you are doing with two person you know
me and my wife if
the other side will be like (uh) [oh] no I want this one [ah] [eh] you cannot I plan already [mah] so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think [eh] want to get married it's not going to be (uh) sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later [lah] <malay>nanti dulu berbual</malay> so <malay>sekarang kita</malay> go <malay>dulu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> later part then we can plan <malay>lepas tu buat</malay> plan K (uh) getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house [mah]
so when come to the point that planning there will be a little part like we're getting a house then we see what we can afford or what you can do to our lifestyle [lah]
[ah] that is for me
so in between like what's happening you have to be have own trust [lah] each other have their own trust
so that's for me it's very simple I don't like <malay>macam</malay> you know [lah] to me a rocket go to the moon how to plan that thing no need no need no need no no no no I'm not I'm not very detail so as long as happy to see
then just go (mmhmm)
okay
[ah]

(mmhmm)
in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he no ya but I think for planning something hasty leave it up to me correct like for example when we went to get the house you shouldn't at decision that for example we want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married [ah] yes correct that that that's on my wife correct

<malay>tak dapat pergi</malay>
so
that time I thought my wife [eh] then <malay>kita baru kahwin</malay> [kan] so I thought she will get angry and shocked the whole airport can hear her voice but she relax already
