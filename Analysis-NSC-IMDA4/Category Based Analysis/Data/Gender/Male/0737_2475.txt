you know the same vibe
somehow but #rumi# is different #rumi# is
different what
it's just the <malay>pelik</malay> for me
I don't know [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
I think <malay>dia dah</malay> gonna get
engaged [eh] <malay>ke kahwin tak tahu</malay> [lah] cause <malay>dia</malay> I don't know <malay>aku selalu nampak dia</malay> on Instagram <malay>dengan</malay> this one indo girl
ya I know she's not local [lah] cause
in the video I think I got hear before <malay>dia berbual</malay> indo <malay>macam</malay> indo <malay>punya</malay> kind
so that time <malay>dia dengan</malay> dorothy together
and then <malay>dia punya</malay> Instagram is still <malay>dia dengan perempuan tu</malay>
I don't know [eh] but dorothy <malay>punya</malay> Instagram is different dorothy <malay>dengan dia</malay>
so I don't know [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
what kind of three way <malay>ke apa binatang</malay> it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird <malay>pelik</malay> also
then that time <malay>yang aku pergi tengok</malay> thai <malay>punya</malay> performance <malay>kat</malay> monti
then <malay>kita</malay> invite #rumi# also [lah] cause #rumi# <malay>cakap dia nak tengok</malay> like (um) drag performance those <malay>nya</malay> kind
and then <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> then
<malay>tertiba dia macam tak ada</malay> girlfriend
<malay>dia dia cakap dia</malay> single cause
know thai <malay>punya</malay> friends those gay friends keep asking [ah] like <malay>apa tu</malay> [oh] [ah] where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what <malay>dorang macam nak menggatal</malay> [kan] then <malay>macam</malay> like
[oh] no [lah] I'm single and some more <malay>dia tengah</malay> in <malay>ke apa</malay>
but then <malay>dia punya</malay> Instagram <malay>masih ada</malay> the indo girl <malay>tu</malay>
and then just damn <malay>pelik</malay> [ah] [sia] and he host around with anything that moves
<malay>aku pun tak tahu aku</malay> just don't know [lah]
but I know #zul# <malay>tak</malay> comfortable <malay>dengan</malay> #rumi# also
they been friends for damn long [ah] but
#zul# <malay>pun</malay> petty <malay>nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap</malay> like I don't want to talk to #rumi# cause he never wish me happy birthday
<malay>macam apa kau merepek</malay> [eh]
ya apparently then <malay>aku macam</malay>
girl <malay>kalau aku lupa nak</malay> wish <malay>kau macam mana</malay> [eh] how [ah] and was like I probably won't talk to you [ah]
I <malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak faham</malay> I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday <malay>dia macam</malay> like <malay>dia cakap</malay> birthday is important [what] it's once a year what so hard
what's so hard about (um) wishing some happy birthday
then <malay>aku cakap</malay> like if you're not
in good terms with that person why you expecting that person to wish
it doesn't make sense wouldn't you be more boiled up then
than happy
[ah] <malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah]
but #zul# know I know #zul# (um) <malay>tak</malay> comfortable cause of <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa tu namanya</malay>
(um) #rumi# I think #rumi# <malay>macam menggatal dengan dia</malay> also
(mm)
yes
unfortunately for his case [lah] but I think that time #zul# was with dylan <malay>dengan mata air dia</malay> [ah]
ya and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> like #rumi# [eh] #rumi# uncomfortable and then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I know we are all closed <malay>kita</malay> very touchy also cause we hug a lot <malay>ni semua</malay> then
<malay>dia cakap</malay> #rumi# #rumi# does that [ah] but #rumi# <malay>macam</malay>
kind of
give the weird weird vibe
(mm)
you know when it's not touchy cause you are naturally touchy but
it's <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>nak menggatal</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] [ah]
but #rumi# I've always seen as that way cause first time <malay>aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu</malay>
but first night is cool cause
<malay>kita semua minum</malay> [pe] together at sticky fingers
(ugh)
yes boss
(um) ya
but I like to see <malay>dia punya</malay> Instagram cause <malay>dia selalu pergi merayap makan</malay> and he eats good food
<malay>kat tempat</malay> the weirdest place
ya and <malay>dia ada</malay> motor I think
I think <malay>dia ada</malay> motor #vespa#
#vespa# <malay>dia macam ada</malay> shield <malay>macam</malay> that big ass shield <malay>kat depan</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> very <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> indie <malay>macam dia nak</malay> stand out from the rest
<malay>dia macam dia</malay> kind of mainstream but <malay>dia tak nak</malay> show <malay>yang dia</malay> mainstream so he gets something that is
a little mainstream but not so mainstream
<malay>macam kawan kau ni</malay> [ah] also <malay>macam</malay> motor <malay>tak banyak</malay> but actually people want that kind of bike
if it's a lot of people but
ya <malay>dia macam gitu</malay> [jer]
maybe [ah] the <malay>dorang</malay> just what one year apart [kan]
#afif# is what year
ninety nine #rumi# is ninety eight
(mm) #rumi# is #zul# age [ah]
<malay>dorang sama</malay> batch [pe] so ya

#rumi# is very people pleaser also
case <malay>dorang pakai baju</malay>

acceptable acceptable
but <malay>aku</malay> just stress [ah]

in secondary
your friend went to
west side [ah]

culinary but I don't know if it's <malay>ke tak</malay> I think he went to SHATEC or some
cooking school cause <malay>aku nampak dia selalu masak</malay> [jer]
(uh) I don't think #rumi# take <malay>aku dulu ingat dia gemuk dia pernah tunjuk gambar dia</malay>
<malay>dia tunjuk gambar dia</malay> grow up [ah] that that night at sticky fingers [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> like [eh] you all want to see or not I last time look like what <malay>gemuk gila gemuk gila macam bola</malay> [sia] <malay>muka dia</malay>

petition for <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
of course [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> standardise <malay>dia nya</malay> family

for sure <malay>kau</malay> better off in
army [lah] cause <malay>kau dulu</malay> [pe]
ya so there are a lot of relatable things just that
<malay>aku rasa</malay> mama <malay>kau</malay> die die <malay>tak nak kau masuk</malay> police [lah] or just cause <malay>dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya</malay> son go through the

technically <malay>budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada</malay> choice [pe] <malay>apa benda</malay> before enlistment you can <malay>apa tu</malay> fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause <malay>dorang cakap banyak orang</malay> depression <malay>cakap yang dorang kena campak</malay> to different organisation and then <malay>dorang</malay> suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill <malay>punya</malay> shit
