ya it's like that [lah]
(um)
okay then
why what did she say
is it really a is it really even even a break up
ya [lah] because honestly he like how to say say (uh) he says like back then like [oh] we're not together you know like we're just friends
but they act like they are together but the whole point of a relationship is the act [lah] not the just the label so basically he he was together actually because he like spend all the time with her
like they eat together then hang out together it's basically like dating [lah] even though he doesn't want to say that it's dating but the fact that it actually is what it is isn't even if he denies the the label and doesn't want to put the name on it
it is what it is you know
to what
when when was this
they will just they will just we'll we'll you and me will be third and fourth wheels [eh] no the thing is right they say they say they are not dating but they totally act like they are dating remember they do all those cringey things in front of us
!haiya! you know I don't know [lah]
like you know when when friends in like when two people in your friend group go date each other then they break up that just sucks [lah] it's like
it's just annoying I think it's just like why you all got to date each other can you just find somebody else outside your friend group
but that's what I want I think like if I want to find I'll just find someone out of my friend group cause like it's so annoying right like there's some some like friend groups will fracture because of a break up of relationship inside their friend group
shut up [lah] to shut up okay
shut up [lah]

sunday I'm supposed to supposed to go meet adela and #menaz#
I can't be bothered [lah]
no (uh) the part with adela I'm just like
(uh) you know
what do you mean
no adela wants to meet us because she just broke up
she has but I (uh) I don't know I think she wants a guy guy's opinion I don't know
what is against her
cause she's cause she's being stupid that's why
it's not it's not the fact no I feel like it's just it's not her it's not just like girls it's it's her okay
it's like
she does okay she has a lot of problems
!wow!
the [ah] I already told you [what] that time feel a bit lazy to say
no like she has such a
she has such she's such a bad unhealthy view on relationships
like she so she's so disgusting how she treats she expects a guy her boyfriend to treat her like she she like keep saying like [oh] I I want a boyfriend so that he can buy me free food
[eh] you know all these all these movement by girls like all men are trash all men are trash kill all men you know what girls are actually trash also
no [ah] you're not [lah]
that's why I don't say all girls are trash [ah] like the the the the the phrase
but you know girls are equally trash also like I when I hear adela talk about how what her what her ideal guy is like damn disgusting [sial]
like she keep saying about
(um) she keep telling telling us like [oh] I want a boyfriend so he can buy me free food like so she can buy he can buy for me (err) clothes and I can take his clothes
it's like it's so materialistic and it's so like you know like she's like using the guy to spend on her
I think she's (um)
teachers and I think she's a middle class like okay
as a student in singapore you're basically poor that's what you are but she lives in a maisonette
and her father drives audi A five I think
ya but
I but you know that's the thing like okay your parents may be rich but you are not rich you know what I mean
unless like your they constantly give you money and like
ya that's still their parents money like once you're
like once you're how to say you want to marry or something or you move out the house
like are they really going to keep giving you money
she's stable [lah]
because she has that's exactly that's what I'm saying we keep saying men are trash girls are also trash okay
exactly and then that's what girls always say no [lah] (uh) when the girl's the exception they say (uh) no [lah] she's just the exception exception like
like [eh] enough
black lives matter
no she's not
no she too dense to think about it
sometimes no [lah] she doesn't
shut up
okay she's not attitude problem but she's just very bimbo to associates
and and then it's okay when back in secondary school when you're still a very young girl
but now that you are twenty two or twenty one is become has become very
like
just grow up you know what I mean like
you're supposed to be like matured already and
think about other people and like not have this kind of views but she's the same old adela from secondary school
(uh) it's just I think it's just
mostly down to herself
because if you you can't blame your your your your ex for
behaving a certain way also [what] like the only reason why you don't develop because you don't want to
mature yourself and like grow up you know I mean
how I know tinder instagram I don't know
what else man
nowadays nowadays is all
it's slide sliding to the arms
what
ya you see #afiq# now he wishes if he he doesn't have a boyfriend (uh) girlfriend

basically what I'm saying right now is also just to fill up the
right whatever I'm saying right now is just to fill up the conversation so so sometimes I'll just say bullshit but you know it's not actually
just trying to fill up the the one hour

we are
okay then
are you kidding me

[oh] my god dude I will go with #faz# and you
and #afiq# okay forget about #amar# okay if #amar# don't want to go
why
what
but he's been working so much
this is just one time and it's not even that expensive dude
no but the the thing is if he wants to rent that that tricycle thing it's way more expensive than renting a bike you know so it makes no sense
a double bike is way more expensive than a single bike okay it's not even like because it's double bike it's two times it's not
okay you can just ride on your own so I don't think that's the case
and and also and also
also he

so what it just doesn't add up
are they all adult size
where is her bike where she live
how we supposed to bring #jurong# #jurong# west bikes all five of them to

I don't know member of parliament general election
was it I don't know I anyhow only
I don't know what's that
ya I'm not sure I'm in a group yet
mine mine when I message the person she said
(uh) I'll be added to the group
on
monday
I think
I'm not sure
maybe
but I already got my location
ya
[oh] I got my dates on eighth and and eighth of july and eleventh
ya you got what
you got nine and ten [ah]
wait isn't voting day just one day
I don't know actually
pioneer some people will vote on the ninth and tenth
so what do they do I if I setup on the eighth who's going to setup what on ninth
that's election officials that's that's not us we are doing setting up only
by because I know because my sister is
(err) election my sister-in-law is a election official
that means she'll be probably be there manning the polling booths [lah] the voting booths
ya she told me cause she she she also does the
does the she does the safety distancing ambassador thing like she goes around
like hawker centres making sure people practise safe social distancing
[eh] hello
of course [lah]
(err) no
I don't know got
if you go hawker centres they have as in like in groups of five cannot mix with another group of five okay for example
because got no safety distancing ambassadors there and everybody's an idiot
ya exactly they say groups of five go out then after that they go more than group of five groups of five they get corona then
serves them right
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] no [lah] okay [lah] no I just kidding [ah] but then like they already say [what] groups of five maximum but then they want to go break those rules
is it
I think ya the last five minutes right we try to speak malay
cause I scared got not enough malay
it's now forty nine thirty three for me what's yours
forty nine forty now
okay same
[eh] I feel really good about liverpool [ah] about man city beating liverpool
cause liverpool suck [ah]
they won already they won already
but man city beat them yesterday
no it's just a
no it's they won the the match
you understand but they didn't win the league
no okay a league how you win the league how you win the league
is that
you will
there's like thirty plus teams in the league right
so
you have your home and away matches
so basically (uh) you will fight every team at home so means your stadium and then you will go to their stadium and fight them again
so a win means three points
you your team earns three points
a draw means one point
and a lost is zero points
so basically
you have like sixty plus matches
in the league right
because it's just thirty times two [what]
so
you try to
collect the most points
(err) then the most points win [lah] win the league
so it reaches a point where hello
okay so they it liverpool reached the point in the
in the season where they
where they mathematically (uh) mathematically no other team can beat them on points
so that means they reached high enough far enough that
even if the second place team wins all the the rest of their remaining matches their points their point tally cannot go above
liverpool's
(err) point tally
so that's why they won the league
ya so they they want to win the league early [lah] so so to speak
it's it's fair [lah] as in like they were good that means they won it already that means they were they were good [lah]
ya it's fair
no how is that not fair how is that not fair
it's fair
ya
but so so liverpool already won the league
and then
(err) but you still have the remaining matches [what]
to be played
to be played
you cannot cut the league short because
even though first place has been decided second third fourth fifth sixth all the way to thirty has not been decided
[eh] wait I'm not sure how many teams there are I think is twenty four [oh] my god not thirty [ah] forget [ah] forget how many matches there are but you get what I mean
so [oh] my god wait it's not even thirty I think it's like sixteen or eighteen
can't be that many teams in a league
okay wait I think it's like
nineteen teams [ah] or some or forty or twenty teams [ah] twenty plus teams [lah] not thirty plus
so is twenty plus teams okay so
it was like so like you cannot stop the league at when the first place when the first place has been decided [what]
cause you need to find out who can come second third fourth fifth all the way to twenty plus all the way to the last right
and then the the three last teams will get relegated
they go down a league
they go to a lower division league
