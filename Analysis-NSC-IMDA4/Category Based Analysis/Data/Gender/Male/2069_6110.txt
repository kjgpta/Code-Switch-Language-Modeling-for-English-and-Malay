random fact [oh] okay
okay something not really random but
interesting that happen yesterday
(err) I booked for ten thirty class
for F forty five at #novena# shout out to F forty five #novena#
K (err) <malay>abeh lepas tu aku</malay> we attend (err) we attend the ten thirty class and then
we realise (err) like my friend <malay>pergi tanya</malay> the instructor [lah] then instructor said
the next lesson only got five people so we can join
so we joined the eleven thirty class also so
<malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>semua aku punya badan tengah</malay> ya back to back it's really very tiring
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> it's more of like
(err)
[eh] you know because it depends on days some days is different but (err) you (err) okay wait ya they let me
put it in words ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku punya</malay> word
(err) cause it's recorded
I don't know whether if this will effect F forty five in anyway but
disclaimer it's just to okay I think maybe I should but it's just like you do work out then you rest then you do workout rest workout rest <malay>macam</malay> I think it's more it's like
#tabata# but not #tabata#
but there's a lot of variation in different different
[eh] <malay>macam</malay> like there's everyday there's a lot of different variation because everyday they focus on different things
ya
ya and then different station got different exercises so you'll never do the same exercise everyday
so like yesterday I went to station four I did like a certain workout and then I went to station seven at the second lesson and then I did another set of workout which is totally different and then
ya that's why I I like really enjoy because like somemore with the environment everybody <malay>macam</malay> just doing their own <malay>apa ni</malay> doing their own workout ya and then the instructor
(err) just walk around and then <malay>dia kata</malay>
come on guys let's do it <malay>gitu aku macam tak</malay> it's it's more of like an australian accent
the pay ya
no she's not she's not she's not
ya

I don't know but but at at least quite nice but when when when I was doing it [kan] the like <malay>dia cakap</malay> come on guys let's do it or something <malay>macam</malay> like along the lines and then she's like hydrate yourself and then <malay>aku macam</malay>
okay I I'm gonna keep pushing
and then I somehow just maybe it's just in my mind [lah] <malay>macam</malay> it's a motivation
<malay>motivasi</malay>
<malay>motivasi</malay> (err) no [lah] <malay>kau tahu yang kawan aku</malay> korean tu
korean korean ya [kan] <malay>aku</malay> post <malay>gambar</malay> [ah] <malay>yang aku</malay> post <malay>gambar aku belajar</malay> not sorry
<malay>dia dulu</malay> <malay>tapi</malay>
okay cannot say anything else because it's a for him again <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>

<malay>apa</malay>
no [lah] he just he just want to go there for fun because also trial lesson is forty nine dollars [kan] so they can do for two weeks [ah] it's just <malay>macam</malay> trial so to see whether this place suits you <malay>kalau tak</malay> you have to subscribe for like one month <malay>ke</malay> per class per class for #novena# is
twenty five dollars
(err) per month which is like unlimited bookings is two hundred sixty
ya so for them for people to try out ya for people to try that why
he let like the forty nine dollars [lah] so but forty nine dollars you can use (err) train in different different places
<malay>macam mana kau</malay> [eh]
ya there is there's a lot of outlets <malay>kau tinggal kat mana</malay>

!wow!
[ah] just saying it's recorded again
okay (um)
(um) [eh] but actually you know I was thinking [kan] actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line [kan]
like you know you want to make a movie <malay>ke nak</malay> make a television show
[kan] you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
I don't know whether they're doing it for I don't know whether they are doing it for your for your monday's one [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
it's quite cool mean meaning like <malay>macam kau</malay> imagine like currently you are just having normal conversation with a random stranger then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] you just like
<malay>menyeleweng</malay> it's not is it <malay>menyeleweng</malay> no <malay>menyeleweng</malay> is like out of topic [ah] you out of topic and then some times out of topic they can use that ideas to
(err)
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if [lah] I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting [lah]
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
or <malay>macam berbual merepek</malay>
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
<malay>macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>macam apa aku tengah berbual mana tahu</malay> this the idea of me thinking of this idea can be used as an idea for the show
ya
ya okay
<malay>merepek mungkin merepek satu jam dorang dengar</malay> [eh] <malay>apa ni tak ada</malay> idea <malay>langsung</malay> <malay>tu pasal tu pasal dia kata</malay> seventy to ninety [kan] <malay>dia kasi</malay> seventy [jer] <malay>kalau bagus gitu ni</malay> idea ninety
(hmm)
(mm)
seventy <malay>sana satu orang ke bukan</malay> [kan]
[ah] yes a bit <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> monday
<malay>satu orang</malay> seventy [oh] surveyor survey
[ah]
[ah]
okay
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tak faham</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
(mm) ya [ah]
[ah] okay I
(err)
saying it to the people listening to this (err) we are currently students and if you have any (err)
part
survey offers or any voice recording or any [oh] if you are thinking of doing a podcast [eh] you can actually <malay>ambil kesempatan</malay> [eh]
[ah]
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
how from talking about how's our day to (err) <malay>sekarang</malay> we asking for job okay [lah] sorry I was cutting you short
I was cutting you so
[oh] twenty seven more minutes
[eh] that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from [eh]
just gone
ya [eh] actually ya I forgot everything you know you know <malay>yang</malay> the last time <malay>kita buat</malay>
statistics [eh]
[eh] <malay>aku bagus gila</malay> [sia] I think like I can !chey!
[ah] P <malay>abeh lepas tu ada</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> data
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
(mm) I was quite good at it <malay>tapi</malay>
[eh] pure maths <malay>aku pun</malay> okay <malay>tapi tak tahu kenapa dapat</malay> B [oh] I miss out one question
I told cause I
(err) maybe bell curve also [lah]
cause I told my teacher [eh] I I skipped one question I don't know how to do <malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] once you skip one question you confirm can not get A
<malay>agaknya gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>agaknya dorang mark</malay> [eh] !oi!
!alamak! all correct but one question wrong <malay>sekali dua</malay> question <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] <malay>dua</malay> question
two mark question is wrong and then they sorry [ah] B but <malay>babi</malay>
no [lah] but actually is is is helpful for those that
(err) don't do well [eh] wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
like <malay>macam</malay> how do I say [ah]
actually it doesn't help [hor]
you just fail
[oh] ya actually he's true [ah]
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
<malay>macam</malay> normally you are just a fifty fifty fifty out of hundred student
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this [eh]
<malay>matlamat matlamat</malay>
<malay>maklumat</malay> information [ah]
no nobody can see your forehead
okay [ah] just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
(um)
maybe five metres
overhead [eh] no overhead bridge is four point eight metres [oh] four point five [ah]
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
[oh] you want to take
class three ya (err)

[ah] I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips [ah]
<malay>boleh faham</malay> I take it there
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
our shit [oh] !oops! sorry for saying the S word <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>ke tak</malay> [eh] I took my driving <malay>kat</malay>
that place let's call it (um)
[eh] I took my (err) I would say I took as school students so not private [lah]
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
(err)
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard (err) they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
just so that my group is with all the <malay>pakcik pakcik</malay> [ah] I cannot take it like okay there's a few <malay>yang</malay> like <malay>macam muda muda</malay>
but I would say the no [lah] not my age [lah]
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
I just pick the cheapest lesson [lah] so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
<malay>dia kata</malay>
(mm) you think you are correct or not
you think
(err) you think you correct (err) you should should drive faster you should <malay>gini gitu gitu gitu tapi aku macam</malay> dude I'm just learning and then if you're not gonna teach me or tell me why I am wrong
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
<malay>nak</malay>
ya some more I I was so pissed [lah] but then
I think at that point I was just still
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't I don't argue over !aiya! just <malay>sabar</malay> patience patience
yes
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] overall but overall I would say (err) cause I the last (err) I took my like (err) test like four times
so the first two times
(err) first two times I was bad in the circuit then I failed the third time I went out <malay>tapi</malay>
(err) it was last year twenty fourth december (err) because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
(err) my test and then
(err) it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
(err)
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
can I got eighteen points but then because of that one immediate failure I fail the whole test so I <malay>merajuk sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay>
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard #sharul# ya and then I heard #sharul# ya this year then I heard #sharul# pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night

like compare to my friends that actually sign a bond like you know
this maybe this one year that they they're actually getting allowance and everything
while they are actually getting allowance and not be able to work outside I'm currently working outside gaining that experience so it's like a headstart as compared to them
