(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my wish [ah]
my wish
actually
<malay>anak-anak aku jadi anak yang baik</malay>
ya
be a good children
then
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
(mm) ya
(uh) ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
(uh) then we find it
(err)
<malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa</malay> canteen <malay>itu murah</malay> [lah]
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
(uh) actually we can sell anything [lah] but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
<malay>tak boleh jual macam ayam goreng</malay>
(uh)
<malay>ikan goreng yang goreng-goreng itu tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kita kena kurangkan minyak</malay>
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tapi masalah dia</malay>
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals [lah] to work there
ya so
(err) <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang yang nak</malay>
<malay>bagi kita itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau saya ambil alih</malay>
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
<malay>macam mana nak masak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>boleh masak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
(um)
mostly is malay food like #mee soto# #mee rebus#
#nasi lemak#
and those kind of things [lah] <malay>macam nasi putih nasi</malay>
<malay>lauk-lauk</malay>
so
(err) <malay>jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>baru saya boleh buka</malay>
(mm)
<malay>sebab</malay> because at schools they have (err)
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
so <malay>kita kena jual benda yang sama</malay>
ya
so (uh)
<malay>orang yang nak jual itu</malay>
canteen they they <malay>cakap</malay> they <malay>ada</malay>
business <malay>lain</malay> so <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ</malay> [lah] because
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them [lah]
ya
so <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> now we are
searching for the suitable space [lah] first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
(err) good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya (mm)
because
I
<malay>saya tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa itu kalau tak ada</malay>
<malay>tak ada kesihatan itu</malay>
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
<malay>duit itu kita boleh cari tapi kalau kesihatan tak ada</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
ya (mm) <malay>maksud saya yang</malay> my first wish <malay>yang anak-anak jadi baik itu</malay>
<malay>bukan baik</malay> I mean it's <malay>baik</malay> overall [lah] it's good
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>awak ada apa-apa awak boleh cakap dengan saya kalau saya boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
ya so it's best either you share everything [lah]
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
[ah]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)

extra ordinary kind I think
(err) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ingat</malay>

<malay>dekat mana</malay>
(uh)
was it good
(mm) but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
(err)
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish

person who will go and try like

so (um) <malay>sofian nak</malay>
if if you are considering higher education <malay>mana awak nak belajar</malay> singapore <malay>ke</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] they have and all masters and all [ah]
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
teaching
then
(um) but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
[eh]
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini</malay> then go
<malay>ajar budak</malay> primary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya nak</malay> like I said
<malay>nak buka</malay> business
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
<malay>kalau tak</malay> another option would be like <malay>macam</malay> work from home [lah]
like
[mah] do something like ecommerce <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay>
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
<malay>dekat sini</malay>
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
<malay>bukan tapi bukan untuk sakit yang</malay>
normal <malay>macam demam macam</malay> the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
<malay>tapi bila orang betul-betul sakit</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you know unexpected
so like like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
<malay>mahal sangat</malay>
so let's
(err) <malay>bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit</malay>
then <malay>memang orang itu dah</malay> stress because of the illness
ya so <malay>kalau dia tak ada duit</malay>
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
(um)
I wish [lah] if <malay>orang yang macam</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa tak ada tak ada tak mampu untuk merawat</malay>
so they get I think government <malay>ada juga</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi</malay> I wish they
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
ya <malay>itu</malay> maybe we can
if not that
maybe we can afford
<malay>tapi yang macam</malay> chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
<malay>lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>nanti kena</malay>
master
[oh] okay
<malay>itu satu</malay> (err) swimming <malay>sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar</malay> swimming
<malay>berenang</malay>
(err) is with is with a private coach
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat itu</malay>
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
#yio chu kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
ya <malay>sebab</malay> (err) coach <malay>itu boleh datang</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ</malay>
ya I think #yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on [lah]
I mean (uh) last time <malay>saya pernah ada juga pergi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dua tahun selepas</malay>
(err) I mean (uh) two years before two years ago
<malay>tapi</malay> coach <malay>itu walaupun</malay> <malay>dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh</malay> lessons
<malay>tapi</malay> the coach is like (uh) not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own (mm) but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven <malay>tapi</malay> each lesson <malay>itu</malay>
it's very
meaning I mean very (err)
<malay>ada dia punya itu</malay> [lah] result
so (um) <malay>berenang itu</malay>
(uh) so I I I I think I need (err) more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
<malay>lagi satu itu saya</malay>
because <malay>sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima</malay>
so <malay>sekarang</malay>
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates

(err) because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
no bread toast is just I like [lah] but not (mm) not I eat something that I eat rest of my life <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay>
(um)
I would rather go for something with proteins
like <malay>macam</malay>

from
ya with some fruits and veggies
<malay>kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa</malay> [eh]

<malay>bawah itu yang dah rangup</malay>
<malay>nasi yang dah</malay>

(hmm)
ya <malay>tak tak tapi</malay>
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best (um) #mandi# rice I cooked so far

than the previous one
(mm)

(mm)
pizza <malay>dekat mana</malay>
pizza hut
!hey! which pizza you ate [ah]
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(err) tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and #ghee# rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
(err) you need a little bit of <malay>minyak sapi</malay>
(err) depends [lah] if you want to put it all <malay>minyak sapi</malay> or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice
any cups [lah]
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion you should you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
(err) translucent like a bit brown then you put
you <malay>boleh</malay> you <malay>boleh letak rempah-rempah dia</malay> like <malay>kayu manis buah pelaga</malay> is
(err) what is the name in english (uh)
<malay>bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak</malay> [lah] because it's only one cup of rice
so just one one will do one small piece of
<malay>kayu manis</malay>
<malay>buah pelaga satu cukup</malay>
then <malay>cengkih</malay> is clove
then
ya that's all [lah] if you have
<malay>macam daun salam</malay> is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
then you [dah] fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
(err) you <malay>letak garam</malay>
(err) according to your taste [lah]
<malay>garam</malay> then when it when the
water starts to boil you <malay>letak itu beras</malay>
then you cook [lah] rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version [lah] there's many kind of
(err) <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you are talking about <malay>nasi minyak</malay> right
(uh) <malay>nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
<malay>ada letak</malay>
instead of (uh) instead of
all water they will mix with half half like <malay>susu cair</malay>
half <malay>susu cair</malay> half water
so what's that one and a half cup right
no <malay>nasi lemak kita letak santan</malay>
this is <malay>nasi minyak</malay>
ya <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit [lah]
(mm) then you <malay>boleh letak daun pandan daun serai</malay>
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>boleh letak</malay> tomato
(uh)
you (uh) <malay>boleh letak</malay> chilli <malay>hijau semua</malay> [lah] then you put half half [lah] <malay>separuh</malay>
<malay>separuh susu cair</malay>
<malay>jadi tiga suku tiga suku</malay>
(uh) then the same method you put the (uh) <malay>garam</malay>
then you put the rice
the other one the taste will be <malay>macam kenduri punya nasi lemak</malay> [lah]
[ah]
ya
ya that one is more like (uh) is (uh) more with it goes well with like <malay>macam ayam masak merah rendang semua</malay>
ya <malay>ini nasi minyak</malay> simple <malay>punya</malay> so it goes well with (uh) curry chicken
ya curry chicken [lah] the best with potatoes
(mm)
can
no [oh] it's it's
it's easy to make
you then you can try to make tomorrow
I already to
it's not that difficult you just need one
[ah] onion that's all then the rest
ya you can use the rice cooker
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can <malay>kau boleh masak dekat sekolah</malay>
<malay>boleh tak</malay>
you <malay>punya sekolah itu boleh pakai</malay>
you you <malay>boleh bawa itu</malay> (uh)
the
pot [lah] the there is a pot call multi
(err) what is the name of the pot (uh) you can cook everything in that pot
is like it acts like <malay>macam bila</malay> you <malay>nak masak</malay> soup with I mean like maggi
<malay>boleh nasi boleh lauk pun boleh</malay> you only need that one pot which call magic pot I don't know
