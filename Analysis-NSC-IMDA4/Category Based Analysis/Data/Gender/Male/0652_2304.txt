right
#ayip#
pick me up after work
I you know like like the good boyfriend
he he he
ya
<malay>kita gi makan</malay>
and all that
then on the way back (err) I I don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then I was talking about
[oh] down to V E
you know
ya cause I think we were
[oh] it's one of those kind I like like like (um) on the video <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
they would [ah] play <malay>macam</malay>
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what I'm what
no I'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if I were the I will get a kick out I think the most stupid things [ah]
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then I'll
sorry I just thought of of of him
[ah] then we were I was talking about it till like
ya ya then I was talking about it too
how to
tired [ah]
then he was
eighty nine
I wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
[ah] us ya
so (um) then he was saying how (um)
how did they go into it I
okay so <malay>dia cakap macam</malay>
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then I was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
(err)
<malay>kalau aku</malay> #hilmi#
[kan]
I would
I wouldn't support all these things
ya
so I was I was saying that I don't think #hilmi# actually supports [ah] no of course not
then [ah] he #wafan# was saying ya but you know the act of <malay>macam</malay> more or less you're saying
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do [lah]
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up [ah]
then he was saying how (um)
I think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
I was wondering <malay>kalau</malay>
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that [ah]
so now what now is just
<malay>matair</malay> [jer]
!huh! !huh!
so that's the thing I was trying to get across to him [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know I understand where he's coming from <malay>sebab</malay>
it's
it doesn't feel
great [ah]
help help that's a fucking understatement [kan] ya but <malay>macam</malay>
I was telling him [ah] like they are gonna
in a in a very tough spot <malay>aku macam</malay> put it in a more personal light [ah] I'm saying that I totally not okay
[ah] when
when I had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then I was saying him [eh] I but mine wasn't cause of cheating [ah] of course
so
like if I was the cheater
like would you still hang out with me <malay>tak</malay>
in that sense
and then <malay>macam cakap</malay>
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit [tau]
ya
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then <malay>dia macam maki sekejap</malay> [ah]
like normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
[eh]
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for
right
that guy still wouldn't let me play music on his car okay
no
no the idea I was just saying okay
!hey! brother
you should remind me to bring an cable then I can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
<malay>asal kau nak gini</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak tak tak</malay>
it it
singapore is very small
<malay>kau nak main lagu apa</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> he said that he said that ultimate like <malay>pakcik</malay> thing to say that [ah] that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this [one] <malay>pakcik</malay> thing but he said the other part <malay>pakcik</malay> thing
<malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>nanti aku tak boleh</malay> focus
[oh] !wow!
!wow! that's that's going into the wrong direction [ah]
so anyways right
ya so (um) about that I think then he was
telling me that
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay I I would still hang out with you <malay>aku masih boleh</malay>
<malay>lepak dengan kau</malay> [ah] kind of thing
but
I don't want to have the girl there like I cannot
<malay>aku macam</malay> okay
fair enough [ah]
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch [ah]
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
let's say <malay>kau nak main macam</malay> devil's advocate kind of thing
like how do you defend
[ah] his his actions from a moral standpoint [ah]
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than I am [lah] [kan]
so what do you feel about the difference <malay>macam</malay> in terms of
(uh) being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
okay but what do you think of her <malay>macam dia punya</malay> character and such
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given [ah]
(mm)
I don't know that's a very controversial statement [ah]
so by those dates
you you describe it as (um)
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
okay so I what I don't see where you're coming from [ah] <malay>macam aku faham</malay> but I don't think it's matter of gender [tau]
to me that [one] it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender [lah] like that's true
right
okay
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
#fahim# isn't exactly mister olympia material himself [pe]
I mean
what
I mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight I I've always known her to be a bit of
on the (err)
how do I put this
okay
rounder side of life [ah]
at !wah! that's
brother why you got to use the F word
what it post
!wah! I cannot
[sial] [ah]
<malay>bodoh gila</malay> [pe]
brunei
[eh] no no no no no
I've been to brunei
okay so
[ah] people in brunei
no I'm not talking about like the
workers are like the they have a lot of like foreign workers
<malay>sama sama</malay> situation as us [ah]
no but they are middle
income people there
right
half of them are
bulgy chonkers <malay>juga</malay> [tau]
ya
so like (uh) I was asking bell [lah] that time it's like why [ah]
like
when we do say you know
a couple of
chonkers due here in
singapore
[ha] [ha]
but
do you see more that there
then she was saying [oh] then she was expecting okay (um) one thing is
<malay>dia punya</malay> their food
[kan] <malay>dorang punya makanan</malay>
[ah] it's
the portion [kan] <malay>besar gila</malay>
that's A
B
(err) a public transport is a fucking nightmare
everyone drives
<malay>tapi</malay> there's no incentive too you know
<malay>buat apa</malay>
but there's no tourism to speak of
but that [one] also doesn't paint like (err) <malay>macam</malay> compete picture <malay>juga</malay> cause a lot of the citizens <malay>dorang punya</malay> baseline is met
free education free healthcare
right
I mean
okay (uh) as a brown guy here <malay>aku pun</malay> free education [ah] up to a point
but healthcare is not free [what]
ya
[oh] ya
we get sidetrack <malay>macam anjing</malay>
so basically I was
I was talking about [ah] about #ruqayyah# and then we talking about ya okay so
your your whole day your
I think what you're trying to say in summary is that
<malay>dia macam</malay>
a bit spoilt
like
and she doesn't have that drive in her to
do more
like
(uh huh)
wait so there are
other factors <malay>juga</malay>
december anything
yes
yes
okay so what is it about the
(err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
no no no no no
[ah]
so what is it about the home wrecker <malay>yang</malay>
you know
[eh]
!wow!
why does it sound (mm)
(mmhmm)
like it just physical
[oh] man
<malay>tak aku</malay>
<malay>punya</malay> urge to choke slam <malay>dia</malay> is like rising [ah] it's
!wow!
but
I don't
the thing is right
I don't think right
having someone else was seeking comfort in someone else would solve anything
like the underlying issue is still there <malay>apa</malay> like he's basically not happy
<malay>tapi dia tahu tak</malay>
<malay>kenapa dia tak happy</malay>
how else you gonna get and loot
you know
I don't know but then now it's all it's all over messy as hell
it's a <malay>dengki</malay> thing [ah]
it's a revenge thing [ah]
maybe
very complicated stuff
you know like I know we've known the guy for like forever
I never thought
(mmhmm)
now is what
fourteen years
no I never
don't want to say that but you said but you said it
ya I never thought you with #tino# until but then again all of us
ya but somehow in in in your mind you always thinking you know okay (uh) marriage is like the big leveller [ah]
it would down
calm down his raging lions that kind of thing
do you even iron clothes
[oh] I haven't seen an iron board in years [ah] dude
what for
but if you see me tons of time <malay>aku mana</malay> iron anything
ya
(mm)
so anyways
I don't remember that
[ha] [ha]
!wow!
no but it's one of those things that it just <malay>macam</malay> it creeps up on you
like like no one just wakes up one day twenty kilo heavier [pe]
don't care what you eat but the [oh] how many times you eat [lah] in that sense
wait
what's
what's your weight now [ah]
!wow!
[eh] is it
I I don't
is it
is it normal for your height I I don't actually know
right so if you
it's like you're on the the yellow zone kind of thing [ah] is it
[oh] no there's a difference you know you you you you cannot use the [ah] #ang moh# ones
ya ya ya result
<malay>sebab</malay> [ah] asian <malay>dengan</malay>
white guys different [ah]
in terms of what lean body mass
ya
I mean we just evolved from different monkeys [lah] I guess
[ah] I don't think there's a big difference between malay and chinese
you know
[ah] wait wait wait wait
[eh] wait wait
what were they talking about [ah]
that [one]
okay okay
wait wait [ah] <malay>kau</malay> sixty one right
okay how how how tall are you
one six seven let me
[eh] brother you are at low risk good job
[ah] ya your is twenty one point nine
[orh] without what is mine hold on
but the
but this one thing isn't accurate also cause the [one] doesn't ask for your gender which makes a difference [ah]
according to this my is twenty three point six
moderate risk
ya but I used to but I think (um) I think a couple of months ago I was
I was I was a bit of a
in a chonky
kind of situation <malay>aku macam</malay> I was eighty six kilo [sia]
I think my my highest
my my my my peak [ah]
peak
no
my peak was I was nine
you know at my peak I was ninety kilos [jer]
right
I
I think I know which [one] you're talking about like the picture
sugar a is an addiction
<malay>aku</malay> used to have an issue about eating [ah] I don't why like I I was constantly <malay>lapar</malay> like hungry
<malay>macam lapar gila</malay>
but you eat you wake up in the morning <malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
ravenous <malay>nak mampus</malay>
!huh! !huh! !huh!
and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
(mm)
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
I don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it [ah]
ya
alright
in law no not yet so [ah] cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
[ah] german guy did I did I told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course [ah] and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so (um) it's like things to do if the if (uh) for you know respiratory things [ah]
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing (uh) this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time [ah] he was telling me this I wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit #siao# also
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I think they were doing like is
[ah] quarterly report or something [lah]
<malay>pasal dorang punya</malay>
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message [ah]
saying that you know
(um) good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email [ah]
then then at then a while ago were like complaining [ah] how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
COVID
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
I don't know german guy
[ah] then
he will he told me he told me that first [ah] that was like the first time I met him then when when I met him again he was telling me the same story that I thought okay [ah] this old man might might have been repeating his story again
<malay>macam</malay> no no no
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two [ah]
or a few months medical leave
then then I was like [oh] why
I wasn't thinking that
at at first I was thinking like something else [lah] right
then said no
he got COVID
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> yo
what the fuck
is it <malay>dah macam</malay> you know like
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
(um) the initial thing was
they wanted to get married [ah] this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents [lah] of course
no it's not so much #muz# [ah] #muz# <malay>macam</malay>
it's usually like a like a mother thing [lah] like
ya this kind of
ya so (um) and then what you call it [ah] then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that (uh) he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
so he was first I said okay but it was that kind of okay <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>suka hati</malay> [ah] you know that kind of thing
[ah] kind of ya so my sister was complaining a bit and then after that he was finding a a lot of issues <malay>pasal</malay>
islam [ah]
in general
like
which you know
can I can totally
ya if you talk to me about it !woo! you can go on for like this [ah] but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it [lah] then I'm like
<malay>aku pun nak</malay> join his side but I cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know I've I've (um) contemplated about [lah] some of them <malay>macam</malay> not a big deal but there are some things that he that as I find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is <malay>zakat</malay>
<malay>dia macam cakap</malay> [oh] it doesn't feel transparent
yes
then I'm like
ya that's what I told my sister also [lah] I haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to then I I told my dad I told my sister you know
I never give I just donate
on my own
what I didn't mention was I donate to myself so it's a different thing
[eh] you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy [what]
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway I
<malay>betul</malay> [ah] that's what #fahim# adhere
so
ya so anyway then (um)
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
#wuhan# flu and all that
[ah] chinese cough as they say
and then (err)
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and (um)
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow [ah] from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved [ah] which is fair
ya [lah] of course [lah] you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay [ah] mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up [ah]
then (uh)
so my mum
I thought I thought they were in a good spot
[ah] and they were kind of
having some progress [ah] but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause (uh) [kan] they both work from home
like
(uh) my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go I think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya I wish I could do that
(um)
ya then [ah] he goes over to his place a lot cause (uh) K so my my parents live in #bedok# south right which is
basically near #tanah merah# right
then he lives at the condo at #tanah merah#
ya I think that's what it's called ya I've been there before once [pe]
ya
so she goes over there like every other day [ah] to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
[ah] okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya [sia] ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it [lah]
one of those guys
ya
and then [ah] she's there like every other day then (um) that day I kind of went to meet my mum
no not my family dinner at <malay>simpang</malay> [kan]
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of [eh] why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about (uh) that issue like my sister
(um) being over there [lah] what
and saying how [oh]
<malay>sebagai orang islam</malay>
[ah] <malay>aku dah</malay>
my mum
then
<malay>aku dengar tu aku dah macam</malay> (oo)
<malay>bulu</malay>
<malay>roma dah</malay> stand at attention
so I <malay>kau jangan cakap gini</malay> [ah]
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do [ah]
I don't know then I I told her that I think the best thing to do is
<malay>macam</malay> you cannot expect a marriage now [what] doesn't make sense right
so the best thing to do
ya [lah] exactly then I told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
just the show <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
I think they should know
then the last time [ah] he talked to me and (uh) he brought me out for beers
[oh] he <malay>ajak</malay> me again like today's friday but <malay>aku macam</malay>
[ah] I've got things to do [ah]
ya so I didn't
what
[oh] no no <malay>aku</malay> have
an online class that that I want to do
ya
no no no no as in I am I am I am doing like a psychology course [lah] so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones [lah] it's just to like you know
no it's one of those like coursera kind of shit <malay>kau tahu</malay>
[ah] ya
so anyway (um) what what I saying ya then he was telling me about
[ah] at first if his parents have some reservations [ah] about him
going out with a malay asian girl [ah]
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
I get it
fair enough
no [ah] [ah] !whoa! this just !whoa! !whoa! that's fucked up
that's true
then at first I was kind of offended and then I had then I really thought about it for like for like a bit then I realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like [ah] muslim countries [lah] right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
this makes sense <malay>aku aku faham</malay>
but I don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way [tau]
was it (mm)
australia [eh] <malay>tak</malay>
ya so I think in the end just closed like that you know I think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first [lah]
