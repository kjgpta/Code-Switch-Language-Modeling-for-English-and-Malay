it's more apt
#tanjong pagar# theme <malay>apa</malay>

to choose for the
gift exchange
I don't know I don't know <malay>dia dah</malay> decide <malay>ke belum</malay> but I think that time <malay>dia ada cakap</malay> R

I think it was R
(err)
prime [ah] prime
<malay>kat</malay> #sembawang# <malay>ada</malay> too bad <malay>kat</malay> #sembawang# <malay>ada</malay>

vegan
okay can
wait when when is the dinner

we can dinner on twenty eight or twenty nine
at buffet town
<malay>nanti</malay> edward complain <malay>lagi cakap</malay> should have change [lah] should have change [lah]
hopefully
could be
okay
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel [jer] but date is settled [lah] and I think <malay>makan pun</malay> is
[eh] but you said at west
[oh]
we going two days one night [ah]
[oh]
wait twenty eight is (err)
monday sunday sunday [lah] I think it's sunday [lah] sunday monday cause every setup he got one weekend he needs to clear
ya
no I think it's sunday monday
[eh] maybe monday tuesday
[oh] rates
then he say it's like seven hundred online
the I was only four hundred
but how come it's just that date difference [ah]
[oh]
lame
speaking of travel
of course [lah] I mean it's so nice the weather is cold
<malay>kat sini pun dekat</malay> [kan]
hotel <malay>punya</malay> room [jer] [lah]
no
okay
but when you went that time it's not the cold season kind of is it summer !hais! that was
global warming
too bad
okay [lah] but at least you went out so still okay
okay [lah]
then like that
(hmm) more or less it's
sort of confirm the staycation
the when do you think we can travel back again
[oh] ya
where where's the tunnel
no they say that (um) what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
(mm)
!huh!
<malay>tak cukup ke</malay>
I thought they are going to prioritise <malay>yang</malay> the elderly or like
[ah]
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay [lah] probably
it's gonna be better
!huh! but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young [lah]
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest [lah] is like
don't know <malay>kalau dekat sana</malay> like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
[ah] I was looking at this youtube (um)
the youtube is from america [lah]
then like it's (err) <malay>pasal</malay> plants
yes
so it's like (um)
she
went to a nursery with
<malay>dia punya mak</malay>
like plant nursery with <malay>dia punya mak</malay>
then (um) the funny thing was <malay>dia seorang</malay> [jer] <malay>yang pakai</malay> mask
<malay>mak dia tak pakai</malay> mask
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear [lah] I don't know [lah] it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
<malay>mak dia tak pakai</malay> mask so it's like !huh!
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
and ya [lah] <malay>dia orang punya rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>selalu</malay> mansion mansion <malay>berapa</malay> storey <malay>semua</malay> [kan] so they can afford the space but it's already like
there's a lot of different plants that (um) she feature [lah]
and then (err) the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya <malay>dekat</malay> desert <malay>punya bukan</malay>
no no is not succulent it's like probably <malay>macam</malay> the height
no it's like <malay>macam</malay> the height of the snake plant [ah]
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent [what] no [meh]
no it's like
[ah] it's like a
(um)
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not <malay>bukan macam kau punya</malay> this thing
ya it's like (um) apparently when the leaves are young
like
it's quite bendy but then <malay>bila dia dah tua</malay> like it's quite stiff kind
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though [ah]
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
<malay>yang dia beli tu</malay> is quite an old one so it's quite tall
ya it's quite tall
<malay>pokok</malay> mango
yes
(mmhmm)
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
<malay>ada banyak</malay> problem than benefit
cause I think it's like (um) you see
in a
especially like a globalized world right now <malay>macam kalau</malay> you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of disruptions
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
<malay>bukan</malay> natural way [lah] like like the business way the business way is that <malay>macam kena</malay> halt and and
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think (um)
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because <malay>macam</malay> like
you think about it all the businesses <malay>dia orang punya</malay> momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then <malay>kena</malay> halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of (err) during business [ah] so it's too soon to adapt
(um) and there's no leeway [lah]
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the period but I think
for the personal lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
cause <malay>macam</malay> like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area [lah] but myself like #ang mo kio# this kind of area my <malay>banyak orang-orang tua</malay> live right then like you see those <malay>apek-apek duduk bawah</malay> block <malay>baca surat khabar</malay> that kind just like just <malay>duduk bawah</malay> block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is <malay>macam</malay>
it like I think
I don't know but I feel [lah] <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay>
normal way of living <malay>pun kena</malay> change forcefully change so in that sense you especially <malay>bila dia orang dah</malay> like this kind of age
it's not so healthy because
one thing is that <malay>dia orang pun</malay> could probably be living alone and this is their only form of <malay>macam</malay> keeping sane and (err) you know socialise that kind of thing like
in their own way of keeping healthy [lah] so I think in that sense (err) that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
businesses wise I think (um) I think between businesses and societal <malay>macam</malay> thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think <malay>kalau macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you are just #suay# [lah] then you just <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>baru</malay> then <malay>kena</malay> lockdown then <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] too bad for you [lah] but businesses wise like you said it can be a
(err) just a method [oh] [oh] a matter of adaptation and how quick you are [lah] but then also <malay>macam</malay> those traditional businesses <malay>pun macam</malay> losing out also because
they are traditional [lah] like <malay>kat kedai kopi ni semua</malay>
<malay>cik limah punya mee rebus</malay>
they actually force them to actually
(mm)
(mm)
okay [lah] I mean on the other hand <malay>pun macam</malay> you need to also see like <malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu</malay>
[ah]
but I think about limitation [leh] <malay>macam</malay> like for example the reason why maybe <malay>cik limah tak pergi</malay> digital is is maybe because <malay>dia punya</malay> (um) expertise is not there then <malay>kalau</malay> she go digital <malay>pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai</malay> to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help <malay>dekat</malay> the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya [lah] but then like on her side <malay>pun macam</malay> it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
okay is okay [lah] but I think before
enforcing or like really okay [lah] enforcing <malay>macam</malay> a bit tough [lah] but like (um) pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(err)
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
(mm)
(mm)
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those (um)
underprivileged families where you are staying <malay>macam</malay> like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
(um) minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of (err) amenities for them to study which are like the laptop [lah] the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
there was also this <malay>macam</malay> article I think <malay>dekat dekat mana</malay> [eh]
the straits times or something like that <malay>yang</malay> this (um)
girl in
[ah] [ah]
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her [lah] but for like elders other younger kids [leh] then how
ya
(mm)
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
the and all these case [lah] basically <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay> wifi <malay>bukannya</malay> strong [kan] like you know you have a lot to handle
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
<malay>aku tengok kat luar tingkap</malay> [jer]
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today [lah] I think there were also reports plus (err) like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
(um)
thought of
like
okay [lah] the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
foreign worker <malay>punya</malay> dorm [kan] ya
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans [what] just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans [what] so it should be
(um)
encompass in all this care [lah]
but I think like
maybe I don't know like <malay>dia orang</malay> should probably lockdown in stages <malay>agaknya</malay> (um)
(mm)
(mm)
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the <malay>orang-orang tua</malay> who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
ya
ya even (um)
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
I mean <malay>orang tua</malay> like they probably don't have
iphone ten
it's probably just a land line <malay>dekat rumah yang</malay> ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
but more physically [lah] so
(err) that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
(mm)
no [lah] I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of [lah] I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
[oh] is it
[oh]
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on [lah]
cause I think <malay>dekat</malay> news <malay>pun ada cakap pasal</malay> the number of domestic abusers
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay [lah] I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite <malay>lepak</malay>
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
!aiyo! but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
!hais!
don't know what's gonna happen and
problem okay what do we talk about <malay>pasal</malay> societal business (err)
(mm)
I think
how can nature be a problem
no ya <malay>bukannya</malay> tracks <malay>semua ada pokok</malay>
that's
but aedes is because of <malay>air bertakung</malay> right
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay [lor] if you say so [lor]
[ah]
unless [lah] got one <malay>pokok pisang dekat</malay> in the middle of the north south line from #yew tee# to #kranji#
then there is a big issue [lah]
but I think like
<malay>ke</malay> wild boar <malay>dekat dekat</malay> #sembawang#
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
<malay>dia orang</malay> enforce the rule people will really follow <malay>apa</malay> it's like you have all those (mm) (mm)
but
ya [lah] but I still think [lah] confirm under black market so it's not that much [lah]
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything [one]
really [what]
(mm)
ya [lah] but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom [what]
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already [what]
<malay>kau bunuh</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa benda kau bunuh</malay> lion <malay>tu</malay>
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that [what] they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no [lah] I think
then animal go home [lor]
take the bus [lor]
no [lah] I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
were these animals obtain [kan] and so <malay>kalau macam</malay> they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
<malay>merepek</malay> [ah]
buy one get one free
I think they kill it [leh]
remember there was this report <malay>pasal</malay> mink farm <malay>dekat mana entah</malay>
[ah]
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also [what] and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
that animals roasted already [lah] <malay>pantang</malay> #liao#
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not <malay>dia punya</malay>
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
[ah]
you have seen it before [what]
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
wait [lah] <malay>nanti dia dah besar dah</malay> [lah] <malay>letak balik kat dalam</malay>
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
<malay>hari-hari dia berdoa</malay>
should google it up the prayer plant
and (err) it's an indoor plant
(err)
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay [lah]
technically not really [eh] it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
(um)
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
[ah] [ah]
so technically <malay>dia orang punya</malay> care is quite princess [lah] they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
<malay>macam gitu kalau kau buat bodoh pun dia macam gitu</malay>
really [meh] I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it (err) refreshes the air [ah] NASA say [one]
really
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
true [lah]
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
!huh!
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves <malay>gulung</malay> like that then they will
this thing doesn't <malay>gulung</malay> [what]
shoots [ah] shoots
[oh]
okay [lah] but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
<malay>dia jadi</malay> go
<malay>dia jadi</malay> brown
I didn't know then no I never no [lah] <malay>tak jadi</malay>
<malay>jahat nah aku</malay>
okay wait [ah]
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
ya like it cannot get cold seem like <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>setakat satu malam</malay> [jer]
that is true [hor]
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong (um) so
what sort of plant got [meh]
coconut tree but it's not
<malay>daun</malay>
<malay>kau pergi jemputan mana</malay>
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
<malay>apa</malay> is standard <malay>pokok</malay>
[oh] my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
ya <malay>bodoh</malay>
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
ya so it's a very sturdy plant <malay>dia punya</malay> leaf <malay>macam</malay> like those kind of <malay>pokok pisang punya</malay> leaves but it's (err)
a bit different [lah] the milkshake
of course right cause you are not <malay>pokok pisang</malay>
ya but anyway it's quite (um) it's quite a journey
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully <malay>dia tak mati</malay>
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them (um) water the plant
they never like <malay>pakai</malay> those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the #dabao# there from container <malay>dia</malay> just scoop <malay>air gitu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay>
like it they pouring into the side [lah] not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like !wow! like that [ah]
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk [what]
<malay>sesungguhnya</malay>
scotch tap [hor] it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
pail of water and pour the plant [mah] <malay>dia pakai</malay> watering can [jer]
so I was quite amazed like [oh] okay you can actually do that
ya I mean they will say [lah] like <malay>macam kalau</malay> the top all the dry then you can water that kind [lah] <malay>bukannya hari-hari dia</malay> water the plant
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care [lah]
once it's the one at home the
the fenestrations fenestrations
ya then maybe I can buy that
but then I don't know where to put
my room is quite small
<malay>jangan beli yang menyemak punya</malay>
no one [lah] not the standard issue plan [lah] and then like that one at
what is that
I don't understand
(hmm)
