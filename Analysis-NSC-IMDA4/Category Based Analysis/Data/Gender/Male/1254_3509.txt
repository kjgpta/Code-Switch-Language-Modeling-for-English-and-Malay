(err) <malay>orang yang orang yang apa itu membersihkan</malay>
(mm) <malay>dan</malay> <malay>dan apa itu</malay>
<malay>menggunakan</malay> (uh) vacuum special
I think <malay>beliau bercakap</malay>
<malay>dia cakap memang kotor</malay> [ah] <malay>macam minyak itunya bila dah bersih</malay>
[kan] <malay>air dia</malay> [kan] <malay>warna warna coklat</malay>

<malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> order <malay>menerusi ruangan yang ruangan lubang itu</malay> [lah]
[ah]
<malay>nanti kalau</malay> I <malay>nak letak loceng</malay>
<malay>jadi bila</malay> I <malay>nak panggil</malay> you <malay>sayang</malay>
I <malay>picit loceng yang itu</malay>
no [lah] you not my waiter <malay>tapi</malay>
you are my (uh) private
cook
ya (uh) I will buy all the ingredient
and then (uh) I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter (um)
you want a you want to put like a (uh) you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
(uh) the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because [ah] ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better [lah] because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and (uh) moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food [lah]
ya
and then
ya
so you <malay>hari itu</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>kita kena tengok</malay>
(uh) <malay>harga</malay> quotation <malay>itu berapa</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> within budget I think we can
I don't know whether want to do a partial hack <malay>ke</malay> or
or total hack <malay>ke</malay>
so <malay>itu kita kena tanya</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kita punya</malay> [lah] what will be the quotation
you <malay>cakap</malay> you <malay>nak nak nak</malay> hack certain areas
<malay>dekat</malay> the platform
to to (uh) depends on (uh)
whether it's whether <malay>kalau</malay> within <malay>kita punya</malay> budget [ah]
ya (uh) ya platform <malay>itu pun dah</malay>
<malay>dah macam teruk sangat</malay>
so <malay>kena tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kita nak</malay> hack and then <malay>nak pasang</malay> a new
<malay>baru punya</malay> platform
[ah] <malay>berapa</malay> <malay>akan</malay> quote <malay>kita</malay>
(mm)

[ah] so <malay>kena</malay>
<malay>kalau kalau tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>tengok</malay> budget <malay>kalau macam</malay> #terover#
maybe just hack and just <malay>letak</malay> vinyl
[kan] [ah]
<malay>letak</malay> vinyl

(mm) ya I I think you you think that concept
(err) I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack (uh) (uh) the what you call that the the wall there
(err)
and then you (uh) you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
[oh] <malay>dekat</malay> (uh)
(uh) <malay>dia ambil dari</malay> <malay>mana</malay>

you think because (uh) Facebook and have been
spying spying on your on your your search

very nice <malay>cantik</malay>
you can consider <malay>tapi tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>harga dia berapa</malay>
(mm)
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
(uh) multiple attempt to
(uh) kill them
they (uh) they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
(uh) it (uh) spraying the the lizard repellents (uh) spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too [lah] the our our house here I think
(uh) the it's there's a lot of (uh) lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient [ah] even though I've tried to to to hit them [ah] is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
[oh] my god so (uh) I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
[ah]
is what <malay>kita kita mungkin dah dah bela dari kecil</malay>
<malay>sampai dia membesar membesar lama jadi dia dah dah dah dah sebati</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan rumah kita macam</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia pandai</malay> [tau] <malay>dia kalau kalau kita ada dia dia tak keluar tapi kalau kita macam tengah tidur atau apa dia senyap-senyap sebab</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang nampak macam tahi cicak</malay> (err)

<malay>jadi memang setiap kali itu kena macam mana kena cuci kena sental dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> (err) <malay>apa itu</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> spray spray <malay>pencuci lantai semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>memang kadang-kadang tu kadang-kadang lepas kerja tu memang kadang memang memang nak memang nak bersihkan</malay>
<malay>tahi-tahi itu tapi kadang-kadang kita pun</malay>
(err) <malay>letih balik kerja satu hari itu kerja kita penat jadi</malay>
<malay>kita kadang-kadang kita tangguh</malay>
<malay>kita tangguh</malay>
time <malay>kita kalau kita tangguh tangguh tangguh sampai</malay>
<malay>berhari-hari sampai berminggu-minggu sampai kadang-kadang</malay> is (err) <malay>isteri</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>isteri kalau</malay>
(uh) <malay>itu dia akan</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] <malay>faham-faham</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau kita tak tak tak buat itu faham-faham</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti apa isteri akan buat</malay> [kan]
(err)
ya
ya
<malay>memang</malay> (uh) ya [lah] I understand [lah] your your your fear your your concerns so that's that's why we are having this you know
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time [lah] it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners (uh) I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity [lah] it's a it's a need [lah] more of a need
necessity because everything has (err) you know
wears down you know
and (uh) our our kitchen looks quite dirty and (uh) rundown and (uh)
our our the (uh) you call it the flooring starts to (uh) wears down
[ah] ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and (uh) they feature a few (uh) [lah] but (uh) so far three D contractors (uh) in terms of
the the the outcome [ah] it it it suits our taste [ah]
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
[eh] very nice [lah] we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but (uh) ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that (uh)
the kitchen the kitchen <malay>apa itu</malay>
not not not the sink [ah] kitchen tap
quite a few [lah] and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus [oh] one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
who halfway (uh) <malay>merajuk</malay> and don't want to come
to finish off the [ah]
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
!aiya!
ya [lah] <malay>dia dia ini</malay>
I don't know [lah] it's both it is both (uh) frustrating and funny at the same time [eh]
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then (err)
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
you know like <malay>malas-malas</malay> to to come
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
(uh)
self guilt [lah] I think so I don't know [lah]
so emotional then <malay>merajuk</malay>
ya
cement
[oh]
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship [lah]
ya
ya the was
(uh) ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him [lah] probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain [oh] ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery [lah] but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
(mm) ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare [lah] how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how [lah]
which one we we want to choose
ya <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>bilang</malay> you [lah] (uh) (err) <malay>kita kasi dia orang</malay> arrange
<malay>kita kasi</malay> arrange <malay>yang yang rendah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita</malay>
<malay>kita kita pun</malay>
<malay>mungkin</malay> will markup
or work <malay>kita punya</malay> budget so <malay>kita kasi</malay> them
arrange <malay>yang yang rendah sikit</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so
(mm)
ya
actually ya [lah] <malay>macam lampu ini semua kita dah</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita dia punya</malay> cost <malay>itu kita boleh kurang kurangkan lagi</malay> [ah]
(uh) <malay>banyak banyak kirakan banyak juga</malay> [lah] <malay>kita dah tukar yang sikit-sikit ini dah banyak juga</malay>
<malay>tukar lampu</malay>
so I mean <malay>sekarang ini yang</malay> the more <malay>yang lebih</malay>
major major [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana berapa dia orang akan</malay> quote
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) the the other time I I I
I <malay>tanya</malay> quotation ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> toilet <malay>itu kalau dua</malay> toilet
<malay>kurang-kurang pun</malay> at least <malay>satu</malay> toilet <malay>pun</malay> at least maybe three four K
<malay>dua</malay> toilet is around <malay>lapan</malay> K just toilet
[kan]
one (uh) so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package [ah]
[oh]
<malay>itu sekali terus habuk kirakan termasuk</malay> kitchen <malay>dapur bahagian sana</malay> [lah] <malay>sekaligus</malay> [ah]
ya
[kan] might as well [kan]
<malay>nak berhabuk biar berhabuk terus</malay>
<malay>tak yang yang bilik tak yang</malay> master bedroom vinyl <malay>kita</malay> almost thousand
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
thousand four thousand [ah] <malay>seribu lima seribu</malay>
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
<malay>datang</malay>
<malay>apa yang bilik bilik</malay> master <malay>kita nak buka</malay>
<malay>nak buka buat apa</malay>
<malay>agaknya</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau nak</malay> ya [lah] <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>memang</malay> I <malay>murah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>leceh</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>bayar lebih sikit biar</malay> the <malay>biar yang yang yang</malay> the experts
do it
<malay>nanti minta siapa nanti sendiri yang nanti</malay>
ya <malay>tapi bilik ini dia punya</malay> flooring
<malay>kena tukar juga</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
yes <malay>dia sejuk panas sejuk panas</malay> [ha] <malay>tengok ini dah merekah</malay> [lah]
that <malay>yang yang</malay>
<malay>dia merekah nanti jadi macam</malay> [ah] master bedroom [ah] <malay>sebelum sebelum itu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam masuk air semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti itu dah sebab</malay> <malay>sebelah</malay>
<malay>sebelah</malay> toilet <malay>itu yang masuk air semua itu yang sampai terpecah</malay>
<malay>sampai menggelembung</malay> [eh]
<malay>ini ini bukan</malay> ya <malay>ini bukan yang</malay>
I don't think this the <malay>ini</malay> vinyl <malay>yang</malay>
so so so <malay>tengok</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> master bedroom we do it around <malay>berapa</malay> [eh] thousand
okay [lah] thousand five [ah] [eh]
so <malay>kalau mungkin dua bilik ini mungkin</malay>
[oh] <malay>mungkin dalam dua ribu ke agaknya</malay> estimate <malay>nya</malay>
ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>kita pun kita punya</malay> budget <malay>pun tak banyak</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita buat yang yang</malay> urgent <malay>dulu</malay> [lah]
<malay>sejuk</malay> [ah]
so I think ya [lah]
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in (uh) (uh) in the future we have (uh)
<malay>kalau ada ada</malay> baby <malay>baru ke</malay> so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety <malay>dia tak keras sangat</malay>
<malay>kalau jatuh pun</malay> at least <malay>dia ada macam</malay> (uh) cushion this vinyl [kan] underneath <malay>dia ada</malay> cushion [kan]
then <malay>tak sejuk sangat</malay>
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
[ah]
ya
kitchen <malay>punya</malay> flooring
<malay>yang yang</malay> I I saw one of the picture you send
send me the one
with the kitchen <malay>punya</malay>
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring [ah]
I think that [one] is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that [one] the the more expensive one
(mm)
but have to
you have to ya [lah] everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
but (uh) ya the one that we saw <malay>kak</malay> #doro# using I think !wah!
if we have the the budget can consider [lah] I think that one's quite expensive is around
!wah! but I find it like very good [leh]
and it's wireless
(mm)
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
(uh) brands (uh)
(uh) have that those type of (uh) two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that [one] very good [ah] (uh) I think
can can consider [lah] if we have the means
but now we !aiya! we see how for now we just use manually first [ah]
use the sucking mop [ah]
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
(uh) sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive [ah]
ya that [one] really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence [ah] because like I told you earlier on
(err) ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence [lah]
ya
(mm)
the specific (uh) ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
[ah] ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well [lah]
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
(mm)
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally [lah] ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya [lah] like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) I think this saturday we we settle (uh) #akid's# (uh) school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare #akid# (uh) school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
(uh) the the the the renovation [ah]
(mm) so actually we K we we need to ya [lah] we ours we we are the one who should
direct them [oh] we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration [ah]
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but [ah] ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want
