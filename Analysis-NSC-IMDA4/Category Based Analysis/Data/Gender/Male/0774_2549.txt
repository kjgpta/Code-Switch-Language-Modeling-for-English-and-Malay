okay I think we're recording
(err) so my name is #Umar# and my conversation partner today is
so
so <malay>ini hari</malay> we will be talking about corona virus
(err) in Singapore and how so far <malay>kita kat sini</malay> at home and (uh) my family <malay>semua</malay> how we've been coping
(err) with all the jobs and all the (um) confinement <malay>semua kat rumah</malay>
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how I've been interacting <malay>dengan</malay> all my friends [lah] basically
so okay obviously okay I start [eh] so basically (um)
<malay>bila</malay> we heard about all this (um)
corona virus thing (err) <malay>dulu</malay> back then I was somewhat employed [lah]
then after that (um) when we heard about this corona virus issue actually I was in #Jakarta# (err) celebrating Chinese new year [lah]
<malay>terus</malay> (um) when I heard about it at first (err) it didn't seem like such a big deal [lah] because (um)
people over there were quite (err) <malay>rilek</malay> they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
(err) maybe it won't be as such a big issue [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> after that when I came back (um)
I was given a couple of mask <malay>tapi</malay> I thought like okay [lah] not really necessary but (err) eventually it turns out that
(um) the the the hype so called or the whole issue (err) it it went up and then
so that time <malay>bila</malay> we saw it on the news (err) my my girlfriend's (uh) auntie [lah] so <malay>dia kasi</malay>
(uh) because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only <malay>macam</malay> ten masks or so something like this
<malay>habis</malay> (um) ask us to use it (err) when we are at the airport <malay>sebab</malay> (err) who knows [kan] especially Indonesia <malay>agaknya</malay> maybe
not so safe [lah] and then (err) so I flew back I still wear the mask (uh) at first I thought <malay>macam</malay> too much [ah] actually <malay>macam</malay> maybe
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore (um) and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then (um) the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and (uh) at first I was going to work and slowly (um) you see more and more people
<malay>kat</malay> station <malay>pakai</malay> mask <malay>habis</malay> (um) some of them (err) they there was no form of social distancing [ah] back then so there was no such advice but
mask <malay>ada</malay> quite a number of people they were wearing it [lah] and then (um) they decided to
eventually (err) make an announcement on and said that <malay>dia punya</malay> mask <malay>ini semua</malay> actually not mandatory [lah] at first then <malay>cakap</malay> only <malay>kalau macam</malay> you sick (err) you stay at home
(err) just <malay>jaga</malay> yourself [lah] there's no need to go out (um) and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
(um) slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt <malay>banyak orang orang macam</malay> didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe (err) eventually (um) it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic [lah] <malay>habis</malay> Malaysia <malay>orang</malay> Malaysia affected <malay>orang</malay> Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to <malay>macam</malay> got on the list [lah]
[ah] so at first we were the first <malay>habis</malay>
(um) we were eventually taken over by (um) okay [eh] at first it was China [lah] and then second it was Singapore
at first [ah] this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries (uh) in Italy
(err) in Euro and then slowly got to America and now <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita</malay> in a state where (um)
is the highest [lah] so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
(err) but that's how I remembered my experience (um) when it first started (err) and how at that point of time I was
employed <malay>habis sekarang macam</malay> like looking for job because (uh)
let's put it like (um) I wasn't employed anymore (err) after this whole situation so now looking for job [lah]
how about your experience <malay>macam mana</malay> you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think <malay>siapa siapa</malay> anyone [lah] was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted <malay>banyak</malay> (um) even home based business at some point was (err) affected [kan]
(uh) that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less <malay>macam</malay> slammed her
some authority figure [ah]
ya but (err) because of what she said a lot of people <malay>macam tak</malay> satisfied [lah] <malay>diorang macam</malay>
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
(um) <malay>kena pulau rabak rabak</malay> [lah] basically because of her statement she even
ya and
I think
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or <malay>niat dia</malay> the <malay>niat</malay> is there [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good <malay>macam nak tolong</malay> all these regulation issue [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay [lah] I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
<malay>tapi</malay> because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is (um) what she should have done was
after she did it and of course <malay>nak</malay> return <malay>balik dia punya</malay> statement <malay>susah</malay> [kan] but at least <malay>macam</malay> just go out there and just apologize properly
and say that (uh) you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen (err)
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say (err) I understand
<malay>tapi</malay> she chose to <malay>macam</malay> go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that (err) gone viral for no reason
(um)
and (err) some of them are funny <malay>macam</malay> the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend #Hadi# because okay to be fair <malay>sebab</malay>
#Hadi# dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see #Hadi# [kan]
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
<malay>habis</malay> he will <malay>macam</malay> [ah] be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants <malay>cuma</malay> bike is slightly different [lah]
like the first time I saw it <malay>macam</malay> this could be #Hadi#
it could really have been #Hadi# the way they dress <malay>dia punya seluar dengan dia punya</malay> helmet <malay>dia punya</malay> visor
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny [ah] but I saw the article [lah] I think Mothership covered this article about him
(uh) unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but (uh) I think a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> does really
(um) <malay>macam</malay> it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite (uh) positive feedback [ah] about the guy <malay>dia</malay> super extra [ah]
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes [kan]
because if you think about it (um) just the fact that during this whole (uh) circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
and (um) while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large <malay>tapi macam</malay> it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say <malay>macam</malay> this guy this #mat# just <malay>naik</malay> motor <malay>habis</malay> just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that <malay>dia macam</malay> very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
(err) actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
(err) the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
(mm) (mm)
(mm) well I have this opinion about (uh) all these food delivery [ah] so to my understanding [ah]
(err) the first <malay>tak salah</malay> Deliveroo was to start all this <malay>tapi</malay> in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something [lah]
but what I really feel about food delivery is <malay>dia macam</malay> quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second [ah] about Grab drivers (err) not Grab drivers
but (err) food delivery [eh] so I feel that (um) it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all (um)
people who are do food delivery all this <malay>kalau</malay> they really <malay>macam</malay> really work hard macam #chiong# all the way [ah] <malay>macam</malay> maybe eight hours #chiong# all the way <malay>macam</malay> #Hadi# for example [kan]
(um) they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on <malay>macam mana</malay> they hit <malay>dia punya</malay> incentive or <malay>macam mana</malay> they hit <malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) hours or <malay>dia punya</malay> right timing [ah] because all these riders [kan] <malay>macam dorang</malay> [dah] experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right <malay>kedai mana</malay> (um)
prepare food quickly <malay>kedai mana</malay> prepare food very slow they know how to play the game [lah] basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and they are blue (err) blue collar workers [kan] so think about this for a second [eh] to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to (um) like basically if you apply [kan] most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize <malay>macam</malay> your delivery [ah]
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for (uh) the lower income group to catch up
to the upper income group because <malay>macam</malay> especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery <malay>macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars (uh) or something [ah] per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay> beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it [kan] so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar (err) job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about (err) food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
no much prerequisite [lah] maybe if you <malay>macam nak</malay> deliver <malay>naik motor</malay> [kan] then
[ah] <malay>kena pakai lesen</malay> you have to prove your <malay>lesen</malay> [lah] but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview (err) <malay>macam</malay> documentary [lah] don't know on Grab and how (err) some of the handicap people
(um) they managed to get jobs in Grab <malay>macam dulu</malay> (um) when they before Grab [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say <malay>macam</malay> if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes <malay>tapi ada orang macam</malay> down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know <malay>macam</malay> is like a big <malay>macam beban</malay>
<malay>duduk kat rumah jadi beban</malay> [jer] <malay>puas hati macam</malay> you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this (uh) girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair [lah]
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day [lah] for example on her electric (err) wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver [lah] maybe <malay>satu hari</malay> deliver four or five items [lah] for example
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is [ah] okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is (um) you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet [lah]
so <malay>macam berdikari</malay> [lah] so instead of
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
the interface <malay>macam</malay> the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
(err) it it simplifies the task basically <malay>pergi sendiri</malay> pick up <malay>pergi sana</malay> drop off so it it it gives this
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to (err)
admin position or something <malay>macam kena</malay> interview <malay>tak tahu</malay> pass <malay>ke tak</malay> (err) your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless <malay>macam kalau</malay> too saturated or something [lah] there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
(um) the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how (uh) blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers <malay>punya</malay> salary
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway (um) with regards to that (uh) there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
(err) (err) employment
(err) I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate <malay>macam</malay>
you you don't get (err) you don't get denied (err) okay <malay>selalunya</malay> the idea is when you do the employment [kan] (err) you cannot be judged based on your I don't know (err) race or
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis [lah] in singapore so whether you are (uh) as mentioned before whether you are
(err) low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide [kan]
so <malay>macam</malay> for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver [kan]
so (err) <malay>nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah</malay> so when you're tired you get home
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab (err) you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your (err) (err) picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
so that so called keep them motivated [lah] whereas <malay>macam</malay> delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really (err) let's say you already have a bicycle [lah] let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
and you don't have that burden of [oh] <malay>hari ini kena buat sepuluh</malay> delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
so it it simplifies a little bit
[ah] yes okay definitely [lah] so basically <malay>macam</malay> you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars (err) what you get
is (um) basically is through the app <malay>punya</malay> interface [ah] so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours [lah]
it's it's already a net amount <malay>dorang</malay> already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off (err) because sometimes
for example (um) whatever the food is <malay>dorang</malay> [dah] minus the food amount so (err) this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
<malay>terus</malay> (err) whatever is shown in your phone <malay>macam</malay> you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example [ah] that's yours [lah] basically
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
you are okay let's say you are riding <malay>habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan</malay>
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> !ee! I still got to go on I need to hit (um) ten deliveries today or (uh) I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
it has that sort of it extended flexibility [ah] and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way [lah] it's just something I just thought about recently
and how it is a good way for people <malay>macam</malay> let's say they have spare time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say they work nine to five
<malay>habis malam macam</malay> they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then (err) just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
maybe (err) do a three hour trip (err) three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home [lah] so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
(uh) as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that (um) a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such (uh) active (um) kind of employment especially for the lower income (uh) people to help a bridge to the higher income people
(err) ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> [dah] starting so much on delivery
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
(err) it does
(um) so during the circuit breaker period of [pe] was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing (um) did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery (err) did you meet anyone or
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to <malay>buku letak kat tepi
[oh] okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
what sort of (err) security feature or identification <malay>yang dorang</malay> implement
[kan] <malay>risau</malay>
no [lah] if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say [eh] I'm doing this (err) exam (err) next week
(err) I pay you two hundred dollars [lah] just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay [pe]
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already <malay>macam</malay> <malay>kirim salam</malay> [ah]
seriously
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle [lah] but you think that you are <malay>macam</malay> everything [dah] okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project <malay>kerja</malay> just to survive on the salary from that job
(um) but I kudos to you [lah] <malay>memang</malay> is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
right well characters is something inevitable
or Facebook <malay>ada</malay> politics [pe] <malay>sekolah pun ada</malay> politics [pe] but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
in school <malay>walaupun</malay> you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever <malay>belajar</malay> but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that <malay>macam</malay> there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying <malay>macam nak</malay> enjoy <malay>susah</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> okay it it depends on people right so (um)
I think also it depends on school as well [ah] because when I was in uni (uh) (um) a lot of people who went to like me [kan] they (err)
two major popular universities that they went to is either or [eh] so <malay>macam sekolah</malay> so basically you study throughout the whole year
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
whereas for the one that I went to basically (err) <malay>buat</malay> project
(err) it it it becomes like what (uh) eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent <malay>kat belakang</malay> exam
so in a way you can balance [oh] out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you have <malay>macam ada</malay> solid group you can work with
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but (err)
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours <malay>ada</malay> project [kan]
sometimes (err) if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
(err) for a couple of years you actually (um) understand and appreciate what (err) higher academia can bring compared
to your peers (err) in school at the moment [kan] even for myself [kan] if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and (um) if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or (uh) it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to <malay>macam</malay> all these <malay>budak budak</malay> they still have not have a taste of full life <malay>macam</malay> full working employment yet
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
(um) you know it's the uncertainty of (err) okay [lah]
you know if I don't do well then don't do well [lah] you know but (uh) once you are in a position where you are out
that's why I think a lot of my friends <malay>yang</malay> (um) went to you uni SIM basically (err) university
night university [lah] so <malay>dia orang</malay> juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life [ah] there's no more social life basically
(err) <malay>pagi pagi</malay> daytime you go to work and then (err) malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time <malay>nak buat</malay> (err) <malay>nak buat</malay> group assignment <malay>nak</malay> study <malay>untuk</malay> exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
is very exhausting and (um) some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful (err) well kudos them
ya there's a lot of compromise (err) and you have to be willing to <malay>macam</malay> at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social [lah] because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
no [lah] at first to be honest [ah] at first <malay>bila</malay> all this thing happen [kan] <malay>macam</malay> (um) it's interesting (err) because is something novel
<malay>macam</malay> is not common <malay>apa dulu</malay> to to (um) communicate through okay maybe for you [lah] but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family <malay>tapi</malay> when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
(err) at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime (uh) <malay>kerja</malay> (err) in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward <malay>macam</malay> I think it depends on people also [lah] because <malay>ada orang ada orang boleh</malay> focus when they're at home
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks [lah] toilet [lah]
or the bed sleep [lah] take a nap during lunch time <malay>tu semua</malay> for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas <malay>kalau macam kat tempat kerja</malay> you've got to drag your ass and then
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people (um)
they switch into mode you know <malay>macam</malay> home mode (err) <malay>duduk kat rumah macam</malay>
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing <malay>punya</malay> mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is <malay>macam</malay> all wax style and then
[ah] you know you're wearing clothes (um) and then you go out and [eh] you you just have that vibe <malay>macam</malay> I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know <malay>macam</malay> when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
(err) I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
(um) if doubly is even a word for studying
so !aiya! I mean so
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in (um) I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in <malay>dia punya</malay> scheduling and stuff like that <malay>tapi</malay>
I don't know [eh] ultimately it is a state of mind [lah] so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
<malay>macam dekat rumah</malay> you can just eat <malay>macam</malay> you can snack and all that shit (err) but <malay>kalau kat luar</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> you need to walk for it and (uh) I don't know
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you (err) do delivery (uh) I think the so called delivery fee is about <malay>macam</malay> four dollars something like this [kan]
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type (err) Foodpanda pro
and you can actually see they have <malay>macam</malay> those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package <malay>tak salah</malay> is (err)
