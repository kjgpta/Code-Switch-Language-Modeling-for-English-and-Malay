apa you belajar kat sana
then which one which one your most favourite ah mana satu
my course ah my course is uh also known as apa uh marine engineering
like dia macam um okay so basically
like my job progression kan lepas
err apa err diploma kan is like working either apa the sailing or or at a shipyard gitu ah
okay for third year aku rasa uh aku what ah
so like um for me I I pick the shipyard job ah because I heard of like very good like uh what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing ah because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing uh bila kau sail kan uh macam
enam months like that
six month gitu ah away from your families lah which I don't think I personally think I cannot ah you know
but it's definitely something aku macam look forward to ah like in in the future ah gitu
then also apa eh okay um apa dia eh oh okay
but like I planning to ah so now apa eh uh my first year kan ah I only got to like try out the different ah so like we all can like
apa choose ah the various types of sports or
kat sekolah we you can choose ah so I for the for me I pick the apa floorball lah like something new lah for me like I never try before ah
apa eh uh
quite fun ah you know enjoyable your ah kawan kawan you know quite fun ah
apa sport I prefer
ah apa eh okay got offer quite a few sport ah
you know you got apa soccer and basketball got tchoukball gitu
but I I don't know ah for poly I maybe won't pick like apa eh
uh clubs as in macam
got like the engineering dia ada punya business
then macam
I was planning to join ah in the first year tapi
apa eh uh tak dapat like you must go for apa
like I talk banyak tau
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I tak dapat you know
but hopefully if I tried apply again dapat ah
like for your course other than like programming gitu
for me personally kan uh I enjoy the apa workshop ah not for like year one
because I apa secondary school I pilih ah what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology ah
so like for me is uh is fun lah cause it's actually something new ah some s- some of the what uh workshop practice or something you like welding uh you got the two types of welding macam gas welding ngan apa
arc welding ah something new ah then I macam lepak lepak you know
but err on workshop cause I workshop ah aku rasa macam four hours ah gitu
then okay for my course right uh they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like uh different kind of apa eh dia punya skills ah
err apa they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like dia macam ada
if you just go for interview eh no sorry my bad but instead of interview apa eh uh internship when you go for internship err what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
uh purifier room okay purifier room is macam like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right err you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test ah it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
if I'm not wrong kita will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me ah cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly macam like inspection you know like okay as
ape benda like other things I do other than in school lah
kay for me right apa eh uh in my free time I like to game you know
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right uh I start off with mobile gaming ah then I started moving to apa dia punya competitive scene ah
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two ah then the prizes macam uh gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
ya so you obviously ada experience kan
mm can lah you just you just go for it ah dulu
ah okay lah because like semalam I got study like the whole night you know like macam two
at three gitu I went for an appointment ah
how should I say macam
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say apa eh uh it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation ah so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like apa eh
legit all the makcik makcik atuk atuk oi all queuing up lah
gitu then
once they cut open they take out the apa
macam a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
apa eh
you suka apa
uh do like apa small business eh is it is that what you do
ah ya calligraphy business when uh like apa notebook ah
what do I normally do kat rumah eh
the apa uh apa airports cover business obviously not bad ah the business the profits ah ya
like the apa the Paris Disneyland
ya aduh
but but then macam there would definitely be still restriction lah you know like beach maximum capacity
but then again if like apa dia punya deadline is like
I don't do right then my will be affected apa
ah apa our school work ah ya
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course ada tak
like for this semester one kan uh I have this uh project called the module name is which is apa eh uh
so like uh we all macam is
uh two from then macam two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for apa uh
macam a few weeks ago before our final group project so like uh it was during uh hari raya haji right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to uh help them with something and present then when I tell them macam I say I cannot ah I like damn busy today I got my
they should know the different type of apa
err the type of programs dia punya different types of software ah to do like animation ke
tapi kan I tell you ah these guys kan is even the girls tau
they diorang semua they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of apa different type of drawing you know
is to help people with depression you know so like apa eh uh we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
more with macam err people ah online people online ah like strangers you know not in not strangers lah
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing ah like apa the apa the
then our app also ada you have err what ah you have the therapy consultation tab
since our app is based on uh like I said the apa eh the macam Pokemon kan like the virtual pet right
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins ah basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to macam what I decide to do ah
so like the shop right we also have a shop ah the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put err like the what ah poke food poke food includes like the apa
cause like usually my what when I go for interviews I rarely aku macam uh rarely know what to say ah
kirakan oh K K
so lepas
we all have to uh macam go back to you know to kasi balik the coins
but then again you did what during uh bulan puasa
ah it's damn hot then you thirsty then you want to makan right

then I thought like okay lah maybe cause tak cukup tidur ke tak
salah bantal something like that
hey lah how are you man dah lama tak jumpa
really really long time semenjak aku last jumpa you right so how long do you think kita dah lama tak jumpa
no I think kita tak jumpa for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right err last year when do you remember bila dia start
COVID bulan sebelas COVID bulan
okay COVID november ya so I I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so dah lama gila
early last year you know what what I can remember from my memory aku rasa is that
aku baru balik daripada my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that kita dah tak jumpa lagi for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
err my mum bilang aku yang nurul is pregnant was pregnant and then after that eh
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and asal kau tak jumpa dia
and we used to be very very good friends semenjak kita orang kecil lagi
lah you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time kita orang jumpa I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet abeh kau nak berbual english pun dah susah kan
err from my memory is that we went for apa tau performance ya you know that that was like some bengkel kanak-kanak or some do you know remember aksi mat yoyo when we used to be there was remember that show aksi mat yoyo it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
err we met up at mak long punya okay so mak long aminah suriga is the like the producer for those kinds of err shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes pasal dia it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know
mm mak long
then kita orang and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so aku I remembered that ah kita start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are kawan baik
aku pun tak tahu how they became friends eh yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you dulu
rumah mak long correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows dekat err bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam performance and then I remembered doing shows kat situ with my sister dengan your sister dengan you together so it's sriwana yes yes you see now it's all coming back
yes I think kita orang were quite active in performance because I remember um quite vividly there was this particular show kita orang semua nak kena remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a kebun is it kebun in malay
engkau ada topeng lah but I do not have a topeng so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because lembu kan ada horns right so I need to be a lembu with horns so what I did was during the song of um old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing dia orang punya topeng
kita happy go lucky just go with the flow mak cakap apa kita buat then after that jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu then just joget
you were a duck I remembered kau itik kau itik because they had if you remember there was this disney nya itik
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya ya ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be err not confirm just to be sure lah kan kita orang ni iya lah kan
err I remember that you were donald duck and kau joget macam biasa lah you were happy confidently you know yes
err you were itik okay so
lupa ah so err the next memory is bila aku dengan kau we were in your dad's car
baru balik daripada some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right kat luar some lah community centre dulu dia orang cakap apa ah
ya ya ya we all so it was it was actually quite err at that point of time I did remember that kita orang we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then I I I remembered that err we were doing good stuff lah which we did not know was good at that time
ya err aku pun ingat yang that that we get to perform then after that balik so getting back to the memory yang in your dad's car aku ingat bapa kau because your your your bapa was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam
okay cool cool but I remember kereta tu kecil then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right right so every time kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke and so we were at the back dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like oh so we made so much noise that the the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now kita dah tua ni kan it was very it was because it happened by mm ya so I'm not sure okay so your
pasal your bapa suddenly pusing belakang then cakap can you guys stop it or not
so I was err you know I got quite scared of your dad daripada hari tu aku macam eh hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these lah and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes aku rasa
maybe dia bingit ya I mean we kita orang deserved it seratus percent we deserved it
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know err I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that nak bilang kau jer that was a memory ah ya your turn
I remember those moments of education yang aku tak
really oh that was so sweet of you aku feel so err yes
yes aku terharu orang cakap so
really pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa
engkau bukan seorang ya
oh I remember I know where you're going with this I aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda
ya I I I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well pasal aku ingat at that point of time kan you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle ada tank warna kuning it's a bicycle with a yellow colour tank then lepas tu ada seat kat belakang
untuk kau duduk then after that that bicycle kecil tau tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang each other it's a chopper
I I I I try to describe it ah so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are tengah hisap rokok ah
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any macam dustbin tak kan
it oh ya yup yup near our house ah ya the one opposite our house kat rumah bawah block farhan if you remember correctly
salah brother love
john J A B C D E F G H aku pun tak tahu
ya I aku understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then kita lupa nama dia and then after that nama dia apa then we will go through all alphabetically just to try and eh he looks like a john you know oh ya ya he is a john so we I I go through that thing also I believe apa tau lah like they did err they did a study about this dia orang cakap apa tau siapa yang dulu um buat show dengan mak long gitu
mm siapa siapa the kids that buat show dengan sriwana so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if err if you know like if I get to see her eh mak long hi remember me she probably wouldn't pasal ya
ya you can say that I have a janggut it's okay because I I saw you staring at my janggut and aku realise yang kau tengok dengan macam
ya ya I mean like to continue the whole janggut thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do kalau if you don't mind janggut ni sebenarnya apa tau if for me kan aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas
aku malas mm
ya because I realise bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk
ya but gemuk is okay because you know err I I don't mind but
like I am one year younger than you if kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka jer nampak macam ten years older from you and of course aku punya attitude is very mature
err yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other kita akan jumpa each other bila err macam nak balik sekolah so kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan thing sometimes
okay okay I I try to I try to from my memory lah because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so err what happened was err after primary school kan pergi secondary school tapi aku went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from yishun you see I went to saint andrew's school err which is located dekat potong pasir so jauh ah saint andrew's kat potong pasir so saint andrew's dekat potong pasir err aku had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school kan mula pukul tujuh setengah
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty pagi then after that make my way to school by taking the or the bus so I start my journey probably around pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah then after that
normal timing correct so during that point of time we jarang jumpa each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
dekat dengan kau punya rumah so which is northland secondary school
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because err there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking kau punya pemandangan kan
that what you must be like terkencing dalam seluar eh
confirm kena rotan with your mom confirm kena rotan with your mom I remembered because your mom is err your mom is very strict err woman from bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam quite err err how to say how should I put it eh verbal
ya she's she's fine with me I I I I actually you know what I I love her until now because sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih best friends you know I mean I mean not as close lah because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that datang balik fade away datang balik but I I appreciate the
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my mak aku punya birthday ya and guess how old my mak aku is
mak aku is sixty six years old lah that is err there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for bulan puasa punya time
bulan puasa punya time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or kita pergi sembahyang jumaat
yes so we did lah but not not not for a very long time lah sekejap aje kita lepak then after that err I bumped into your dad
err he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said eh uncle err how are you because your dad always speaks in english then mak kau berbual melayu so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
ah then after that um ya so um your dad aku jumpa dia then after that err you did ask me this question before eh bapa aku umur seventy almost almost eighty years old kau cakap gitu dengan aku then aku ingat macam eh
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda tau
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad lah my dad will exercise tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke he should be at home or dia keluar rumah
amazing macam bapa aku juga my my dad will wake up like early
but tapi you know looking at him stretching aku rasa he is still you know quite active in that sense pasal sekarang
err during on his birthday right two years ago I think aku belikan dia basikal for his birthday present then sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar as often
ya rather than to just stay home watch blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now kan dia orang dia orang kasih err facilities for the old people untuk dia orang workout
correct ya yes correct correct so err what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to masuk class ah join a class yang singapore punya funding
I forgot what is it called future or something like that skillsfuture ya so dia orang ada this skillsfuture punya thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some err security course so ya so
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards bila kau nampak kat condo then after that eh uncle how are you
okay lah same same lah like yesterday also takde ubah sama aje like that lah
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking pasal kita orang punya growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road lah sekarang
yes yes that's a good segway actually because um I mean it it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially pasal aku realise engkau sampai sekarang masih macam err doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still buat kau punya music semua
hmm okay err is it it's due to the whole COVID punya situation sekarang kan
oh you do err facebook punya session like live punya session is it oh that's cool you know what I found out that err one of our friend's apa ni boy cazly because I did meet up err met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time lah so sekarang dia
when we hang out that time dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook punya account I am not a
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information daripada you know the social media but untuk aku I
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time macam
the reason why I do that is just tak banyak sangat information coming in from left to right too many points too many um you know opinions from the social media dia punya community
tak I don't know kalau does that make sense to kalau aku cakap I I like to be alone and I'm not lonely hmm do I have an imaginary kawan
okay so like basically just to be updated dengan dia orang ah
so what you're telling me that you have like err you have you are talking about facebook right okay so dalam kau punya facebook tu you post like funny funny things
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you pasal engkau I I I realise I mean knowing you as a friend for for a very long time you are very positive err person seseorang yang positive lah senang cakap
because how can this guy selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada jer macam funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer I will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang whatever oh so then you know that that's just me but for you right I realise as a person and I really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya pasal sekarang ni
you know there are a lot of um negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube I do go to youtube though tengok comment comments kadang-kadang video video guitar lah music whatever so there I will I like to read the comments because they are just
ya ya ya this is relative to dalam bidang kugiran music selamat hari raya kepada all the people in singapore
hmm I'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful kepada diri engkau
actually aku pun aku pun suka orang malaysia lah but depends orang I mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person macam mana kau treat orang tapi orang malaysia pasal aku ada banyak sedara my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes
my mother is from penang my mum is from my grandmother is originally from thailand so what happened was that err dia orang fell in love then after that my grandmother and my grandfather err ran away dia orang lari kahwin lari
kahwin lari so daripada penang tu aku punya datuk macam this is a true story ya this is a true story so err what happened was my they fell in love I don't know how maybe under a tree then after that err datuk arwah datuk aku
yes so err that's the maternal side um my mum's father lah so err arwah datuk aku tu
dia I think he was from thailand also
okay I'm not sure oh no he's from like like descendants of india or something like that lah gedebak gedebuk then after that err they fell in love
under a tree bawah pokok then after that balik lari pergi ke penang for them to get married
wait let me get it straight nenek kau punya kakak which is your
wow that is banyak anak untuk tujuh belas is a lot of kids lah tujuh belas is that's like a that's a factory plus reserves ya plus reserves wow what a woman wow so this is your grand aunty right
memang banyak ah they have like you know like banyak
ya so seventeen is quite a number aku rasa
of numbers so err back to my my my grandparents then after that they got married then err they stayed in penang dia orang duduk kat penang then after that my at one point of time my grandfather like went to singapore and he got a job here in singapore where he became a policeman also something like that I'm not sure aku lupa
then after that err duduk dekat err barrack police err together with my father's father which is my paternal grandfather ah so they became best friends they became best friends then after that my err my mak aku dengan bapak aku
match is it how you is that how you say it matchmake ke apa
matchmake melayu cakap apa eh kalau matchmake melayu cakap apa
kahwin kahwin kahwin kahwin yes kuih kahwin kahwin try lah kuih saya kuih kahwin kahwin married married okay um so so so they they they were matchmake then dia orang kahwin err then after that a few years later dapat kakak aku
kakak aku is currently dekat hong-kong sekarang as you know then he she has her own family kat sana they're happy over there they plan to come back actually for december lah ya they actually bought the tickets and everything then lepas tu err because of the whole current COVID situation dia orang terpaksa cancel dia orang punya flight lah
his name is a tricky one lah err pasal dia pasal bapak dia is a french dude then my sister is malay right so um
nama dia is luq L U Q and then after that ada L U Q luq luq luq
kita orang ada luqman orang melayu ada luqman ya so err
luq lucien so that lucien tu is very particular pasal orang french kau nak kena pronounce dia orang punya language in you know because they they they love their language so much it's and I agree that it's very sexy language aku memang suka bila orang french berbual
you know pasal tak kisah lelaki ke perempuan ke orang tua ke orang muda ke the language itself is just
very sexy it's not beautiful it's just sexy hmm so I like how they they pronounce err stuff and the way they talk especially bila dia orang dah start berbual french abeh nak start berbual english lagi sexy lah but let's not get too deep on the on the sexy part nak kena
okay music part oh so okay sorry you're you're you're done with me ah with my family alright I guess aku rasa aku punya family tak interested tak interesting aku rasa okay ah berbual pasal music ah no lah nah I'm just I'm just kidding that's why that's why I love you lah because you ah whatever mean things that I think is quite mean and then when I say it to you right you
you don't mind and you just brush me off with a laugh and whatever and I really appreciate that some people kau apa ni berbual pasal aku punya keluarga macam gini you know that kind of thing ah
terbawa-bawa terbawa-bawa abeh balik rumah then after that they will scream in the pillow
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to macam apa yang kau berbual tadi
roughly um you know um err as you know I'm working from home right now right so aku ada banyak time kat rumah then I could been listening to no at first I bought a I bought a guitar I don't know guitar apa nak beli you know this is this is a typical um you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just pasal aku ada banyak time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes lah as you know aku dulu main drum asal it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated oh ya you do
yang penting kau terror wow that should be that should be your next err malay album punya yang penting kau terror
dengar lah kita orang punya record baru which is called yang penting kau terror
ya dan sekarang aku main guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication nak kena invest kau punya time main guitar and you and I I have to say I start I started quite late lah I started quite late then after
I when when I get to know you again during the secondary school punya time at the point of kan kau dah start main guitar you know and all this kau dah start main cranberries kau dah ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and aku pula when I was in saint andrew's school kan aku belajar drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then bila kita masuk band together we had a few of our friends then kita masuk a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
yang penting kita terror yes just like your the name of your future album
ya yes pasal okay err the reason why I got myself into the whole which is electronic dance music pasal
at that point of time kita orang punya band dah tak ada lagi then after that kita orang decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives gedebak gedebuk so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to um dance music
some techno punya stuff some err defected err record stuff which is quite cheesy lah to be honest with you like err they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor punya beats macam that kind of music so mm
so aku dengar um techno aku dengar tech house then there were few other house punya genres ah so they they had err like like like different
genres like sub genres ah within that that genres so I listen to specifically macam tech house deep house that kind of thing so err it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
err I had a I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started then after that kita orang dapat a few gigs kat sentosa dapat main kat club gedebak gedebuk we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect kalau nak buat music tu I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a and to mix like
a a disc jockey dia orang punya kerja ni is to mix err satu lagu dengan satu lagu
so dia tak ada stop ah
yes for so for example macam ada satu lagu if he's playing in turntable A right so that lagu belongs to an artist correct so from my err end of it I would like to produce my own track I I would love to have my music in the in the playlist
lagu original it's preferable lah you know you know that's the reason why like kalau nak have a band to play err like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have err you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so aku rasa that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya chord belajar dia orang punya style of music
in that kind of genre lah in that kind of context mm ya I mean the whole thing for me aku rasa tak
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was ya I was playing in like um in sentosa which is an outdoor punya outdoor like
disco discotheque mak mak cakap discotheque kau pergi discotheque tak ah pergi discotheque ah mak
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I I was the resident there for every sunday and then lepas tu aku manage to do my own company so I hooked up with err a friend of mine then after um together he was from america then we kita orang joined forces
err aku rasa aku wait wait sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa that was quite some time ago err so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then kita launched kita orang punya own party ah so then we had we fly in the we flew in their to play gedebak gedebuk then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created I created art not say I created I mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment err value to singapore which which is at the highest standard err at that point of time then kita orang
buat duit apart from that you know we err charged people at the door kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat bar
so we managed to make err money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail dalam tu then ya lah
err now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing aku punya guitar
out there in the youtube world sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam youtube you know

I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was gila seh
ya bila lah boleh travel lagi macam camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
bila time nak makan we can makan or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
what fifty plus lima puluh
sabar sabar sabar he actually did it
pergi pub eh pergi pub hot chocolate wow
eh so was the first time that you felt snow or macam how was it ah macam sejuk gila ke or like how was it
oh okay eh tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk ah I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right macam hot chocolate or like
eh hot chocolate dekat
yup yup correct ah rindu seh tu
yang the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then bila wombat tu macam bau kita punya makanan wah he just like crawled up to our door
ya eh how come tak ambil gambar seh
tu ah kecoh saje
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like kesian when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ah lepas COVID pergi mana eh
dia penat gila ah you have to break and make lots of stops right
ya I really hope this goes away soon seh K tak sabar
you can actually leave your car over there kan macam
so macam like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport ah there was car
tapi rasa macam you macam boring gitu
eh selamat tak seasick eh
weirdly I miss the supermarkets kelakar kan kelakar tak
they are just so lain right
ya lah that's one of our ways that kita nak save duit kan
I don't know I rasa apa dah pakai
err wait err K let me recall eh van diemen's was the one yang kat farm right
and then there was gelato messina which was dekat bandar like the city area
and gelato messina was eh what flavours were there lupa ah
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and macam all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato messina was like hip ah macam modern
so macam um I don't know eh
eh amorino yang mana satu seh
yes yes I remember amorino was the one where they shape the ice cream macam bunga like that macam the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but macam tak memorable sangat ah
uh oh it's a tough one err macam mana eh err
tak I'm sure you like my messina better right
pening seh I tengok
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours ah macam
macam there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good ah that's not something that's easily found here
eh but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so macam you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're lapar like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
borong market okay trying to remember
macam it wasn't it wasn't like popular or macam ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet lah basically
like I remember there was one macam
apa eh flavour ni macam some honeycomb thingy right
pisang goreng is it pisang goreng
macam they said that it was pisang muda goreng or something like that
eh eh mana nak dapat ah
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else lah like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie sebelum tu apa
what's dragon's den tak pernah dengar seh
ini macam shark tank ke apa
oh macam like the article like she published or something eh
miss all the good food seh overseas but I miss um ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas macam masak sendiri and all kan
I do I do like macam
apa eh for example prata probably like we would actually
trying to find a prata shop or teh tarik shop and pay an exorbitant amount untuk beli just to macam
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then kan ya tu ah
entah ah maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than kat sini
kau singapore pun ada seh
what was so nice about it ah was it like the spices or apa apa yang sedap sangat ah
livable boy sama makan sama hidup eh
sedap kan like apa eh what do we have shepherd's pie ah
and then um ya like we shared quite a bit ah we went there I think malam eh
tu ah tak ingat ah
wah rindu gila seh
um let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes kat
sedap kan like
like like I didn't even know something macam so basic and simple can taste so sedap you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait apa what was the filling dalam jacket potato dia lupa ah
ya macam I don't think it was tuna what was it ah just like sour cream eh it was ya something like really simple but remember kita order lepas tu kita order lagi lepas tu ya it was that good ah
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said ah before the freshness of the produce and macam ya things are just
so many things to miss about being overseas apa lah yang kita boleh buat kat singapore sekarang
ya lah that one standard ah standby duit jer
macam ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money lah but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores pasal dia orang suka touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience err like it's over there it's like
yang unbeatable lah and ya you I think
it's not just one brand tapi macam berlambak ah brand
bukan bicester
okay can you jog my memory again york mana satu
okay lah just want to check it out while we are there betul aqilah
so right what eh did we go to any theme parks ah kat sana like I can't remember like during our trip
ya only only that one err that one place ingat tak tempat tu apa tu nama dia
yang ada the one with the that float what do you call it ah
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope apa eh what is it called ah
ya but basically there was that fun huge float kita duduk kat dalam lepas tu we just slide down the slope ya get it is it
ya that was nice and then that was this um eh mahal eh
berapa ah berapa seh
I think kita ada masuk macam some maze thingy right
not not rafting ah lupa ah
oh then kita ada masuk tu haunted house haunted house
kan ada macam tempat I don't know there was this like towards the end of our trip dekat sana then ada this little like haunted house yang kita masuk
kat atas ah like this house of mirrors or something like that

ya it can layer on lagi eh kat dalam forests kena layer on seh
bila seh how come I don't know
ni time uni eh
but err tu ah like last time I never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like I am sure you had to save up to do certain thing I mean macam you've got to plan around your budget and everything kan
jauh gila eh
eh sabar belgium is germany right
oh okay okay and then apa jadi
so wait the cab fare was mahal gila or what
ish rabak or what

wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys dah takde duit apa seh
oh faham faham K K and then
did the taxi driver actually buy your alasan
ah so like he kena switched on dia punya meter ah
okay okay no lah because I'm just wondering macam you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
confirm tengah panic eh pasal macam dah lah lambat then you have to find your gate and everything like oh my goodness
macam macam what what would err the like significant moments of the trip
oh selamat ah spain menang
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like habis
people will probably be like maki-maki semua
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm ah kena jalan balik kan
serious eh roti and tuna everyday okay I don't think I can do that

then yang majulah singapura pun
macam conductor ah wah I know three step only
dan mari kita three step jer dia itu
ya so the correct so the third year aku move out err then I was uh staying dekat my aunty's punya place lah so what happens is uh I was there uh for actually aku duduk kat rumah dia kan for very long it's about
uh I they gave me hints lah ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed dekat dia orang punya place for one and a half years ya one and a half years err my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way err they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then uh that was the the time where aku just uh you know just tried to just tried to to survive lah you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof lah and then I was you know so that was a good thing lah
correct so that was that was err err you know err at the end of the three years then err aku early this this this year ah first of january actually
err sometimes okay terms sometimes tak okay lah so that means macam um kadang-kadang she will invite me back tau macam um you know to to her to the family home lah but uh sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
um she totally changed bukan change macam apa ah so she totally macam uh you know she she's more err she she literally like uh tries to bother about what I'm doing you know uh getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there tapi uh aku rasa she I don't know whether she realise lah that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing lah so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me lah now err but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months eh we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
yes yes yes rimas rimas is the correct word yes yes I agree I agree
I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time ah whenever it I'm the same as you ah mesti kalau macam cakap kan mesti nak menang tau macam in an argument eh kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang so I'm always macam energetically fight back tau ah passionate macam fight back tau but nowadays kan macam I I don't know ah kenapa it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through uh certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so uh kita macam tak tak uh apa tu there's no more energy to to ah to to expand to to argue tau macam at the most pun kalau even if we don't agree kan nanti the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer lah you know it's just you know you just you just stop lah just you just don't don't don't speak lah but but it's something that I have always um like macam I I'm really thankful that um she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because err I I knew back then eh I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay lah you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because err dia pergi haji uh last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that uh she came back and err I think I don't know lah maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno tak yang the coklat Kinder Bueno okay okay I I tell you what's the relation eh Kinder Bueno dia punya chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it is it is that is that oh for me for me I can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart kan I will I will ah I will be very very uh macam adamant to to keep to my belief style ah so when when I and when I'm that kind eh you that no matter what you do right I will not change and I will not follow whatever you say I will just keep to my own ini but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing uh I will I will melt I will melt and I will just give in tau
so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience lah ya and then apa
I actually find them funny lah it's just like the way they walk lah aku tak boleh dok aku aku kalau tengok dia orang jalan macam gitu kan every time aku tengok like macam it's like eh it's like eh bro your one very big ah bro ya
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for punya apa tu uh yang yang yang ni apa we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was uh the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time kan so you ask me to apply for punya apa tu uh opening kan yang yang ala air steward
ya err I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about uh I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like eh come lah just just follow me lah you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat northpoint kat yishun
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area dekat northpoint dekat McDonald's and then kat luar and then we were talking about things like illuminati lah we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right um the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective tau which which means okay macam let's say for example eh I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand tau kenapa dia macam gitu
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so err and and and it was honestly right my mind ah is always a one track thing so let's say for example kan aku cakap okay I told myself ah I I want to become a pilot but err I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing lah so I I don't have that kind of err presence of mind ah to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
so so my my life in in this industry lah in this aviation industry started out with um with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room uh on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion lah because he wanted to become a pilot himself tapi dia punya eyesight err macam tak err how to say eh uh not hundred percent lah not not not not a six six lah vision lah so uh and at that time kan dia orang very strict kan kalau kau punya eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance dia lain ah ah tau yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right sebab tu eh they realise eh in err in err eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so dia orang uh they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot tau who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because dah tak boleh apa because you dah pakai you dah pakai glasses then that's that's it lah you you no more already lah no more chance right so ah so that was what spurt on my motivation uh and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in uh so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to err err start the flying course ah so that time uh they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents uh fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight macam familiarisation flight ah so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out lah dekat err kita pergi sana then after that apa tu they they brief us and then err they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that lah this was a very long time ago sekarang dah takde lagi tau
sekarang ah sekarang is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition uh even further because I felt you know ah bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight dekat youth flying club tau and this was when I was sixteen lah when I was up there it was such a different feeling
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet lah bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing lah that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that lah ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could tapi aku I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics macam science ah science punya subject kan err I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
uh it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time ah I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my uh my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so uh puzzled because did cakap apa tau
uh eh I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics ah but your other topics ah you rabak man you cannot make it why ah then I realise that but it was it was uh uh only way way way later lah then I realise that uh okay I I I actually
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally aku tak boleh bergerak I was just I I and I still remember that day was my uh examination my english paper punya examination and err I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now ah okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it recurred again ya it recurred again so uh that was another dent in my in my in my dreams lah basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know aku pergi ah punya air steward punya interview tu yang aku pass
err actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why aku tak aku tak dapat uh jadi err air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up lah how it all times ties back together
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation aku pakai ni aku pakai my medisave uh my my apa tu orang panggil
uh I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid uh pakai insurance ah macam my medical insurance ah ya err for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
apa working
ada ada sikit uh my mortgage kan every month is uh one point one K uh aku punya err they cut off aku punya uh eight hundred
so aku kena top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future lah aku aku aku I was thinking lah anyway that one is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me lah which is why I wanted a bigger place uh the other reason was because aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang ah all my baggage my
eh I don't mind man I really don't mind kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat it's just beside admiralty jer also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area kan and uh the it's only about macam five minutes
tak tak tak tak it's not it's uh it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential punya punya place ah
yes I was there uh okay lah it was it was uh it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is um when you are overseas eh err your how do I put it eh you you're considered as an expat tau so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration lah so that's the reason why um most of us kan kita belajar kat sana we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to uh apply with the local punya okay so right now right now err so okay so so right now what happens is this eh
so uh average lah it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level lah I'm not I'm not a macam senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of uh about four K about there lah about about uh thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed kita dah sign contract kita dah sign dok we even we even err graduated kita semua dah celebrate seh we went out drinking I mean
ah tak tak tak tak tak I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks lah along the way there's you know there's ujian there's setbacks there's uh
ya I know right macam nasib kentang kan macam there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before lah this phrase I know I know
tapi I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining lah you know in in every ya so aku I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to uh goes back on track and all that right uh I I'm pretty sure lah one day lah one day I uh you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it lah
eh it's a different skill set lah sia it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself uh being on the drone so when I see it I was like oh okay ya lah but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do uh uh that's relatable and that's uh you know but I think uh they they have already announced macam plans lah you know
uh they want to push us to become uh flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is uh back to normal again right uh I think you know hopefully lah hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old aku tak boleh ah dok flight tak boleh
yes yes actually you are right you are right I I agree tapi dia dia punya orang he's not a war err what you call it eh he's not those ya he's a very selfish businessman but he's not the type of war mongering you know guy that that
exactly you know he's very divisive lah dia punya talking eh dia punya words eh that he say uh selalu make people uh fight each other
ya but dia punya orang macam tak um dia punya words ah he's words are very unwise and also no wisdom lah I I find that he's very different from obama obama eh when he speaks eh dia punya cakap eh all his words eh um they are very substance tau they have a lot of substance
macam their their their thoughts lah
eh kau ada citizenship eh new zealand uh huh
ya bro that's why you need to bring the entertainment to you that means your home right will be your one stop entertainment okay eh but new zealand mahal ke eh tak mahal kan dia punya standard of living huh
ya but I but no aku rasa it's not that much of uh how do you put it eh macam I I don't know what the currency is like uh the standard of living and the cost of living over there over there but from what I'm seeing eh it seems that everybody is okay leh dia orang macam tak
but the house is not fully paid for macam mana
cannot travel maknanya dia orang
kalau okay let's say macam for example eh kalau nak pergi ah okay ah cannot means the custom cannot clear them
nak kena macam uh in in a advance ah inform them in advance kind of thing ah
asal eh
tapi if you will just the duit bunga kan dia orang panggil duit bunga eh but you you still accumulate apa
correct twenty four per cent dia orang ambil kan they call it apa ah
I definitely eat rendang
rendang actually that's a good question why tau because
I selalu makan rendang
hari raya but then mak mak
mak always masak like anytime she wants
so when she everytime masak I everytime makan and I love the taste of rendang
so I makan everyday ah
dua bulan makan rendang straight
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe petang makan with roti then malam makan dengan noodle
ya lah ketupat is the best lah definitely
you put serunding oof
actually kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan noodles and like
you had lemak cili api pasta
sedap je lah cakap
sendu lain lah
macam step know it all ah
kirakan the big shot ah
people yang ego
so macam
I just can't stand kalau orang nak macam nak step besar ah nak step orang yang nak step I really just cannot
kirakan dia champion ah kirakan dia champion
more better lebih baik
then hidup tak ada objective
tak ada makna ya because for example if someone
work in terms of because orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu
ya so macam
ah so macam buang masa ah hidup
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed banyak banyak industry he dah masuk he fail banyak
and then after the dia dah buat the apprenticeship dengan tattoo artist dia buka kedai dia sendiri
at forty five and kedai dia successful
you rasa you
dah puas with the thing you buat kan
if not sampai bila bila pun kan you tak akan
dapat that this is the life that I want
all that thing yang you dah explore remain inside your body
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff kan you know I did all traditional stuff
and susah untuk kita nak
that society punya ape tu what do you call it requirement
yeah you go first ah I tak tahu apa nak
because melayu always masak with agak agak
so it's nice when it's agak agak
I want the rendang italian
mana-mana ah
my most memorable meal was your macaroni goreng
your macaroni goreng
and we ate dekat stadium
dekat lantai because we like we just that time I think that was the first few dates that we had kan
like you just cook macaroni goreng for me and then kita duduk dekat
right dekat stadium punya entrance
and then we just sat there and people were like taking bicycle around lari lah apa lah buat exercise lah
we wanted to go kallang wave mall and lepak dekat waterfront punya tempat tu
zaman bila kita pergi ice-skating
I tak ingat lah
I tak ingat
I think so eh no kallang wave mana ada movie
ni hundred need to lookout ya you can see it it's gonna be huge
imagine you get you a hundred lipas ee
yeah yeah kan I cakap
rendang because that's what I deserve
so so you rejected my rendang answer but you gave me kari ayam
apa sia get ignorance
all my punya members lah and even my friends
they say when I masuk dalam bilik
makan oho
if I nak pilih satu eh
you pilih dulu ah I think I know yours
yes please there's another outlet kan
I thought dah buka
somewhere in the west eh or center I tak ingat I know it's not in the east
a'ah seh sedap seh itu
muak because of the cheese dalam dia punya daging
sekarang nak masuk airport leceh ah
buat lawak eh
you doa lah I got car
try kalau pergi changi airport parah baby
because changi airport punya car park kan
so kalau kita gi Shake Shack boleh makan kasi habis five minute okay ah
yours is yellow kan
apa good energy
apa superpower itu
I would say the power to control my kentut without having stomachache
orang nampak me
you know what's a death note kan
which avatar yang botak ke yang biru
oh yang botak eh
tak ada tak ada backup on that statement just because dia budak botak you tak suka
dia macam Ipin with power
badang stuff
ya then then I tak gi mana mana ah
you tak keluar eh
you tak keluar jugak eh
I thought you say you dah catch up already
tomorrow confirm if keluar ramai orang seh
dia makan taugeh macam makan keropok
after she wash right while she's cooking and waiting for the other things to siap right she just take the taugeh and put inside her mouth like is potato chip
rosak eh the lidah
that time yang you buat kan
but that one the dashyat
dia dashyat gila punya lah masin
percussion tu main music
if you minum Boost you kenyang
so you minum Boost yang besar punya that time I always like drink Boost for my dinner
in the morning I eat all the normal normal stuff then malam I just like
sebat Boost jer
macam waste of money
iphone eleven dalam one thousand plus ah
so if kalau tambah plus atau yang eh sorry iphone pro eh iphone pro dengan iphone pro max
yang tu kena check dulu like dia punya harga berapa
oh so I think tengok tempat dia plan jer lah tengok macam mana dia punya plan dia berapa gigabyte
berapa incoming call free semua like
dia punya specs ah
hmm tengok benefit benefit dia
but currently you use what phone currently pakai phone apa
ya ya our saudara
alamak drill ah buto sorry sorry pause
yang iphone eleven tu uh you plan to take which plan
tu full price ah no contract ah
oh actually iphone seven also not bad tapi I I would suggest iphone eight ah because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone ah
I think tu paling terbaik lah kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan iphone eleven is really good enough ah
ya so that one that time was during COVID kan so sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab
iya lah sebab COVID kan so not to get more consumer to buy the phone lah at a cheaper price ya
even ah android phone pun sama lah like google the new google apa pixel kan they they make it cheaper lah but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit kurang lah compared to the previous one ya
must check the new iphone right jap eh let me check eh
it has a better bionic chip the apa it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
ya they are still selling I mean um you must check you must check takpe ah ustaz tengah check
takpe ah ustaz kena check dia punya iphone punya iphone store
iphone X eh iphone X jap jap jap there's a face iphone
oh our ni eh parents eh
I think biasa ah mum is sleeping then I think bapak baru balik ya and
ah bapak kerja ah dekat ni lah iya dia kerja ni lah hari ni kerja pe hari ni hari rabu kan
tak lah I think he working three times a week
tu I think paling penting ah so like macam nanti um once I've started working
kalau tak nanti macam before this kerja macam tak prepare sangat setakat apa
macam relax relax tapi nanti end up macam tak belajar apa-apa macam cause
apa start started working kan you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing kan so you need to
for coding ah ya so basically it's not that hard lah because really we can just uh search up in the in the apa
ya ya some some some apa some company kan they
they know ah whether you you've you search online ke tak lah cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important ah it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice ah you need to really improve on it ah then you have higher chance to to be apa to be offered lah by the company
jangan kena pijak ah gitu
tapi like looking into like contract or apa
uh full time ke part time
tapi kalau full time pun there's a lot of expectation kan macam
tapi N level start sama time eh dengan O level
tapi ah the
ya tapi the condition sekarang condition sekarang macam mana dia punya COVID dia orang ambil O level december apa this COVID kat
but dia orang ambil same timing dia orang ada own shift ke apa atau it's just one time
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically ah system engineer lah you are looking to that position atau you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of dia punya ni lah
software engineer ke if
macam mana nak spell F O R T L A N
apa skills ah like
for example apa eh okay name like
I think it's like flutter dia ada own language which which covered dart eh dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is apa go golang eh golang
like owned by google ah so they they have their own language they make their own ni designed by them
yang tengah ah siapa yang tekan biasanya the manager kan the apa uh the business punya side the project manager dia orang akan tekan kan this apa
but each country like they have their own server ke atau they have their own
means like singapore have one server so lain negeri ada their own server ke
atau combine macam asia
abeh sekarang like ah
you know macam COVID pun is getting better kan singapore
malaysia pun like they they do open the border kan to singapore kan macam only for those yang business
ah green lane semua
so for the purpose of those yang ada rumah kat sana kan dia orang boleh ya for us I think we can't ah sebab we are going there basically nak apa
nak cuti kan
actually boleh balik ah because technically she is ni kan she is not singaporean kan
actually I'm not sure like our cousin yang always uh who are staying there kan who are staying there syakilah iman do they dia orang boleh datang sini ke
unless dia orang ada they ada kerja dekat sini lah dia orang ada kerja kan atau rumah kat sini kan
the malaysia people ah the ah all our saudara kat sana
oh cik rozi lama tak call eh
alhamdulilah dah makan dah I think
mum cook apa kari ayam so we just ate tu lah we just ate the
kuah apa kari ah kuah kari and I just cook telur sikit then makan
tapi tu lah
ah that one the smell nanti apa
iya lah bau dia kan nanti tu kan nanti iya lah tutup tingkap
but I know ah I know how to cook macam like simple simple ah like usually I cook thai food ah sweet and sour fish
and kai lan ikan masin
baby kai lan ikan masin so macam setakat ikut ni ah ikut youtube and
ya kadang-kadang beli kat ni fairprice
giant so just beli apa
barang-barang semua dekat ni ah barang-barang kat giant and fairprice
kalau ada takde ah just find a replacement ah macam
that time takde ikan apa eh ikan tenggiri ke apa eh
so uh I replaced it with ikan apa nama dia
tak tahu ah nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin ah macam ketul-ketul macam cube ikan cube
simple lah dia punya masak it's not that hard ah just ikut dia punya youtube punya tutorial
ah boneless and dia macam I think it's dried ah dried food dried fish
ya macam you you macam very dried lah dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat
ya so macam like it's in terms in the form of cube ah cube then with that cube just ah letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu
once the the fish dah tu kan
dah lembut ah baru tu lah pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak baby kai lan
letak kicap oyster sauce so once dah
dah panaskan I think like
five to ten minutes dah siap
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome ah kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa make sure letak dengan tepung ah tapi dia punya sauce senang nak buat ah sweet and sour sauce
tapi tu lah I think this is like the starting point ah cuma macam nak I think I took me awhile ah like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring macam you need to macam
potong ni lah
ya true ah barang-barang dah siap if someone already did that for me kan senang ah I think my life will be easier
cuma itulah you need
tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada agreement dia is just one house kan the maid
the agreement biasanya one maid macam
jaga one house kan
iya lah iya lah of course
ah iya lah
pause jap eh pause jap
but if the maid macam they have their own tu kan kerja timing dia kan
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day kan except malam ah kan
dah berumur ya
mmhmm betul
ada lah dekat fairprice fairprice fairprice punya online
ada lah sometimes I think
that time I saw like macam halal punya daging kan
ya really ni lah dia punya which section eh the section yang ada frozen food
actually I saw this youtube video ah very interesting dia macam punya shopping
tapi I don't think singapore ada ah dia macam like I think in america ke apa ah which country atau china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop kan there'll be someone who welcome you pastu ah you using the lah I think it's a like the device ah you need to buy the device device
if if memang ya stock finish of course the thing is empty lah dia punya ni ah
tapi it's very hard ah like I mean the software wise like
iya lah iya lah
of course ah dia punya price mahalnya it's like you're playing four punya punya tu kan console
but I think can be solved ah like technology wise macam they keep changing kan most like it's probably ah I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change ah macam in terms of like the new normal
like dulu takde kan I think previously my company my former company dia pernah offer ah work from anywhere so one year macam they give like seven days ah
kat rumah lah you can can stay at home or go overseas apa
ah ya lah as long as you do something lah usually the manager will ni lah the
you need to be apa
ah ya lah my company former company use zoom for ni lah
macam container ah nak letak something container like small one ah ya but I think ah
tak tahu ah hari tu my friend tanya nak pergi ikea ke tak dia ajak
ya they they limit ni lah the number of ah customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure berapa ah
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those yang one person kan they will sit at the seat of four kan nanti macam they don't apa utilise the space ah they don't make use of the space
then end up macam the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time lah kalau weekend kan in tampines kan
ya the queue selalu panjang
nak control eh ya ya
ya betul
oh iya lah iya lah
ya I think it's a bit tu lah a bit
it's a bit scary ah kalau if
ada orang break the rule apa kan
like actually you say you heard places yang some
apa dia orang kena ni kan kena warning kan because of this thing kan
like the customer tak ikut ni
ya lah you see like in at apa shopping mall like it's those crowded kan nowadays macam susah nak control ah
ya I think they will just monitor lah this apa maybe there's someone
watching the ke apa kan they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor yang
macam detect
check out lah don't check out lah ya it's very difficult to ni
about I think regarding the the battery lah dia cepat habis ah
like the the nearby devices kan siapa yang
um google and apple kan to ni with the android dengan phone
or you still stick with ni
I think this is still depends cause google home kan they detect ni kan the surrounding kan
as long as jauh ah microphone dengan I mean dia punya google home kan ada microphone kan
I'm not too sure ah like like what will be the reply like ah macam default like
ya maybe ah maybe ya ya the default punya default
oh iya lah iya lah ada offline data lah persistent storage ah
maybe you can try like alexa ke
tapi but then it just think of us like their lagipun singapore is moving into smart nation kan so at certain points at certain ah zone for example I think punggol ke sengkang eh
like punggol kan there's there's a lot of flat kan so I think these flats dia orang ada their own smart punya apa devices ah macam ah smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart lah basically so bila macam masuk bilik
for example smart light you enter a room kan nanti dia macam the intensity akan increase ah
as we walk into macam tu example jer lah
so tak payah tekan butang ke apa
I think they have ah macam
ya macam ada sensor kan
ah iya lah iya lah
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country kan dia kat india eh
ya there's some country use that ah macam pedal ke apa
I think in singapore ada some building kan dia macam like if inside the lift takde button
only kat luar jer
those abilities like macam
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours macam you cakap you want to be superman atau pun nak jadi
oh bat sorry batman or iron man okay kau nak jadi batman or iron man I would also want a superpower yang
mm dia bukan dia bukan specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
ah so for me oh ya teleporting eh didn't actually come across my mind until tadi sebut teleporting
any place of the world you tau macam harry potter
err magic spell I forgot lah apa magic spell ah
mm ah disapparate ah dia orang disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age ah
goblet of fire cedric diggory yang ada siapa tu yang handsome tu nama dia ah
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like macam switch on and off
budak-budak kan
for me to macam tahu what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I do not want macam to be burdened
ah boleh on and off ah gitu
the thing is on and off lah I think every superpower ada burdensome
telepathy ah eh sorry apa
it depends lah whether you have more time the thing is people I think people nak this
duit definitely okay
okay apa
superpower macam okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe ah
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or jaga or apa
budak nangis datang kasi peluk to orang besar kan macam nothing ah tapi
in the mata like macam orh
but what if naik lemak
like they dia orang tak nak
they just expect to be given eh dia ni rich apa so tak payah lah work hard so we just wait for him apa to durian runtuh
unlimited duit
it's something that you think of lah but I to me I think you know me as a person kan I'm not a person that wants unlimited duit
with unlimited duit
because ah okay the thing is something there macam
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that apa I respect it's just that I'm just
since you were saying superpower apa ni your superpower of unlimited duit
if there's if that's if there is someone kan macam
ubat for COVID nineteen like the perfect ubat
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study belajar macam mana like
like macam
free only untuk
K the thing is I think kan kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni kan
probably free depending on what type of ubat
err like singapore singapore doesn't give macam a lot of things percuma free
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone betul tak
apa you your superpower that you wanted was
unlimited duit
knowledge you pun macam meh uh macam gitu lah
dengan my personality lah
or do you want to give me a superhero that macam sama dengan I wonder woman
wonder woman is just macam too feminist ah
about wonder woman agaknya macam most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie kekasih dia
ya lambat gila lah sampai kekasih dia
she had to watch her kekasih die
I think they will filming ah lepas tu dia orang stop pasal COVID nineteen kan
oh dah habis filem dengan production eh
oh because of COVID nineteen then tak boleh ramai-ramai tengok oh
eh why not kan dia orang macam
macam okay Netflix is a one time payment uh tapi kalau nak tengok movie movie ni
movie baru
atau pun movie lama-lama
Netflix bayar per month lah because we are using we are sharing accounts right so
untuk for us saje lah but I'm not too sure how much but
this production macam
so macam mana dia orang buat duit
ah those movie yang exclusive
dalam Netflix ya
ya lah monthly subscription which is berapa jer
okay pasal bapa sponsor ni I know too well pasal I watch korean dramas kadang-kadang dia punya sponsor macam over sangat

bila tengok movie ke tengok drama macam gitu ah
lupa pula apa initial question tadi eh

batman macam ego ah gitu
ah tu lah pasal that time you ada bilang I yang batman ada different different type of batman kan satu batman cakap okay untuk bunuh orang satu batman cakap tak okay untuk bunuh orang ah tu banyak personality lah
kalau burdensome is like
macam cakap ego I told that the batman ego pasal
dia fikir dia boleh bunuh orang ah pasal dia
sebab tu dia tahu oh dia ni boleh mati dia ni tak boleh mati dia ni tak boleh mati

kerja keras saje lah
takpe lah malas nak apa fikir-fikir
no macam that one is the syarahan type lah then we have to I have to change thinking already then we cannot say about superheroes
so kita ada dalam
satu minute
harus actually bottom line is just to kerja keras lah
itu lah simple lah eh
ini bukan syarahan lah
tu macam bagus eh
cerita kami ni eh
okay ada lagi lima saat empat saat
abang kita kena buat recording untuk survey ni kan
oh okay okay can can boleh boleh
um kena berbual pasal apa though like what we
ya I mean movie also boleh and
say that time err me and abang afal pergi tengok movie dekat cinema movie apa
ah your eyes tell dia punya movie is pasal is a ah japanese movie lah so kita dia punya cerita sedih gila
I don't know I was just like tengah nangis-nangis rabak lah but then the cerita is about like satu perempuan ni dah macam dia buta temporarily
ya like tak buta mata lah because like he she was like she got into an accident
and like lepas tu like
macam dekat part of the story was like the guy that dia suka or like macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta kan
it's actually it was was one of the reason why dia buta
ya ah because of like when he got when she got into an accident the lelaki tu macam buat benda yang like
tak tak supposed to buat lah because you know you know
ah then after that like it lead her to macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu
then yang paling sedih part is actually like bila
err perempuan tu kena undergo surgery kan pasal boleh actually boleh like rawat lah like boleh get better so that guy pasal that guy macam very poor tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam you know
kerja cara wrestling semua so kerja untuk like because they macam ah couple what
so like that guy macam ah dia
kerja sampai dapat duit untuk undergo for that girl to undergo surgery ah
then after and then after that bila like uh
ya so because of that rant dia bagi like duit to undergo surgery then when the surgery tu was successful
dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu lah because he doesn't want to like
and after that yang part sedih was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
dia macam contact later like contemplating whether he should jumpa perempuan tu balik or like
tinggalkan so bila part like
bila part dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena stabbed
from like this like bad people because dia dulu kerja memang jahat
then after that dia kena coma for two years ah
lelaki tu kena coma for two years and after that he was in like this like care hospital macam orang jaga then that girl was one of the volunteer
you know the thing is like bila coma so he cannot talk what
ah that's japanese punya movie lah but then bila like sekarang hospital tu then the guy was like the the guy saw the girl but he cannot say anything then he was crying so bad then perempuan tu macam
apa ni like
then like he alleged actually before that he also macam buat sculpture
ceramic so he before that macam when dia buta he she felt the lelaki muka ah
so and then after that uh I think macam there was one this music box yang reminded of both of them
one of the pekerja kata dengan perempuan tu yang there's this guy who came in the
crying while listening to music box terus dia tahu ah that was like the last part terus dia tahu yang
apa it was the guy that
ya but then the only reason why she wanted to undergo the surgery was because the guy kata um you don't want to see like our home together our future together our child together then the part damn sad ah sedih gila and after that ya me and abang was like tengah teared out already then the whole cinema tengah nangis gila kelakar gila seh
no I mean like if I explain all obviously like it doesn't really make sense lah but then if you tengok the trailer is already so sad ya that's like the the movie yang like made me cry so bad
in a cinema like never in my life I cry so bad but I cried so bad there then even my abang was like are you crazy
kat netflix kan
how many seasons ada though
eh banyak
wah it's like macam the
dia pada like when he was like a'ah
dia semua ingat dia orang macam like weird
who are this semua nak
kahwin semua and like a lot of people look down on him lah
oh ah betul betul
serious ah ah so like betul betul just like awkward lah
ah tak boleh just
just like kahwin terus lah dia dia straight
but like to me like nowadays I don't I'm not that interested in those like mat salleh
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and kakak and abang also like watch everyday like at the
eh but then like thankfully like ibu and bapa is like
that time I came back home then lepas tu ah ibu was like um
what is what is that like at your drawer so berlambak album then I'm like what am I supposed to say I thought she was going to scold me then I I was like ah tu album ah then she was like ah duit birthday semua pakai
pakai beli album jer
no because tak no because just like that album is like very cheap
I I beli like I bought there was like
a few only then I'm like I mean okay lah it's not that expensive so ni lah I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits dekat
dekat somerset
it's like bingsoo then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe dekat dengan
ya and to me like those type of cafes I actually expected to like lebih mahal
start a cafe but I know that in singapore is like very mahal like like you want to the rent all is like it's not cheap
a'ah then kau kalau also need to promote then what if like orang don't want to come so
tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap then that was the problem fit in the cafe
ah they just go there to take picture ambil gambar aesthetic the environment elements
that's why I go that's why I go eighty two punya ni like
tapi macam merepek ah like I don't know like just tak suka it's just like
macam baru ah dah tak suka like that
macam like apa-apa pun
tak boleh kaya kenapa tak boleh kaya aladdin is what
tak fun that was the point ah dia semua dapat duit then ni
no but the thing is like the thing about me is also like I don't know know where I'm going next in the future also so I don't have a specific thing like I nak buat
in the future I don't know what I want to be I don't know what I want to like what I'm interested in and all so macam like err kadangkala also macam keliru like I know what to do so macam I guess I want to find like something that
because I feel like I I like to try like a lot of things so macam
when you like to try a lot of things you don't really know like apa exactly like you nak buat in life to me I guess that's like the problem I'm having right now
tak banyak lah
mm banyak like ada banyak choice you can
buat lah
penat ah penat
so macam it will like macam ada like things like in the way
tapi sekarang also like
money like duit is very important
and also macam
some like especially sekarang like during COVID

what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game aku punya bingit which man U game the one with crystal palace ah
K K K admittedly macam macam budak-budak ah macam main dengan boy look look at look at wilfried freaking zaha what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
geram seh then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about gareth bale and sergio aguero and and thiago
but oh look dia pun sign the only work
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database pakai football manager semak
david moyes kat mana dia baru lawan arteta last week
eh but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna angkat again ah the korang punya the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular thiago
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the barcelona against inter milan punya game ah barcelona ah eh sorry um
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't van gaal doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone yang terus shoot the ball tau
ah basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to kelam kabut he lose the ball there
ya but klopp he he demands the intensity and that kelam kabut
oh sun sun sun sun sun sun sun ah whatever lah melayu swan melayu
bro I have not been playing in that long for a long time aku main best twenty one ah sekarang eh best twenty twenty

robert pattison I cannot bayang that man after that glittery shit show on
so you are talking about macam child molesting kind of
okay talking about children aku baru berbual dengan bini aku a few days ago okay I I don't subscribe to Netflix cause I have an app which can get all netflix movies or shows for free

quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing ah and kau kau tahu the controversy behind it
this de-sexualisation of minors kan selalunya I would say kan syaiton slowly syaiton is slowly inserting his influence on these things ah

aku nak tahu ni who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through budak-budak sebelas tahun macam
he's he plays like nerdy character macam he himself looks like
a'ah sia eh makin is it okay when back in korang ada dengar rumours
one of my junior in and err budak he err lieutenant in the army when I when I came in through when I was in he was already a lieutenant
he went after then ah and he okay dia dia
dia macam apa tau he's the eager to please ah
I can imagine him kalau dalam eh if you take a platoon in their time
he's one of those who first to volunteer first to it very on the ball nak good kid
very quiet ah dengar cakap
always does his best and high flyer in terms of academics and not a bit so dia physically small but willing to push himself
when I was a recruit in the army kat canteen and and dekat cookhouse and he's a lieutenant there he saw me then he
pause for moment and he's dia gagap tau dia macam err err where he almost called me sir
setahun jer ah ah but you know I retain one year that kind of thing so
his face came out in the news lah surat khabar aku baca straits times I not sure whether he did it or not lah I mean if he go by islamic standards I have to verify
did dia nya he put in the dark net or something
orang kita ah
ah favour ah kau forward pada aku kat WhatsApp
and the thing is what I find important is the prinsip behind the marriage tau pasal back in our ancestors punya time dorang
it's not just a matter of it's a matter of prinsip and honour as well tau macam you don't marry for love you marry first and you make the relationship work the love will come later
they he determines the man is suitable then meminang
perlu ah

ya I will let let benda ni semua kalau aku dapat menantu macam dia kau nak carikan aku carikan aku macam dia
scary eh aku macam

I don't know I feel for my daughter tau macam takut ah what will happen to society that point in time what she has to go through and kalau dia di apa-apa kan or something ah then
you making jokes ah and then dia some say something I was commenting his team about makeup then she gave me a glare tau dia cakap

dia kata we we're not fulfilling anybody's expectations only ours bro eh lady you you're at you're fulfilling expectations of big makeup pharmaceutical company is really you they are the ones
you not conforming to expectations relax sua minah confirm kau you can live within your own bubble without looking at the bigger picture and as long as what makes you happy ah

you will draw the line at games right it's talking about Netflix aje ah I I've been
aku have been caught in watching
so ah kita have been watching this first show which actually was an old show ah it's called breaking bad
eh but better call saul to me is better correct better dia punya jalan cerita lama asal
tak cause you have not
correct ah but but better call saul is ongoing dia belum habis
ah I think season one season two you still ah dekat ah jimmy jimmy ya but kau belum nampak dia punya character development whereby he has his moral dilemmas
he's not wrong per se which is not legally wrong tapi is
aku rasa three ah three three to four ah then um
then you see how brothers three each other and everything ah so kau dah tengok dia punya abang treat dia macam mana
okay okay so you kau dah tengok part yang dia bastard adik dia ah
he basically tore his brother down to shreds and his brother will macam lookout to him as this ideal brother figure in his illusion
the brother mati ke belum
okay better call saul dah sampai season six eh
but then now not not okay now while while I'm waiting for better call saul to restart aku tengok aku follow up with apa tau with ah
another old show aku tak tahu eh I I've seen this old shows on Facebook orang comment donkey years back I still remember the show tapi aku tak truly realise aku watch
every every season except for season eight witcher aku tak boleh witcher aku try tapi macam aku tak live up no but after that I watch prison break

ah aku waiting for better call saul to start a new one then aku already watch breaking bad all these I watch in the last two months sia bro
oh ya ya ya right right now starting starting ah aku memang suka baca ah but starting last week
baik sia it's a british show it's it's a good change from the american latino gangster thing ah
okay pasal aku aku
no no no how I do my safe entry basically kalau let's say somewhere which I go often eh tampines mall
I don't close I don't ever close that browser so the next time I come ah use that same old from maybe last week or something aku malas sia nak scan scan balik ya ya I breaking protocols here but ya that's how I do it
A level O level semua keluar a'ah okay
okay ah so boleh ah
but apa double tap terus masuk camera mode apa
code keluar the camera app ah
aku press camera app I point it at the code
a'ah so why double tap can just masuk the app then
tu ah I was thinking apa macam sial ah aku tengok is that a code jadi code to your address or
so what's the ayat
so the start of the ayat start at the bottom
I I see what you did that you got ayatul kursi on
give me a good few suggestions eh ah my dad told me there's this good place dekat somewhere near the mushroom park opposite mushroom park
ah it's not at mushroom park tau mushroom park is old chang kee punya run is it's a cafe run by old chang kee but it's apparently across err
I know it's across mushroom park atau across the stadium
anchorvale nya
a'ah it's cheap but you can't get anymore melayu then that ah eh
wait so it it's not a good name cause there's no place to lepak or it's not a good name cause there's no corner for you to lepak
it's like the conundrum you how do you confused a mat you ask him you know put in a round room and ask me to lepak one corner
oh the cross across the simpang ini kan ya correct correct correct
err this kind of thing you have to macam mak bapa ah then sometimes they will advise biasa ah macam orang tua they have their preferred um preferred kadi of choice macam they dorang have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer tak ah kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi ah lembut cara dia berbual that kind of thing lah so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding err you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you err boleh book ah then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of kadi available then all the kadi then they also show like where the kadi lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them lah basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer macam oh takut kadi err they wanted for morning morning wedding kan so dorangnya ceremony for the nikah pagi so dorang tak nak macam kadi takut jam so kalau katakan they wanted to have a eight
um ceremony kan then after that oh nine ceremony then katakan they scared oh if the kadi tinggal pasir ris then my ceremony is in jurong dorang takut kadi datang jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred err they don't have a preferred err kadi sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby ah so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the kadi punya tak
look at the kadi available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of kadi available you just choose ah say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the kadi who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this one you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that dah then you can boleh masuk and book the once your date is available you can go and book lah
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the kadi available
and then after that macam
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the kadi that I want but eventually on that day itself my kadi was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
err for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I err you can ask lina for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit macam tak sabar everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it kadi kadi I think there's only three or four
then everything else is naib kadi ya
ni wali punya thing
I don't think anybody does any kadi reviews last time of course lah ya
mmhmm ya you don't want to you don't want to macam yang draggy draggy until macam kasi trauma that kind of thing kan
mm sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause kadang-kadang macam the orang yang datang tak semua islam
you know kan that's that's one thing that for me also cause macam my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended err nikah ceremony with all the dua and everything with all the ceramah everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them lah
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good kadi but then sometimes you don't want someone who
I think I think the okay when it comes to kadi they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
put yourself in their shoes lah macam dorang
setiap minggu ada nikah to do
they will message you and then he will they usually the kadi will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
why he did that was basically just to macam ingatkan err remind you to bawa your err bawa then documents that you need to bring lah basically and then um some time then err he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp lah he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I um
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say lah then I say tak ah err banyak members dah kahwin then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so macam apa nak cakap and everything all I got it down lah
no need to worry but for some of my friends some kadi will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
ya ke but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script ah err post post nikah ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in err like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to baku ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school macam kau primary school your oral have to be baku kan ya exactly
okay so the initial the initial kadi that we chose um on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague lah basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before lah basically ya ya the kadi before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya um but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the kadi that you want and then set a date with
then turun ah turun err on whichever date that err you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the kadi ah macam oh err tunang saya bapa bukan islam then dia tanya like things of like how what is what's err um lah what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit lah basically ya
I wanted to get the kadi that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one kadi that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that macam
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so macam on the day itself if you need to do then oh semua dah siap
um I would say a lot of people nikah on saturday
a lot of people actually nikah on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate err double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married nikah on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
nak kena faham I mean from their point of view is necessary lah for people to for couples to be macam err ready I mean all these is like err basic rumahtangga punya knowledge ah right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
um civics you know like to for you to understand like oh if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing lah ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of macam very open conversations lah but I find it a waste of time for me personally
is not with the is not you don't interview with your kadi ya you do with with err the the head kadi who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
and the wakil from the bride
as in not not necessarily wakil lah as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought mak ah
I mean like it will be better lah right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought mak so ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether macam
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya err then he banyak soalan juga they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
you don't really you don't have a conversation with kadi until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the kadi
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything kan submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of err the the ustaz is there lah he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things lah I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and lepas tu
I think he asked mak some questions then ask lina some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two kakak there will be asking you macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada marriage prep ni eh err apa for you to go and then you like oh and alamak ni saya bila lah then for me right what happened to me was like dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh sign up ni bagus tau macam very informative and everything lah they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy ah so then after that then they will shut up
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi ah that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all macam a propaganda kind of thing like semua kena pergi you know like kind of thing kena pergi like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word kena you know is like kau kena pergi
ah you know like like cause like typical err like pasar melayu they will like say eh kau kena pergi tau ni
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word kena anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of err islamic laws what for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told alina macam I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage lah I mean to cut down all the cost lah basically like I was telling things things like like dulang it's not compulsory you know things like that then um a lot of the other things lah like red wedding cake lah the kompang lah all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
semua orang duduk kan and semua orang boleh tengok macam oh dia tengah potong cake err
you know but if you have a typical wedding macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan buffet kan dorang jalan ambil makan everything kan a lot of the times my friend potong cake orang kat belakang tak tahu then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple lah some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say oh I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it macam okay aku faham but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know macam if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
ya cause they know I I am degil usually lah when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the dia punya mak andam suka control
mak andam is the the the the bride's err makeup artist lah ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different leh like lina makeup artist makeup jalan mak andam is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife err one of them pakai scarf so the whole day the mak andam there betulkan scarf dia then the other one err what's that called makeup then everything betulkan makeup dia everything kan so
so then the groom's side don't have pak andam err I don't know I think it's called pak andam ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so um the the girl the they they rent the baju kan they rent the baju then they would they kain samping they ask pak andam it's all part of money making process lah
err a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same mak andam
cause people you know like oh ni mak andam aku bagus tau you know your makeup dia baik then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends one then always the same mak andam cause they will try to macam
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that macam aku aku need satu jam nak tukar outfit untuk err pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar makeup dia tukar baju dia one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so katakan all weddings eh
ya whole day so we so basically katakan lepas nikah you plan in your itinerary habis nikah pukul lapan setengah err let's say sebelas setengah your habis nikah sebelas setengah right but then you think is sebelas setengah habis err pukul dua belas tukar baju for the next half I can bet with you sebelas setengah nikah belum habis
ceremony nikah might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar eh dah pukul dua belas
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with orang nak ambil gambar every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing macam semua semua tak pernah I went to any wedding where is macam on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you macam oh eleven O five you come here like no point lah you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad lah you don't you don't macam because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five kita turun bawah eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know mak andam suka macam they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to selit as much time as possible so for example
for me ah I scold my friends mak andam a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing ah cause basically like say for my friend right
dia nikah kat masjid then lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did kat simei yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang to move off they want to move off then after that err I'm supposed to move off at err twelve o'clock so
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen eh no no now is eleven err at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty ke eleven forty five around there
then after that she went err she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the nikah kat masjid is the groom's side
the makan at simei is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum kita nak kena jalan sekarang tau then the groom's mum err tapi pengantin belum makan tau
belum makan eh lepas nikah everything ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan then she said err takpe lah nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga pe
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no kita pengantin makan then I told my friends to go and siapkan the food
she went behind my back again she tell the mak the mak err pengantin both sides eh err tak payah makan eh kita makan kat sana jer eh she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like err err tak tahu awak tanya salam that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how degil and how angry I can get err so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the mak andam cannot say anything lah she cause she want to turn back err she know what I'm gonna say already
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom ah right ah exactly kita dah plan dorang makan apa you want to tell them makan makan ala kadar okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the pengantin table then she sitting down there
tak payah tak payah tak payah like I no lah awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay lah okay lah you know
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty dorang belum start makan tau that in her mind by the time dorang start makan by the time dah gini gini aku tak ada time nak betulkan rambut si dia ni that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible lah you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the macam for me lah as the as the the brides err eh as the best best man I have to macam keep everything running lah ya
ya so those those are the things that for me macam important lah nak kena tahu macam
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be err end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he gi makan prata and everything I told him to go eat prata what ah cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like err suka hati dia nak makan lah he was kat sini ada makan apa eh you are like kau tanya aku kat fort canning mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai prata
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say ah macam you have to also macam recce how much are they charging you for rental lah because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own baju
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her mak andam makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her macam that is all on you
it's not a macam a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that one if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you macam maybe some makeup artists oh this is hundred dollars that one is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are sekali they make you look like a nyonya you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
mm ya but but like I say these kind of thing suruh dewi pergi Instagram go and stalk people lah
ah you can just search makeup artist or mak andam then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check oh wah her makeup very nice ah look very natural and you go see oh it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask dewi to message her alina I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram err for for quotations
ya not necessary mak andam would be worth it if you are planning to rent baju I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they macam oh because it's err package dengan empat baju cause it's err bride and groom tukar dua kali you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of baju
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the baju kurung you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own err western baju for example kan then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this mak andam then she will give you discounts ah that kind of thing lah ya they all have like their full package
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why macam your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to tukar baju from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and mak then that's it lah for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves lah
just to put at the front so when during kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah
orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after orang makan they can go to the park
at the same time you cannot expect people dah makan jalan ah is okay you also cannot expect dah makan jalan lah you know that kind of thing ah eh kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan lah you cannot do that what right
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also oh might as well aku dah datang pukul sebelas might as well aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the nikah all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like wah I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya nikah it started off with nikah alina seated alina seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no kompang or nothing what
mm ya dah habis ambil gambar kita makan ya
the kalau tak nak stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible lah but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was nikah
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like kau nak ambil gambar ni tak ah boleh ah sembarang
boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang ah like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be macam that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you macam he eleven oh eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten nak kena ke bawah eleven fifteen you kita jalan then like
takkan jadi during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take macam you have to tell the makeup oh you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time lah from mak andam we get I get that and everything but the same time macam as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time mah you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on oh this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know dua belas tak boleh ah but anything before that you want to change anything kira for me is like now you can be flexible
and you must also understand macam lepas dah nikah eh nanti ada orang ambil gambar
then nak salam that kind of thing kan and nak orang turun
dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok the tea ceremony
I mean that is considering is still during this period ah I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more lepak ah now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
tak no problem ah no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem lah
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me ah especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now tau macam yang datang members members kau sendiri then macam kalau nak ada bayar I mean you
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just err okay err dia they just ah okay ah keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come gitu gitu just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always macam felt that
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like eh kau buat apa I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee lah I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
you know the emcee who likes to takeover macam oh okay sekarang groom awak jumpa dia macam mana you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
ya I don't find it necessary lah I mean unless you what you will have a macam
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different lah but tak tak macam buang duit ah
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their mak andam and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche macam oh semua orang pose macam gini then kau pose macam gini that kind of thing you want someone who's like aku ada idea aku last weekend aku buat macam gini tau kau nak buat macam gini you know that kind of thing then like eh kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang in thing in thing orang semua ambil gambar macam gini
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side oh macam okay okay okay ambil gambar okay okay kiri kiri sikit okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya cause okay like um after the nikah I told alina I don't want to take pictures first lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu so parents come up here we salam then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties err came up first and then err they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of alina and then after that our photographer macam ya is ya we I understand all this ah they they get super excited ambil gambar dulu cepat before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan lina dulu
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought jom ambil gambar
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be macam okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me err salam parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps lah
semuanya okay
oh aku baru balik dari batam meet my family during this COVID lah
some place most of the places is quiet lah some of them err ada yang dah tutup tak ada apa tu business kan some of them close
ah like massage parlours all dah tutup
a lot yang know like people with families lah with families I think affected them a lot orang some of them macam duduk kat kedai kopi hari-hari you know cannot do anything have to wait for this thing to be over kesian
so he dia dah tak dah takde kerja so he buat tu lah parking lah do the parking
tanam sayur kat kat kat apa dekat tu ah dekat tu kat barelang
tanam sayur dapat gaji lah sikit-sikit
ya yang macam kan normally kan over there when you park your car before you move kan ada orang datang they they call it orang tukang parking lah so they jaga to park jaga that parking area parking shift so one day I think the pay is about hundred thousand which is about singapore ten dollars
harvest already then after that jual ah kat pasar okay okay okay then other than that how's how's the the the the mall there the tourists there and the
what do you call it the massage spa abeh shopping centre
huh that means from singapore you have to fly to jakarta first then from jakarta quarantine for one night lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang then pergi batam why never go batam directly from singapore take ferry
okay okay tanah merah because you know just recently I heard I read this news you know this singaporean that have not return back from singapore for seventeen years ah dia cakap macam macam nazi lah macam world war two lah kena halau sana halau sini I not sure whether it's true or not lah but
ah so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like macam nazi lah but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason ah
ah okay lah because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have sentosa hotel I don't know lah these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning ah betul tak then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
okay lah alhamdulillah lah at least okay apa at least something kan daripada takde apa-apa then kalau kata orang tu kalau tak nak tak nak tak nak bayar then jangan lah keluar duduk kat singapore jer betul tak
oh abeh sekarang tengah buat apa lepak ah sekarang tak buat apa-apa ah
makan tidur makan tidur terus menjadi tau badan cannot no badan semua menjadi nanti have to go for exercise already have to keep fit already if not ah mati ah then what what what what what you doing later after this
okay lah you are become your own boss what now is your own boss ah err own own job own own money everything your own don't don't need to report to anybody what just report to the money the longer you work you get more money err but kerja kerja kerja sikit dapat sikit kerja banyak dapat banyak okay lah alhamdulillah lah kata orang kan
okay lah you control your own finances lah in a way that you can control your time then kalau ada apa-apa boleh habis siang kalau takde apa-apa boleh kerja lambat sikit so at least in a way
new year tahun ini jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak
betul betul betul I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd lah so
apa-apa yang countdown semua dekat neighbourhood estate jer lah
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning lah macam north east south west ke apa so kat mana-mana yang okay kau tinggal north ada bunga api tinggal south ada bunga api west ada bunga api so instead of going to the central punya bunga api so everybody goes your own division their own area their own kampung to enjoy lah but anyway I mean
singapore bila
sixteen march ke
sixteen march dia orang tutup sixteen march sekali kira march april may june july august september november a'ah betul lah dah sembilan bulan ah
pejam celik pejam celik dah nine months dah nak masuk satu tahun
you no need to take sikit-sikit what what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
you have to book through these five different platform okay err yang satu changi and then err I think trip err there's another three more lah aku tak ingat mana satu err then
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself ah you can use that or you can use partly the only thing yang you cannot do yang kau tak boleh buat is kau buat stack up maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus then kita combine dua ratus kita stay in hotel for free ah itu tak boleh tapi
kalau let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can uh offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up ah that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it lah so in the domination of ten meaning let say kalau kau example kalau kau pergi zoo ke apa kan maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars lah or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that ah tapi tak boleh combine lah that's how it goes but
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to kelam-kabut kata orang kan ah pelan-pelan ah next year pun boleh january pun boleh february pun boleh as long as pakai sebelum july lah so ya
kau belum pernah pergi sea aquarium ah eh talking about sea aquarium aku pun pernah pergi ah adventure cove
ah mampus
macam mana boleh tak orginal ada potong potong ke mampus kat mana ni kat batam ni indonesia lah
dia ambil they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus jer ah kurang ah wah ini macam pun boleh eh mati
mampus take advantage of the whole situation lah to get something ah
takut daripada negative jadi positive
macam-macam ah eh sekarang ni

err saiful wedding then along the way I think because of this COVID semua tarik-tarik then in the end decided not to go when the announcement came that those who goes to singapore ah those from singaporean goes to overseas come back have to do quarantine have to do swab everything then become viral so in the end tak jadi pergi but alhamdulillah they get married in singapore first before the main one at malaysia what so kat malaysia semua cancel kan everything cancel because of this COVID ya ya ya true true true this year ya I think ya ya after that ah I think during that period still
people are still was-was fifty fifty whether to go or not to go to go or not to go then after that

hello this is recording pertama kita bersama saya wesley because this is our first recording okay I akan explain apa jer yang kita akan berbual so please bear dengan kita kita err recording ini akan berlangsung selama satu jam so every recording kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
bersama conversation partner yang I dah pilih
so err untuk conversation ini yang pertama sekali I have my own sister nama dia rismah okay
so for this recording's conversation partner err rismah akan uh introduce herself you can start now
okay that's very nice okay thank you so much for being a part of today's conversation eh ah terima kasih banyak-banyak and sekarang kita akan err bincang
jadi setiap conversation kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
atau lebih lah kita tergantung uh it depends so untuk topic hari ini kita akan berbual pasal
mango buah mangga any thoughts okay so bila dengar bila first dengar jer uh this word what comes to your mind bila dengar mango jer when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing apa jer
I happen to like mango juga so uh bila dengar mango jer kan macam woo sedap ah like
rasa macam wah
macam nak makan jer mango eh macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal mango jer macam nak makan sahaja so uh first jer kita uh bila dengar mango
actually bila first dengar jer macam rasa
I don't know if you've uh I don't I don't know if any of you dah pernah dengar ke tak but
the brand mango ni memang makcik I memang suka pakai baju mango this T shirt from this brand nama dia mango err by the way ini
tak sponsored lah eh so kita ya faham-faham jer
okay so what comes to mind bila dengar mango kita dah berbual okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay jadi err buah mango ini kalau kita berbual if we talk about the shape we are
um it's slightly bended it's bengkok sikit ke dalam kalau you tengok betul-betul
something macam apa benda ya shape dia so
mango ini memang interesting memang it's
we can somehow cut it well in a way that kita boleh makan betul tak
mm so kita boleh potong belah dua we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so dia macam kotak-kotak gitu so we can we can eat it like that atau kita boleh
kupas kulit dia and then kita boleh makan
macam gitu jer macam
apa uh we slice it we we can just slice the
and okay shape it's memang irregular tapi dia macam bentuk yang okay lah macam kan macam tak
uh selain daripada besides the shape
about one or two colours so dia ada colour yellow dia ada colour oren
and dia ada juga colour hijau so yang
okay selain hijau there's also there's also red betul tak
okay so err these four types yang paling banyak kita like the ones that we see a lot
usually the the ones that we usually see betul tak so
err yang paling sedap
I honestly tak tahu yang mana yang paling sedap because I've only tried
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so uh the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
mango where can we buy where can we find mangoes nak cari dekat mana eh mango ini
dalam context singapore eh kita boleh cari mango ini
senang nak cari sebenarnya it's very easy to find because
dekat mana mana ada like dekat setiap penjuru singapore mesti ada mango
mana mana mesti ada lah mango
kadang ah sometimes there are like fruit sellers that just
just so that they can sell their their fruits lah gitu jadi dia orang jual buah-buah yang dia orang dah tangkap ke dia orang dah
dapat ke tak tahu dapat dari mana but dia orang jual lah
literally dekat stations and
di dekat singapore ini like we all live err somewhat we we kinda all live near an station betul tak
err besides supermarket pasar mana lagi boleh nak cari mango
err as in it's very easy to find mango lah dekat singapore ini kan pasal it's it's a common fruit
product apa jer yang kita boleh pakai kita boleh cari apa um tak tahu lah
makeup makeup mungkin ada kot eh macam yang rasa mango I I tak tahu tapi so far macam okay let's say kalau macam product kalau betul betul ada mesti ada macam uh shampoo
conditioner yang rasa mango
ah lip balm pun ada
there's a lot okay okay besides like beauty products okay tadi we we were talking about
mungkin kita boleh talk about mango tea
teh teh yang berperisa mango err mango
banyak juga tahu and it's it's err
it has calming effects uh I don't know honestly mango just makes me happy maybe not everybody feels the same towards it tapi err definitely
I bet yang those of you who are listening to this you all already feel like you all definitely want to get mangoes right now betul tak
so err apa lagi eh
dalam segi product kita tadi dah berbual pasal beauty products kita dah berbual pasal
but kita belum sentuh ini
memang dessert paling banyak have you tried any desserts yang ada mango
entah eh when okay when the colour the colour of the mango kan yellow kan
bila the first thing when you see
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is betul-betul attractive
my attention to it so bila nampak macam colour colour bingsu like she said uh she mentioned earlier bila nampak colour colour bingsu macam
ee nak ah tengok macam the first thing I see is the the
apart from that I feel like dia consistency dia memang
memang cukup eh macam it's not too watery dia chewy dia macam
just nice ah texture dia dekat dalam mulut it's
macam it's it it it seems like she's explaining a little too deep but it's okay
I mean uh we're literally just talking about mangoes for the next one hour maybe we would just you know if we can finish all of the things that we can talk about nanti kita boleh berbual pasal buah-buah lain buah-buahan lain pula kan
okay jadi dari segi product kita dah berbual pasal bingsu sebagai dessert
apa lagi eh
um maybe itu jer kot maybe that's all we have for mango products err I mean
if we're going to talk about benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan there's definitely mango as a brand itu
uh itu macam
yang quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
cuma word mango jer kot I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like macam betul-betul macam wah nampak jer macam wah
uh besides that uh kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi mango ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu
betul betul I feel like ah okay but honestly I think err
ya you can do anything you want dengan mango cause I feel that
entah eh
the it's interesting that mango is the topic untuk hari ini pasal kita actually tak
kita suka makan mango tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
mango pudding we always have mango pudding dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari mango pudding especially dekat wedding
like at your friend's house mesti ada err
because kita tak pernah I mean jarang lah ya berbual pasal mango that's what I find it interesting kalau kita berbual untuk our first recording kita berbual pasal mango pasal
entah I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
tak pernah ada kan
I really wish ada mango soda
um that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time kot
uh do you know that uh in some parts of the world dekat luar negeri some parts of the world dekat tempat lain
the fact that dekat southeast asia dekat asia tenggara kita actually the king of fruits ini
so besides that uh okay the the scientific name eh untuk ini ini buah is actually mangifera indica
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit itu macam semacam buah itu the type dia nama dia stone fruit
kan uh ada berry ada apa apa semua then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because memang if you look at it
okay so it means ah okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so dia punya biji err biji buah dia itu memang besar
okay and mango itu actually juga native dekat india
dekat india itu
uh southeast asia asia tenggara that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
how interesting is that macam
lama gila seh like what the hell
now we're born okay at this point of time I have no idea what I'm talking about but kita go on jer eh
size dengan colour dia juga tapi dia uh lain-lain
an impressive nutrition profile ini betul betul
err mango ini memang penuh dengan khasiat there's like so much nutrition value value
means that err selain kita besides kita besides
and then apa lagi eh
okay in this website yang I dah cari ini dia kata err in fact studies link
err digestive health and eyesight dan juga has a lower risk of certain cancers
okay nak tahu tak uh nutritional value dia
okay so calories sembilan puluh sembilan
one point four grams gitu lah
carbs err twenty four point seven grams habis dia punya lemak dia is zero point six grams
lagi eh okay dietary fiber two point six grams
copper wah banyak eh dia punya nutritional dia copper err twenty percent of the folate eighteen percent of the
apa itu tak pernah dengar but sure seven percent of the potassium six percent of the riboflavin
thiamine four percent of the dengan magnesium four percent of the
okay err dia dia bilang dekat sini it also contains small amounts of phosphorus panthothenic acid
selain daripada itu mango pun is very high in antioxidants okay
okay enough in the nutritional facts we are left with three minutes to talk about mango and maybe the next thirty minutes kita boleh berbual-bual pasal buah-buah buah-buah lain lah pula eh
okay experiences dengan buah mango eh
I don't know every experience I had with buah mango is quite interesting because
I always have mango bingsu dengan kawan-kawan ke dengan siapa-siapa betul tak what about you do you have any uh interesting experiences dengan buah mango
um betul I think she's right
memang I think buah mango ini senang busuk eh and dia masak cepat so
ya just just bila dah beli itu when you
uh as uh your fridge ke tapi it doesn't have to be in the fridge also lah I mean orang tiap-tiap orang it depends right oh and err talking about experience dengan mango I feel that I like to cut up mangoes macam potong-potong mango habis taruh dekat dalam freezer
woo dah keluar macam
semi frozen macam entah sedap macam ice you know
betul that's I agree strongly dengan uh whatever that she said and also oh my god I can't believe I forgot about this
exactly itu pasal okay like okay let's just talk about it I suka mango ice cream yang dia dekat yang ada macam popsicle itu
oh my god bila you take one bite dia macam
wah panas-panas makan itu sedap seh macam seriously like that's the best
betul I don't know
cara you explain macam a bit weird tapi tak apa lah eh I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize kalau topic dia macam lame sangat but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
take a break from mango topic because uh whoever that is going to listen this for one hour mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal mango betul tak so let's hear about your day what have you done today
question dia tadi satu question eh tapi dah melalut eh tak apa it's okay
okay this week actually is my first week err since err holiday that school resumes so err as per usual I had my class today tapi because you know kan sekarang tengah pandemic tengah
tengah you know like the the virus is you know masih dekat singapore masih ada cases lah kan so today we had
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I pun dah melalut tak apa it's okay
okay back to the topic err seriously I think quite sad because dah berapa bulan seh dekat rumah like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive dekat dekat sekolah like my brain my work like ah I can just think and do work
much more than I can do work at home macam macam mana eh macam susah lah buat kerja dekat rumah cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily dekat rumah so your productivity level is not as
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that dekat rumah lagi err productive lah but today is uh
nothing too extreme nothing to some macam okay okay jer lah I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive dekat rumah ke or is more productive dekat luar
betul exactly
I had sambal fish and sambal egg
then err ada this apa nama dia macam soup petola gitu
dengan bihun bihun eh ke suun
I think it's suun this dia macam bihun but it's like um
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles yang dari japan so I think that's what it is then apa lagi eh um ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today um because you know uh work's getting really really stressful jadi macam you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then err lepak lepak dah itu jer
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about apa eh apa yang best eh nak berbual okay let's talk about our favorite music
um kalau kita berbual pasal
artist okay kita berbual pasal genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very err much the same as hers um it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean macam
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song lah macam okay that song is my favourite song
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have jadi macam bila dengar jer macam oh my god my emotions semua keluar but like
let's talk about the next genre my next genre yang favourite itu let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between err western songs dengan
however macam similar dia itu macam sama tapi lain lah you you you get what I mean
dia punya upbeat dia punya instrumental semua sama tapi it's just that the language probably different kot macam that's the distinct difference
okay and then um my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's paling banyak lagu-lagu western dekat kot that is the one that's very popular
I I would say lagu um
uh dah lupa tajuk dia
ah I tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini but
it's called mevoy M E V O Y daripada eh the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice dia
apa lagi eh ah oh ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I main asal asal jer
sebarang ah apa lagi eh okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is
entah banyak man I have a lot of groups that I like
then err okay I also because err this is my family is an um indonesian family so kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada indonesia juga lah so err
we would say it as pulau jawa
that's where we come from and then lagu-lagu from there is semua
variety juga eh macam they have err songs yang macam western western gitu dia orang pun ada songs macam ballad
dia ada genre genre ah koplo oh my god koplo my favourite genre
it's dia macam traditional gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat
lagi eh ya so that's my favorite music okay kalau let's say your favourite food apa what's your favourite food
I mean I'm I'm feeling it right now cause ya I mean tak boleh tak boleh avoid lah pasal kita berbual pasal makan kan so automatically as human beings kan kita first thing berbual pasal makan jer mesti fikir pasal makan betul tak
betul exactly but eh tadi you berbual pasal tenderfresh kan I tak pernah seh pergi tenderfresh is it
is it murah ke mahal ke
it's okay I mean err okay kalau macam okay err for me kan kalau makanan favourite I is
I categorize my favourite food dalam dua
categories tahu macam satu I like err
satu is comfort food dengan lagi satu is food
I okay comfort food ini kan is the the the category for comfort food ini kan is the type of food that I can eat
everyday tak jelak-jelak like
tak bosan bosan every time every time I can just I can eat that everyday literally tapi kalau macam let's say kita berbual pasal err the food that really like macam
okay so my first one my comfort food eh is bakso mi bakso I don't know if you guys know that
mungkin dekat singapore ada singapore definitely ada
tapi kalau dekat malaysia I'm not so sure dekat brunei pun I tak tahu sangat
but definitely dekat indonesia dekat singapore ada confirm
so that's my comfort food err mi bakso
I would have a lot of sambal to go with it and I also have ah pansit goreng
pangsit goreng in um english is basically just a fried wanton lah kan
I know it's like a little bit like whoa apa sia
but that's like really macam once in a while gila like when I have money that I'll get that
kalau tak no usually my friends would be the one that would bring me there treat me
I feel bad but you know it's a it's a good treat I mean kalau macam birthday jer kan macam confirm
confirm dia orang plan dekat situ situ juga pasal they know that I love the K
okay so now we talk about favorite food apa lagi eh
ya okay so let's jump into it apa eh err my favorite artist eh
actually I I ini sebenarnya tak tak ada favourite artist tahu macam I jarang eh
apa err I jarang ini apa tengok tengok cerita
but ah kalau okay but recently I watch a lot of netflix kan jadi macam uh
I selalu tengok the same show bila makan tengok the same show bila
bila buat apa-apa pun selalu tengok same show like I always watch the same show and
okay jadi err apa lagi eh oh ya okay my second show is brooklyn nine nine it's
then apa lagi uh my last show is called don't trust the B
so ya lah ah that's my three show then apa lagi eh ah ya
dia dekat dalam cerita brooklyn nine nine she's all tough rambut dia kerinting like she pakai leather jacket she's all that you know macam
just tough gila ah macam cool gila sia tengok macam like

you can't expect people to live at home habis tak tengok cerita apa apa pun
boring gila
err apa lagi eh okay err since kita punya do you have any last words macam like you know to wrap it up
but I thought that mango is an easy topic to talk about kan macam senang apa nak berbual pasal mango apa yang susah sangat so but I I thought wrong so throughout the whole time it's a little bit like um apa seh
and they are english language which is what I'm really fluent in then apa itu
I juga boleh eh I pun boleh berbual bahasa melayu lah macam normal cause we're singaporeans kan I'm born here
um berbual bahasa melayu just a normal thing but kita pun boleh berbual bahasa indonesia because
my family's is an indonesian family so kita my
uh next fluent or I would say a native language would be bahasa indonesia actually
because uh that's that's how I was raised I actually berbual
um my parents' native languages like dia orang punya bahasa asal dia orang which is
err bahasa sunda dengan bahasa jawa so my mom speaks sundanese and my dad speaks javanese so

pasal to tell you the truth right aku macam aku have always been thinking like
senang untuk kita start the topic senang untuk kita follow with each other
maybe because of the connection ah mystery and connection pada kecil kita orang dah have been together this semua berbual
so kita nak click senang so for dia tak kan ada dead space oh
in your recording bagi aku that's very important kalau kau ada dead space jer mati jer
ya juga
then aku rasakan kalau kita nak buat podcast eh

tak boleh aku akan hook
aku tengok dia orang punya reel besar besar macam main boat punya kan
ikan todak kau nak kena bawa ni jer pokok pisang
what the fuck todak
aku tak tahu nak apa kau nak bawa pokok pisang jer bro senang
baik sia
betul kau dah pernah pergi kedai fishing yang dekat changi
bagus ah tu murah tak nampak macam murah jer
ah betul
lagi kau tak boleh nego depan orang ramai-ramai
but you kena susah tu dah kau tak suka pergi kedai ramai orang sangat kau nak nego susah because it is unethical for you to nego in front of other customers ah nanti ada customer pun nak orang itu dah tak swing
but really see how ah kalau satu customer jer
sometimes aku pernah try tau aku tengah nego but because of that one customer customer tu support aku bila aku nego sia
aku ada bilang kalau engkau bagi dia ini price aku pun beli
kau faham ah alah can lah this price I also buy from you what we buy two set leh kita pun jadi kawan macam gitu
makna orang tu terpaksa bagi ah for that price
lagi uh lagi eh lagi thirteen minutes
tak rasa english ah serious
aku hoping this one hour yang trial ni
lepas cantik-cantik so at least we can continue with the next one nanti
kan dia bayar dua belas
but bagi aku tengok macam mana at least from this trial kita tahu that that dua belas dollar dia pun akan aku rasa dia pun akan feedback
like lepas dia dengar kan dia pun akan feedback like bising sangat ke apa ke then we know what to do from there ah
okay lah bro kalau dapat at least the first two hours is thirty is thirty dollars ah dua belas dengan lapan belas
kau nak try message message dia tak like takde is it ada limit ke takde limit ke
takde limit shiok sia aku all the way sia aku buat ini
senang jer
aku it's just the problem that macam aku eh I know sometimes I hold myself from doing something
because aku tahu if I'm hook it might be a problem
for bicycle aku limit kan diri aku five hundred jer that time bila aku nak beli basikal but kau tengok berapa jual beli basikal
bro within that three months with that five hundred aku dapat dua road bike Cinelli and Giant aku jual beli jual beli last last aku beli specialised punya basikal
all and all aku spend about five hundred dollars
itu aku masih jaga-jaga diri aku tau bro aku kalau tak jaga let's say aku because I know for a fact yang basikal tu example eh
I really want to get a Santa Cruz I don't mind selling both bike and getting a Santa Cruz but aku talk crap nak top up sikit see when all this top up datang aku nak dah control diri aku and I know when I go fishing it will be the same shit I need I need small reel I aku need small uh set-up aku need big set-up nak pergi boat aku nak ada boat set-up
sama sama because you know I kita jenis orang K lah for example lah eh taruk ah drill stool
aku tahu yang aku boleh beli multipurpose punya kata yang screwdriver

ya but I think more or less is confirm lah cause karim punya date pun macam
okay lah it's just satu hari jer apa right monday
anyway can there be a macam
why not cause like every time kita selalu buat like this kind of theme apa
yes ya because that one was dekat yang halia so
tanjong pagar theme apa
orang pakai good morning towels lah
kan I thought that time yang kita pergi makan then I was asking karim to decide on the matter
I don't know I don't know dia dah decide ke belum but I think that time dia ada cakap R
kat sembawang ada too bad kat sembawang ada
eh we did giant ke eh
by the way kipas tu mana
kan panas kat tempat dia
but dinner kita belum choose a place
kat kopitiam jer
nak kena lohei eh
okay kita cari father christmas
like macam
macam carousel
that's very menyemak kalau aku jadi server tu aku bingit
sibuk aku nak buat kerja sibuk kau nak order
he wanted to go there but dia kena cancel or something you know no like the location kena change or something
jonas very vegan makan
I thought we can book but tak boleh mingle
tapi yang last one makan seorang
okay lah macam homecoming ah gitu
I mean tak payah jonas pun susah kan nak makan
nanti edward complain lagi cakap should have change lah should have change lah
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel jer but date is settled lah and I think makan pun is
kat sini pun dekat kan
hotel punya room jer lah
I thought they are going to prioritise yang the elderly or like
don't know kalau dekat sana like
then like it's err pasal plants
like plant nursery with dia punya mak
then um the funny thing was dia seorang jer yang pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask so it's like huh
and ya lah dia orang punya rumah kan selalu mansion mansion berapa storey semua kan so they can afford the space but it's already like
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya dekat desert punya bukan
no no is not succulent it's like probably macam the height
no it's like macam the height of the snake plant ah
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not bukan macam kau punya this thing
it's quite bendy but then bila dia dah tua like it's quite stiff kind
yang dia beli tu is quite an old one so it's quite tall
pokok mango
ada banyak problem than benefit
especially like a globalized world right now macam kalau you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so macam there's a lot of disruptions
bukan natural way lah like like the business way the business way is that macam kena halt and and
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because macam like
you think about it all the businesses dia orang punya momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then kena halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of err during business ah so it's too soon to adapt
cause macam like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area lah but myself like ang mo kio this kind of area my banyak orang-orang tua live right then like you see those apek-apek duduk bawah block baca surat khabar that kind just like just duduk bawah block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is macam
I don't know but I feel lah macam dia orang punya
normal way of living pun kena change forcefully change so in that sense you especially bila dia orang dah like this kind of age
one thing is that dia orang pun could probably be living alone and this is their only form of macam keeping sane and err you know socialise that kind of thing like
businesses wise I think um I think between businesses and societal macam thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think kalau macam
kalau you are just suay lah then you just buka business baru then kena lockdown then macam okay lah too bad for you lah but businesses wise like you said it can be a
err just a method oh oh a matter of adaptation and how quick you are lah but then also macam those traditional businesses pun macam losing out also because
they are traditional lah like kat kedai kopi ni semua
okay lah I mean on the other hand pun macam you need to also see like macam for example cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu
but I think about limitation leh macam like for example the reason why maybe cik limah tak pergi digital is is maybe because dia punya um expertise is not there then kalau she go digital pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help dekat the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya lah but then like on her side pun macam it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then kalau let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
enforcing or like really okay lah enforcing macam a bit tough lah but like um pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
underprivileged families where you are staying macam like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
there was also this macam article I think dekat dekat mana eh
the straits times or something like that yang this um
the and all these case lah basically macam dia orang punya wifi bukannya strong kan like you know you have a lot to handle
aku tengok kat luar tingkap jer
foreign worker punya dorm kan ya
maybe I don't know like dia orang should probably lockdown in stages agaknya um
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the orang-orang tua who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
I mean orang tua like they probably don't have
it's probably just a land line dekat rumah yang ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
cause I think dekat news pun ada cakap pasal the number of domestic abusers
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite lepak
problem okay what do we talk about pasal societal business err
no ya bukannya tracks semua ada pokok
but aedes is because of air bertakung right
unless lah got one pokok pisang dekat in the middle of the north south line from yew tee to kranji
ke wild boar dekat dekat sembawang
dia orang enforce the rule people will really follow apa it's like you have all those mm mm
kau bunuh ah
apa benda kau bunuh lion tu
were these animals obtain kan and so kalau macam they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
merepek ah
remember there was this report pasal mink farm dekat mana entah
that animals roasted already lah pantang liao
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not dia punya
wait lah nanti dia dah besar dah lah letak balik kat dalam
so technically dia orang punya care is quite princess lah they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves gulung like that then they will
this thing doesn't gulung what
dia jadi go
dia jadi brown
I didn't know then no I never no lah tak jadi
ya like it cannot get cold seem like merepek ah dia just setakat satu malam jer
apa is standard pokok
ya bodoh
ya so it's a very sturdy plant dia punya leaf macam like those kind of pokok pisang punya leaves but it's err
of course right cause you are not pokok pisang
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully dia tak mati
they never like pakai those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the dabao there from container dia just scoop air gitu then dia
pail of water and pour the plant mah dia pakai watering can jer
ya I mean they will say lah like macam kalau the top all the dry then you can water that kind lah bukannya hari-hari dia water the plant
tak apa I think for now kita kena err try our best to talk to fill in the one hour ahead
yes okay so apa yang sulaiman Twitter macam mana nak start
okay so basically sejak dulu I've always wanted to go to the kampung nak stay the night tapi sulaiman dah ajak so tak dapat tidur overnight cuma setakat gi mancing overnight then aku ni expert pergi sana without any proper clothing
and uh the the dah jadi mangsa to all these sandflies that's why right now you can see that I'm wearing all these sleeves to cover my aurat
err I went to the one that is nearer to to sulaiman's house juga lah it's it's just a
kalau jetty tu jauh jetty tu is really quite a distance this one is yang kat belakang kampung you'll be able to walk to this particular part of the beach then kat sana kita gi cast our rods lah
no that time was all the way to jelutong that one is all the way at the other end of the island yang ni betul-betul kat belakang kampung melayu
tak tahu orang melayu kan
okay you need a best part err banyak petuk tapi is just yang ikan yang aku tunjuk tu ah yang ikan tudung periuk
or in english we say the spotted sequel fish ya tapi ikan tu the story lagi best
aku dah mancing aku sengaja feel nak reel in tapi bila dah dapat eh tiba-tiba ganas betul-betul kau dapat rasa lawan bila kita dah angkat aku panggil sulaiman to come and check then all of a sudden kita tengok kat dalam dia punya mata kail kan betul-betul sangkut kat hidung
betul-betul on the nose
then the rest of the night tak ada ikan
kita jumpa dekat singapore so the the asal before kita jumpa sekeluarga
then dia datang naik grab bila dia claw grab ingat dia keluar gi bazaar ke apa
betul-betul keluar barang one by one ada claw back trolley besar satu bakul satu err bawa langsir
nak tukar langsir dekat dalam rumah dia then actually the next day more fun keluarga dia datang the next day dia nya extended relatives lah dia datang bawa tiga
connections lah kalau sebab kalau sulaimannya family yang dia punya extended family ni memang satu orang tu driver so kalau coincidentally dia dapat arrange with the driver senang lah tak payah bayar tambang free of charge
okay so kita dah sampai kampung sulaiman get everything ready six o'clock then salin baju semua
err that's what made me worried lah tengok dia dah pakai all full suit but I have nothing like am I supposed to prepare something on my end then terus
initially no intention tapi bila dah nampak sulaiman keluarkan joran tu the intention came out lah
six twenty five kita gerak then from there kita jalan all the way to that spot
we we actually walk all the way to this part of the dam ya actually macam where you get all the air keluar masuk then bila air pasang semua macam marina barrage lah and then you get on top of the stone then sulaiman cakap wan err ni part gerek tau bila high tide kita tak boleh keluar tau
kau kau nak tak abeh aku cakap go jer ah don't scared then betul-betul bila high tide eh terus sulaiman pointed at me wan tengok terus kita dah surrounded kiri kanan air pasang besar
then at first macam mula-mula tak boleh understand lah like the the depth of the air tapi bila air surut
once you see that low tide dia punya drop from the top of the dam to the bottom seram sia dua dua tingkat yes
so macam dari jauh tak nampak tapi betul-betul because of that that err concrete structure bila dah air tumpah bawah jatuh dalam seh
ya so basically macam this man-made structure is like very far away from the beach so there's this path yang kita kena jalan atas
then err ada from there is like a hill downwards lah so from there ada slope to err to bakau-bakau sini and after that we had to climb on certain bricks to get onto the structure so bila air pasang
the whole valley below semua ni semua covered so it's just us on this on this structure
so that time I think lucky lah sebab I think the tide was supposed to be three metres plus then the highest eh
betul-betul macam sini tau then dia cakap man kalau get any higher how aku cakap macam tu lah wan
takde there's no is open is basically your marina barrage bridge is basically the same logic as that thing
I think next time you go there confirm kau try juga high tide got stranded for like we were stranded for I think a good six hours six hours err because
air naik pasang baru pukul sepuluh but the coast too low then after that we were there until
pukul empat pukul empat dia dah naik sepuluh malam ya then after that pukul satu
tu apa was the highest then after that betul-betul tengok eh kita literally sia
macam tsunami betul-betul tengok bila air pasang air surut ombak dari luar masuk dalam
tak juga okay itu best okay this part censored sikit bila nak kencing kita ada satu spot
satu spot on the whole man-made structure kita technically I will consider this macam the north eastern part of it
away from the laut tapi towards the kampung
habis tu ada lah tengah rilek terus dengar ada kat belakang what what's that noise jangan pandang belakang oh
two three times because there's nothing much to do but sulaiman what he did most was he he makan some Pringles lah
okay so sulaiman dia dia tunjuk something this one is about naz yang recommend
dia ada satu backpack ni dia jadi tempat duduk
kirakan macam backpack punya the the sponge tu dia punya padding you can actually convert into a seat then after that sulaiman just duduk jer atas
but for my end ini tempat legend aku tak ada benda then um sulaiman punya mum cakap wan err kau tengok kau belakang ada ke tak
then I I I find this yang the simple basic students yang lipat yang buka tutup boat
so it was already like decomposing and then after that I just sat down and then kita testing dulu lah kat kampung tapi bila kita testing kan mesti nak kena fragile sikit tapi bila dah kat laut duduk sekejap aku ingat kayu yang raput tapi the whole boat collapsed
mana oh jelutong uh uh mm pulau ketam
dapat duit I don't know dapat joke the ikan
johan eh bukan ke
ikan johan ke I've heard ikan johan before dia macam ikan duri tapi besar
itu johan is like the middle leh it feels so weird
ikan duri apa tu jahat uh huh uh huh
I thought johan tu ikan keli besar pe oh
six duris so all the yang middle medium lah no jahans
that's why ah bento I wanna say jaring
net net lah jaring lah I'm just gonna say jaring or jala ah jala alright
ni pancing malam ke pagi overnight oh
ni COVID ke no
ah cause I thought the uncle was the one who bring you all the way right baiknya express
dah bayar lebih bawa lebih weh
mm mampus mampus
is it like the normal crabs or macam ketam-ketam bakar begitu
wah flower crabs yang kat pasar selalunya fuyoh the ones you get blue or brown
if blue if I'm not wrong is male tak ada telur ya brown usually is yang female lah
scary horror yes mampus okay carry on carry on
I wan two or wan three I wan three right mampus alright
orh pulau ubin juga okay okay
eh apa ni ah
tu lah mine mine I I wear arm sleeves you can't see but it's it's poking through lah poking through
but okay in terms of azan eh because this one also the same thing happened to me that time when I go with sulaiman but the the thing is uh not the spot but basically in the kampung melayu juga when we are back at home it was betul-betul subuh time lah
then when I was outside I thought like somebody was you know playing on the radio azan or quran
but then when I go outside I literally stand in the middle semua gelap I just stand in the middle and then I faced towards malaysia lah then I can really hear surau kat sana tengah playing eh tengah playing pula eh tengah tu lah tengah prepare tengah solat subuh
then for the first time macam the whole kampung betul-betul every subuh eh I think this one has to be like every day ah everyday in pulau ubin ada jer quran playing
so there's always quran throughout the whole island boleh dengar because kampung it's from malaysia lah you can hear from malaysia
so that means because because I think probably memang isolated then there's nothing to block except the trees then I can only suspect is the surau if I'm not mistaken is the masjid kampung pasir puteh
so white sands literally dekat malaysia ya then that masjid is when we look at the map
is quite close to by right the side so your area pulau ketam should hear it louder than kampung melayu
and ya lah so yang okay so yang pulau ketam is it the one that has this two storey building is that your spot
ya kenapa seh mana ada
tadi in the beginning I already say in the beginning in the beginning I already say a lot of malay so that's why right now I am trying my best to try to
campurkan melayu sikit with the english but when I try to put in the melayu I understand that I hesitate a bit jadi terkaku lah
habis bila dah focused then err then all the sentence everywhere
jadi kita try our best to not really mix everything lah cause that's that's against what they want us to do pe
ah yes ada kisahnya all
kalau dapat ke tak dapat bilang jer lah but instead you just keep the okay one of the things this one I can say lah because I think one month dah over pun
err I applied for this err safe distancing err ambassador at masjid omar salmah
so that one is the I think to me is the most saddest because it is the most yang kasi harapan because
when they called me I was at Sheng Siong and and then my they called the worst time cause I was supposed to pay but then they called me and then I answered the phone and my mum terpinga-pinga lah macam ni nak bayar ni
ya ya then for me I was err I just answer the call then cakap hi err assalamualaikum err err is this shazwan on the line
then I cakap ah yes may I know who is this dia cakap oh I am from masjid muhajirin mula-mula aku fikir aku apply masjid omar salmah asal why is it yang masjid muhajirin yang call
then I realise ah because err this thing is by right ada muhajirin but they need someone to err cover omar salmah so they called me everything then they asked to clarify certain parts of my resume
then aku explain to them lah yang okay aku ni dua puluh empat tahun
she ask the question tahu ke tak yang this place is very far very ulu ada transports sendiri ke tak then I said no but I've seen the map I can still walk there fifteen minutes lah
within the week so sekarang dah satu bulan
and there's still nothing so that's why I say this kind of thing eh like like at least bilang lah like don't keep the person waiting cause I was actually hopeful maybe
this is the rezeki I've been waiting for ya ke tak it's not it's not the one so that's why I'm like
err it's not it's tak baik lah tak baik
I think I think I think that one is the worst lah okay so to talk about sakit hati this one I don't know if if kita jaga aib ke tak jaga aib because it it it involves masjid juga
so so recently I I think for for for confidentiality I will not name the masjid
but I will say the proximity of the masjid the masjid is in the east so this masjid he surrounding dia has quite a few other masjids
yes so this is a part of singapore yang ada banyak masjid quite near each other ah if you knows what I'm talking about
ya but it's not the one that you probably think about is one of the masjid yang kat dalam-dalam sikit okay it's one it's definitely tak tak famous lah which is why lagi aku fed up
the whole story is yang mula-mula I got this call from this err person from I would say the communications department lah
kan so the communications department suddenly call me on monday afternoon saying um assalamualaikum shazwan err saya nik ni err
I understand from this person that you are helping us to design a poster so first of all in my mind siapa sia ni terus cakap since when am I helping to design a poster
for that time no because the way they say we have a deadline by wednesday is like err we are urgent lah urgent can you help us in my mind cakap
aku tak cakap benda I didn't I didn't want to be on board tapi the way you say macam kesian juga ini masjid
but the thing is that I don't like or don't agree on is that he just mentang-mentang kasi my
I did the poster so the poster was everything you know me lah my style is everything I do on Powerpoint then bila aku dah buat semua they they ask me
the first thing they asked is can you find the photos yourself of the of the asatizahs mentioned then aku fikir aku memang lah bukan orang alim
tapi who are these ustaz I don't know these ustaz what if I type the same ustaz and I put ustaz nama nama ustaz different person I wouldn't know also what
so that's why luckily I have this friend secondary school friend lah kita
aku minta tolong dia sebab dia pun by right macam orang masjid lah
and he he managed to provide me yang gambar-gambar betul lah so alhamdullilah so what I do is I just take the photos then I do the caricature lah basically it's just copy paste edit the shape
and make a cartoon version of the asatizah and the guest speaker so the guest speaker
yes so so that's why I say this masjidnya sebab apa
ada pula panggil fandi ahmad so I already did the design err I understand that the communications officer sebenarnya dia orang muda
so dia actually understand my style dia pun suka my style but of course kita akhirnya when it comes to all these things higher ups the final say then err
I think the the funniest argument is that one of the people on top say um aku rasa ada problem because I think later they are scared that because when it comes to this
so by right even for me lah when it comes to the hierarchy of such an event kita selalu moderator dulu you need a moderator to moderate then you have the speakers or your guests
so for me my logic is because of space constraint juga I put it in diagonal manner I put the moderator up here then the asatizahs together
and then I got fandi ahmad but the person who viewed this thing said err do you think it might be offensive to the asatizah that the moderator who is of lesser rank is higher
then in my mind aku fikir asatizah boleh fikir macam tu ke is that is that healthy for you to say eh aku lebih alim pe is that actually healthy sangat
but then he say but from left to right is the moderator is still first and then asatizah and then fandi ahmad would you think that the moderator because he is first in line he is of higher rank
that's why I say eh if I macam tu I I put circle pun you will find somewhere to start semua mesti salah punya right
we understand we know it's just that the higher ups refuse to listen ni yang susah orang tua tak nak dengar orang muda so the explanation is okay but I still feel ah that's it that's it so once that happens
err game lah so I I really at that time memang macam upset lah but the oh the final blow right is that yesterday
they they give it to the chairman chairman cakap okay okay go published Facebook Instagram published it was published I saw it
on Facebook and Instagram at eight dia pun bilang aku that timing and then after that the next day tiba-tiba the officer called me
that the pictures of asatizah are made into cartoons and then ya alah I fikir
but it's just is is is an effect I never made the nose bigger ke telinga besar ke is not I think but then the person that commented said it is offensive
to have the asatizah drawn as a cartoon then aku fikir balik ni macam kenapa nak terperinci sangat
ya so that's why in this situasi you can actually see
that orang tua is not very flexible they understand everything then
I really apologise for this thing um boleh tak
err kita delete all of your all of the drawings that you did and just put in the actual picture of the of the asatizah in my mind I was like
then the past three nights you asked me to make the last minute changes on the faces buat cantik-cantik bring it bigger make the font smaller
semua tu means nothing lah he say just delete everything just use the original photo can already
cakap we know of someone who can help us for free ah without consulting me or informing me at all
that is why bila aku dah tau dah find out who is the one responsible my Whatsapp was panas I literally texted
but only after I finished my poster I said err salam semua this is the poster that I have done
nanti tiba-tiba jer nama dah masuk dalam for benda-benda yang kita tak tahu pun apa nak kita nak buat
ah memang so so right now the thing is on that end the poster is still down is still taken down but
yang mereka masih persistent to make sure it's photos but I've already made it clear to the officer I'm sorry but I will not make any more changes because I feel disappointed I said it just just just blurt it out
and then the officer say I understand where you're coming from so I will still try my best to to err macam tukar err pemikiran orang-orang atas lah
cakap to understand that this doesn't this shouldn't offend people like how you think it will offend people because it's just
it's just a caricature tapi kita pun nak kena tengok logic tau the logic is the poster I did it because I I was informed of the age group
the age group was aimed for twelve to eighteen year olds kalau let's say you err
secondary school lah kau tengok gambar macam comic and gambar macam real mana satu yang kau macam more wah this one seems more interesting
so itu yang kelakar dia ni bahan lawak dia communication in the beginning pun tak kasi tau they never even inform me that I was supposed to do this thing
that's why I I I sound them all then betul-betul cakap I'm sorry I know I shouldn't have done this is it's unprofessional on my end I hope you may forgive me
then terpaksa lah kita forgive
tapi when they start saying oh by the way shazwan err can you just put the original picture ah that's it done I'm out thanks for nothing
because I mean to be fair juga lah if let's say you paid me and then I say this thing memang unprofessional of me because you already pay me but this part is that
you already say that I'm a volunteer know I mean I am forced ikhlas ke tak ikhlas so
that's the that's the sad part lah which is why it reminded me of the of the time yang dulu
kita ni kalau buat design ni freelance never do for free
mm itu lah
so that's why like when it comes to people always asking the designers to make changes macam for them is so easy that's why like
even for me there's always that moment cakap kalau senang senang kau buat lah sendiri what you mean so easy do yourself
itu lah that's why that's why even for me that's why I don't do freelance job because of this simple fact when you say I like it but can you no
then okay itu lah kadang-kadang kita fikir balik manusia ni semua menyakitkan hati
err even for you err folks over there that is listening in that is tuning into our err podcast terima kasih
kerana sudi mendengar kita err dah tak ada cerita cerita tu ada sebenarnya everything has been a true story believe it or not
ya lah tadi sebelum ni kita pergi bubble tea we we went to the bubble tea shop we went to we went to buy so just now like the initial story on the topic of
pelik lah but you know for the benefit of your program the thing that you are trying to do kita kita sudi tolong
sudikan masa kita pada malam sabtu ni untuk err tolong ah which is interesting because in english we say friday night tapi kalau like in in malay
err malam jumaat malam jumaat is thursday so the logic eh if you you if you're curious is that sebab kita

so I mean sekarang ini yang the more yang lebih
tengok lah macam mana berapa dia orang akan quote
macam uh the the other time I I I
I tanya quotation ya lah macam toilet itu toilet itu kalau dua toilet
kurang-kurang pun at least satu toilet pun at least maybe three four K
dua toilet is around lapan K just toilet
itu sekali terus habuk kirakan termasuk kitchen dapur bahagian sana lah sekaligus ah
tak yang yang bilik tak yang master bedroom vinyl kita almost thousand
thousand four thousand ah seribu lima seribu
apa yang bilik bilik master kita nak buka
agaknya lah
kalau nak ya lah kalau nak buat memang
memang I murah sikit lah tapi I think leceh ah
tak apa lah bayar lebih sikit biar the biar yang yang yang the experts
ya tapi bilik ini dia punya flooring
yes dia sejuk panas sejuk panas ha tengok ini dah merekah lah
that yang yang
dia merekah nanti jadi macam ah master bedroom ah sebelum sebelum itu kan macam masuk air semua kan nanti itu dah sebab sebelah
sebelah toilet itu yang masuk air semua itu yang sampai terpecah
sampai menggelembung eh
ini ini bukan ya ini bukan yang
I don't think this the ini vinyl yang
so so so tengok lah
kalau master bedroom we do it around berapa eh thousand
so kalau mungkin dua bilik ini mungkin
oh mungkin dalam dua ribu ke agaknya estimate nya
ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate lah tapi that time kita pun kita punya budget pun tak banyak kan so kita buat yang yang urgent dulu lah
sejuk ah
kalau ada ada baby baru ke so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety dia tak keras sangat
kalau jatuh pun at least dia ada macam uh cushion this vinyl kan underneath dia ada cushion kan
then tak sejuk sangat

ah north area because I'm I'm I'm the utara utara
you know utara
so you work what as a what macam a assistant
oh macam
macam abang ash
but ya eh tapi
part time don't you think it's macam menjejaskan your
I heard people saying sem okay lah I'm not sure about your your faculty but people saying that sem two is the most macam
alright mic test your you can hear me ah apa ni
tapi kalau kau nak kerja ah yes it's
bukan nursing tu like you already know where you want to work already
apa apa sign on lah
kau belum tahu eh
so kita kita nak kena pandai kita berbahasa melayu ya kita nak kena pandai uh apa ni
apa eh
apa eh
membahagikan no no that one is
don't talk nonsense chey apa eh plan
dude that's like a secondary school word kita tak tahu eh
we kita perlu
well well you know I I remember my peribahasa ya my idioms my idioms
yes takut titik lalu gempar you know what does that mean
ah esok kau tak boleh monday sayang sia kalau tak kita empat sia
tak boleh postpone eh
takleh ah
kau dah terror kan kau nak kau nak apa ni berpengalaman you know
kalau Pfizer ke apa sir kau duduk sana kau buat ambil you know
I salute saya tabik
your yes tabik salute
ah chey chey kau berbual merepek sia
honestly I feel like good looks is macam
genetic ah like kalau your parents
you macam
I rasa macam
good looks bukan benda yang you boleh work for but fit body is
dia tak boleh dapat any other way
I pun nak tanya
cause err I went I went to some I went to gardens by the bay kalau tak salah
because macam
I baru baru-baru ni I main apa tu
I I main kan then I noticed ah
you know then it's like especially now because everything is so macam
senang nak pergi nak nak fly back dari like singapore to like and all that stuff very interconnected so
I rasa macam
kalau kita orang err
kalau manusia were to be extinct right
then I rasa
most likely way would be dari viruses macam COVID lah that kind cause we are so
you never ever really hear about them pasal
tak ada banyak orang yang pergi africa
if we tapi kalau
going to africa to like visit ke apa
you might find like a lot more of these diseases more common in other places tapi like if you also see right
africa pun dia orang punya COVID cases not very high
so kita orang tak
tak prepared lah kira
I faham I faham
tu tu okay tu kalau
kalau population turun kan
the world gets better in a sense pasal
the the one problem that we're facing now is terlalu banyak orang tapi tak cukup err tak cukup resources macam you you said economics right that's the first thing that we learn too many wants not enough
so in a way unless like if yes our kita orang punya population turun
pasal like stuff like hunger and all that stuff
it will go down but it won't go extinct pasal there will come a point where
dah cukup like now we finally have enough
kalau you boleh err
kalau you boleh dapat tiga skill
yang err apa-apa skill lah you nak
apa skill yang mungkin you pilih
apa-apa lah
so kira like you you can you play soccer so kira maybe like you can dribble very well you can pass very well that kind
or if you want to like make it specific soccer to simplify also boleh lah
you punya
apa third one tadi
okay lah I feel like that yang yang the last one is
you you tak boleh manage stress you are done
in in my in my opinion lah like macam
because I run like competitively so I rasa macam ada orang yang
yang yang yang very
nak nak pergi dia orang suka competition macam gini and all that stuff
untuk I kan suka competition but at the same time I cannot help but feel nervous before competition like I like there are people who love the competition and they just it it comes naturally to them like performing well at competition they like that competitive part lah
if I have one skill it will to be to just enjoy enjoy that competition take that stress yes but understand that you dah kerja dah dah dah dah train dah work very hard for it
I feel like you can translate the endurance into almost anything and everything that you do because what comes with the endurance is not only macam
bukan physical jer tapi
also dari segi mental
boleh tolong ah pasal
I rasa kan
so kalau kira I tengah buat
err example lah during err exam during exam period kira kita orang stressed dari like buat maths mathematics ke apa
kita orang boleh pergi main bola ke boleh pergi lari and all that stuff ni benda yang I rasa orang lain tak faham ah
macam dia orang kira oh
main sports like during that exam period is like wasting time and all that but dia orang tak faham yang like for people like us people yang selalu buat sports and all that
cause macam you do math then you are like wah
wah tak boleh ah tak boleh I cannot solve this question then you very stress
then you will like wah then you even more stress you you feel even more like lebih teruk
jadi like
I macam
I can okay there are times when I can read situation betul betul tapi
and like most sometimes it can be bad lah like with around my friends is okay you know because they know how I am and all that tapi kalau let's say in a setting with like older people or all that stuff
you know so kira you you I'm not the kind that will mince my words when I see something wrong
so I rasa like that's one thing that I can work on lah and that's something that I should work on
apakah sesuatu yang you
you nak
apa yang you nak yang you wish that would be free
that will be free of like free I mean not just free of charge dari segi wang tapi juga macam you don't have to work for it
like it just comes macam gitu
okay lah then we keep it to benda physical lah like macam yang benda monetary ah monetary
free untuk
because in my opinion macam
and macam you will feel very purposeless
like macam sekarang
kawan-kawan kita orang semua macam bosan tak tahu yang tak kerja lah tak kerja tak like training macam kita orang
dia orang macam bosan tak tahu apa nak buat then like I have had
ada lah orang yang bilang saya macam dia orang feel very purposeless tak tahu apa nak buat pasal sekarang dah habis exam kan abeh dia orang
tak payah belajar and all that stuff
okay lah you can make money from it also but in a larger extent you can also help to eliminate problems macam world hunger and all that stuff you know
it will help not only myself but it would help orang lain
satu hari macam in the future that will be that will be not a superpower but that would be something that well have like like you get what I mean like in the future you will probably be there will probably be like a machine or like just something small that you just press and you can just go to wherever you want
ya just because he's dia dia masih dia masih manusia macam kita orang
dia the the relentlessness the drive that he has
is what makes him macam different
macam he will not stop until
that he that dia dia
dia deems as
um not good lah so basically whatever he does is really untuk kebaikan orang lain that kind and he will like do anything for his family
the the the common pasal I baca comics kan the common like theme throughout semua yang semua
dia very rarely dia make mistakes
because dia selalu fikirkan betul-betul
buat ah kerja dia betul-betul make sure make sure that like he gets it right
but there are times when dia pun
apa tu dia pun makes mistake lah because he's human what so
oh carrying on with that because you know how batman selalu macam
kadang-kadang in like comic kalau you baca
so going off on those labels that like you you can think of for batman right what are some labels that you rasa
can be good can be bad you you just say lah apa-apa lah
a label tapi macam
it is an idea yang macam
kira okay so
that that label that oh he's a he's a very good runner therefore he can do he can run like apa-apa jer you know
I don't know lah I I do like you I macam plays a lot of
because you got all these outside influence kira then you
you know you get what I mean kira
I mean you said that sometimes it can be bad that's true it can especially when you are kira unfit for your standard and all that then people mentioned like eh how come you today like a bit slow eh how come like you look like you put on a bit of weight
kira it can be good lah
given your current life kan like kerja cause kita orang baru habis err exam
tapi like if let's say like five six years from now
lepas lepas lepas uni bila dah start kerja ah
to be fair I also macam I I feel the same way as you
your dream job you want to be physiotherapist and you say kalau
people you nak kasih dia orang apa yang you tak you tak ada
I I pun nak macam gitu tapi I rasa macam the one job that I would enjoy the most would probably be training
so like being a coach cause sekarang like I I already sort of do that lah kadang-kadang like macam
I go back to school then like I help some of my I tolong coach I
to like err ajar budak-budak yang baru masuk macam gitu lah
then I rasa macam
it will probably be pagi
they especially kalau lari kan so like morning will probably be an easy run
tengah hari probably another coaching session but in between probably lunch break or something can slot in like a gym session then after that like the coaching session this coaching session probably like just coach a bit
and then not much running probably macam benda technical and all that stuff which I can also do lah in that sense which would be better because in a sense kalau you are doing the drill or you are you are training with the rest of the team or like with your with your trainees
that would be and then that is like probably in afternoon then at night probably another training session in and stuff like that lah this is of course like you said assuming yang tak ada orang lain dalam apa tu dalam err my life lah that kind
I don't know I rasa macam I punya ideal life is very training centric
bukan bukan apa zina cakap pasal terrorists ini semua
and this is why dia shouldn't come in yet
okay kejap so dia orang actually sudah kenal berapa lama
dua tahun they know of each other for two years okay
oh habis yang budak ini dia duduk dekat yang the couch yang facing apa
ah dia duduk dia duduk dekat the mirror side lah yang facing the living room there right
so dia memang uh friend of a friend is it
tak tak penting ah
ya and then dia cakap
so dia dia kalau police dia kalau finish a certain number of years bond dia dapat yang bonus itu kan
he's and and so he's actually macam upfront and really just
apa yang susah sangat yang izat tak habis-habis yang macam cakap ah habis kau nak tanya dia punya gaji semua kau nak interrogate kan tak payah tanya budak ini sendiri cakap
eh merepek eh
so what happen you tanya first ah
apasal kena dekat istighfar eh
ya lah tapi pasir ris pun ada yang akan datang apa
nak cepatkan kahwin dia ah
he still thinks it it was the right thing to do itu ah
ya allah okay so oh tak tapi ini yang ini yang revise punya plan kan
yang mak dia cakap nak dua tahun kan tapi kalau tapi dia cakap ah the original plan
duh itu yang kita cakap kan
oh my god susah benda ini sudah jadi so complicated in the last three weeks
habis you tak tanya mm pasal kenapa nak kahwin sekarang tak tak tak tanya tu
zina pun nak kena grow up ah dua dua dua
habis budak itu tak cakap apa-apa at this mmhmm
grow grow up masing-masing
huh maksud apa
oh okay maksud dia macam dia cakap macam dia cakap lepas kahwin pun boleh grow up macam how zina puts it ah lepas kahwin pun can still do this
but I I don't know how much dia orang faham of this growing up thing I think macam fikir macam oh it's just about career future entah lah
mama duduk mana kat sini
mama dekat kitchen apasal mama dekat kitchen huh
oh habis
did you say macam jangan sembunyi-sembunyi did you say that
ah habis dia okay jer
macam dia the leader lah you can quite see that there will be the the nature
so memang dia dua puluh lima ah
entah lah
habis you tak tanya pasal dia punya family
oh I know the the dekat there okay ya I was there last time
habis zina macam mana dia punya reaction malu-malu ah tersipu-sipu ah
habis dia tengok macam alim-alim type tak
ini lepas si ashraf itu sudah balik ah habis
habis this is when
mm habis
habis then you say
supporting lah ya dayah yang kena support lah
ah habis apasal taxi driver
tapi dayah but oh my lord macam like
dayah is at the stage of her life that she's driven and macam have a lot of aspiration
habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia educated ke atau dia kaya ke at the end he's just going to be having this err aura of like macam relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah eh uh tak payah lah berbual pasal ini okay lepas itu
macam it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband lagi worse kalau dia have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character ke apa if he has it okay that macam he might ask dayah to stop working and things like that lah
habis so you just say that ah
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya dia nak kena match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand pasal
this whole like family who yang macam oh tahu benda orang orang I don't know family ke sesiapa ah yang rasa
oh lebih baik err halalkan percepatkan
macam as if macam itu ikut sunah nabi okay they take that part of the sunah nabi of marriage but the other part of the sunah nabi of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like macam your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody yang macam that macam is complementary to like your personality
mana boleh macam like that ah ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack err macam complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see macam that is the thing that orang just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part nak kahwin cepat macam oh ah ikut sunah nabi percepatkan but part part lain macam
to get somebody that is competent with you ini semua tak tak ambil kira ah
uh anyway this boy the call you abang or what
he should be comfortable with it lah dia ada kakak apa
oh so that's when he call you abang ah
so the conversation dengan zina err bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar it's more of like what what did you say to zina pasal yang the growing up and then pasal pasal making a apa plan habis pasal apa lagi like what else did you address
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this ah kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena wake up music just just just use this card
kata nak kahwin kan orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu tengok sampai perempuan agaknya she will just be fed up one day tapi betul apa macam
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect macam do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
easy go easy uh macam mana nak cakap uh ah apa
itu tak ada pendirian lah maksudnya
no macam gini the thing yang dia nak kena differentiate is ada bezanya easy-going dan tak ada haluan this is the thing zina you are which one
easy-going atau actually you are directionless
you said that ah untuk si ashraf ini ah habis ashraf cakap apa
ah budak ini pun tahu ke tak the background of zina
so this easily two years baru meet up tahu
I mean yes macam I am thankful and it's nice to know budak ini budak baik err so like what izat say kau tengok jer lah budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia
ya lah ya tapi I don't want after this izat say huh kau tengok macam aku cakap
dia budak baik I hope izat doesn't go like this lah ya but anyway
entah lah don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
sambil lewa anyway what I was saying okay
I really don't know lah this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes macam to
push zina tapi I don't know if at the end of this product is zina will be
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want macam at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all zina loses dia punya identity because this she is she is macam dissolving into a very
ah it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia see that I don't know lah sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if macam she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that macam you know like ah a woman shall be like macam be led by a man that kind of thing and
at because at some point there will be a point that macam she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
no it's not say tak lepas tangan it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse faham
macam because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself tau this twentieth uh twenty some age
but dayah said yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang denmark itu
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff orang punya personal is to us superficial
then you tak cakap macam dengan zina
at the end of the day zina dayah is still your sister macam you know she still cares for you lah then you know like
maybe she you tak cakap lah why why didn't you say to zina tadi like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu
then bila you cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini mama and abah was there habis
apasal you cannot chat ini
my why is my recoding still err okay you continue kejap kejap ya my recording is kind of
dia ah habis nevermind lepas itu then she say what dia tak cakap apa-apa
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to izat ever since macam she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
and just because izat is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue lah cuba kalau the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat will be supportive pasal apa
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that macam don't say that
you are macam ah tapi ah it's not that she will see all this point
habis if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
habis cakap you're close to izat pergi lah suruh izat tolong ah
budak ni segan silu wow
but that's because dia orang don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to tolong them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it lah
but it's hard lah I mean it's also vary in age age difference macam I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
oh you also cannot engineer it what salim like macam you cannot be bringing the two of them together
habis expect dia orang macam uh to boleh berbual like at a very deep level mana boleh like it will also feel it's so janggal macam it was so it was just feel so weird lah
okay kira sambung balik ah tadi soalan apa kau buat sampai malam ah semalam

tak tapi aku tahu cerita dia pasal apa ah
yang hot air balloon eh bukan hot air balloon macam balloon dia atas

ke rumah dia naik atas ah
javani ah tapi then like
dia nanti kadang kadang berbual pasal gini ah
dia kata breakfast lunch dinner semua is all social construct kan ah ah
there's only one in a few times ah tapi banyak kali macam
nanti kalau berbual dengan dia kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk dengan dia so macam kadang kadang aku macam just borak dengan dia macam biasa kan tapi kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk
abeh dia nya intellectual memang bagus ah macam entah budak budak soci semua gitu eh
ah macam fikir ah gitu macam dia macam that time pun kita discuss pasal
in macam different races in singapore ke tak payah macam gitu ah
ah habis kita cakap all the pointers macam actually tak payah semua
aku rasa kita kena ah
entah aku rasa tak tahu cause macam
okay maybe in the future then tak payah aku rasa in the future macam sekarang still kena ah cause
no ah macam sekarang terlalu awal macam I mean right now technically kau nampak orang kau dah tahu dia india melayu atau cina kan
in the future pasal aku rasa there will be like a lot of cross cultural nya marriage ah mixed
sampai kan dah terlalu banyak mix then dah susah
nak categorise so in the future baru macam tak payah categorise ah
ye lah ye lah
tapi macam
okay abeh kalau macam kau dah mix like
dalam kau ada lapan bangsa macam mana
ye lah kau macam macam one quarter ni one quarter tu one eighth
let's say let's say macam okay if your dad is like half malay half chinese then mak kau is like half indian half eurasian
ah bila dapat anak macam mana
alien eh tak
macam mana seh tu
then ah kalau race ikut bapa jer kan macam
it's not it's not accurate kan pada kau accurate ke aku rasa tak ah
and pada aku you shouldn't like ah
macam pelik seh I mean race is something like you're born with so kau tak boleh choose seh
construct ah ye lah
oh tak maksud aku
ye lah okay it's not fair cause macam
cause then mak dia punya side macam mana like
kira kan it's unfair for macam mak dia punya side ah
macam kalau the race just ikut bapa dia
let's say kalau race ikut bapa dia dia tak macam melayu tapi dia bukan melayu pe actually dia mix still mix what
then lagi satu apa tadi yang second nya
aku just rasa pelik tau macam you're born and then macam kau choose your race and then some people choose cause of nak dapat benefits ke apa ah tu dah macam
kau boleh choose to
ah betul lah tapi that time aku dengar macam kalau kau cina
err okay kalau kau melayu kan kau bila jual rumah
kalau boleh jual rumah to melayu atau india tak boleh jual to cina
ah potential punya customers sikit and then
and then cause of that kan the value of your house will drop kira kau sell at a lower price ah
tak lah tak lah ada satu word
as in oh okay okay okay boleh lah
yishun orang gila semua kat sana
kan actually betul pe tak eh yishun besar so
betul juga ah tapi ya lah like
kalau dorang buat a quota for private housing then
tak ramai seh melayu dengan india beli kan
kesian seh yang melayu kat situ
kau dah besar kau nak beli rumah apa
okay kalau kalau kau ada duit untuk beli condo will you buy a condo and will you stay in the condo
kira ambitious eh kau
macam sorang ah
oh macam macam gini eh oh okay okay okay okay
tak ada tak ada eh wait ada ada ah aku pernah hantar makan
kat those rumah
macam gini juga ah tapi mahal dia tapi mahal
ya mm pasal ada balcony okay dia dua tingkat dia tapi dua tingkat
ah all the units semua ada dua tingkat
sort of ah dia dia macam ah dua tingkat kan tapi atas is studio apartment
then kat bawah is like the living room and the bedroom ah so it's like macam
mm kira kau boleh overlooked the first floor kan ah cause
aku rasa government buat gitu pasal they want to encourage ah encourage families macam to live with their parents
so if studio apartment kat atas macam parents nya bedroom dengan
ada ada satu ah apa lagi satu pintu kat atas there's two gate satu pintu
ah then connected by tangga ah
aku ada ni ah aku ada sedara yang tinggal kat sana
tak ah
not nice ah dia nya studio apartment atas kecil gila
ya studio ah tapi not nice ah and then like macam pasal makcik pakcik aku da tua kan so like sometimes the whole day dorang kat atas jer tak turun bawah pun
cause everything is ah malas macam kaki pun sakit pe so tak boleh turun bawah
ya pasal dorang ada dapur kecil juga kat atas
ah then dorang nya living ah living room rak kecil and then bedroom dah
oh back to the question so kira kau nak beli condo ah
kira kau nak beli condo ah bila kau dah besar
ah seh aku pun
ya kalau ada macam gitu I I nak
I don't know ah I I mean aku macam tak nak beli private housing
for investment purpose okay ah tapi untuk tinggal tak ah
um aku nak aku punya kids macam
main kat playground lari lari
tak tapi aku nak more macam
not just playground kira dorang nak main bawah blok okay aku kasi dia main bawah blok lepastu dorang main dengan budak budak
ah at those area kan dorang punya kawan ah dorang main main
ah then ah gitu ah abeh
tinggal pun everything is dekat macam private property jauh sia serious serious ada yang macam jauh abeh like very secluded aku tak suka ah actually honestly aku prefer macam
kalau dia punya neighbourhood macam bising sikit
macam so kira macam best ah kecoh macam happening ah ya
ah bising tapi in a good way nya bising ah macam
budak budak semua main semua ah not bising
matrep naik motor perah motor lepak ah not that type of macam tempat ah
ya so kalau aku ada duit pun aku maybe tak akan beli private property ah
tak boleh ah aku just tak boleh ah macam

siri cakap dengan dia jangan interrupt lah

cargo siapa
oh toot too vroom vroom okay okay sorry sorry maaf
see see see my nose tengok hidung
ya I I ya semua kat rumah I yang tadi keluar
yang keluar breakfast
uh mister teh tarik is
uh apa eh
what why apa no
as in part uh like me lah apa
so you said so so you just agak-agak lah
sembarang ah
can see not tak nampak
ni I'm pointing at it ni
ah pukul dua belas
but then jurong west tak banyak shift ah
jurong west tak banyak shift
every time I check for shift right banyak kat sengkang
ya tak ada
kalau macam dapat degree or
that that that time my friend uh intern dekat vietnam then she she went to what what was it ah
I forgot I forgot ah it's it's uh apa beach area ah
singapore punya different
at ni ah ni pun ada apa malaysia
kesian ah
uncle janggut
then boleh cakap jepun
buy a kampung house over there
she's busy jaga ija
jangan ah
her like stomach area sakit
sakit perut also not sakit perut
then from the living room I pergi buka pintu for my mum
then I gostan a bit and see
cun-cun my mum also ah
come bagi salam asalammualaikum warahmatullah then I'm like mak mak mak mak tak tahu apa nak buat then her carry her barang pasar
but I don't know what she's doing now ah I think dia tengah baring tidur
main-main you see
uh what are all those memes people makan the pot
tak tak I should recommend this to
front load tak boleh ni apa
is it macam laundromat
macam mana nak hmm
ya that was back then lah but sekarang dah kena buang kan so tak ada guna ah nak tengok tu semua balik
so aku rasa lebih aman ah kat sana
ah saudi arabia ah mecca rasanya kat mecca sana semua
no aku
uh aku tak pasti ah apa pasal corruption ni semua tapi I did read over the news that uh ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself ah but then
amazing I would say sebab dorangnya taste
a bit different from asian nya culture dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit lah and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I will to get a chance to meet messi ah you know I like I mean both of us like to watch and play football right so if there's a chance I would want to go there and meet him ah tapi
disebabkan COVID period kan aku rasa no chance lah nak gi sana nak jumpa atau maybe kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada chance kot
maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau in singapore
so far aku rasa dorang dah main dah start main cuma it's just that no ah spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will ah suffer a lot of loss ah cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue lah
actually tu yang aku pelik ah but then uh I did make a research ah on the internet and I found out that uh they make money through uh fans memberships the merchandises like example err satu apa ni baju bola kan they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe what so kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover lah you know before the
ya aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat facebook apa semua especially in singapore err aviation macam-macam kerja ah ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya err kita tengok singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial ah aids to um singaporeans ah
ah tak lah sekarang aku rest jer kat rumah sebab uh apa to stay close ah with my family
sebab you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective lah but I would say it's hard lah ah you know to find a job that ah that is suitable with me tapi
ye lah aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit savings aku ah alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat save for the past err
months that I've been working as air steward kalau tak mungkin aku kerja lah cari mana-mana kerja
aku actually risau juga cuma
alhamdulillah again aku dapat save quite a lot
I mean aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau kan but then ya I would err the savings that I save
oh ye lah aku
aku baca hari tu kat facebook juga
ah apa kerja as a swabber is it they could earn like
maybe cause err they are finding people who are willing to work uh a risk a risky job lah tu pasal they are willing to pay that much
tapi to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer lah sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi maybe it's better if government pay them lah you know
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera lah you know tapi
nak cakap susah memang lah susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan kan jadi tu lah aku pun wonder on how singapore would cope with this um COVID nineteen lah
and tu pasal aku rasa penting lah untuk err ada plan lah untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada family atau beli rumah aku rasa
err you know a lot of children I don't know lah maybe for them it's a rezeki but in terms of singapore context
primary school children kan tak payah bayar school fees ke or maybe edusave bagi lebih banyak sikit ke you know
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this aku kadang-kadang pening ah sebab aku dapat gaji jer aku kena kasi
apa ni adik-adik aku eh sorry adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik kan aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar bill aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi ah then aku kadang-kadang barely aku cuma ada kadang-kadang five hundred for myself like in every month
so walaupun I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
I mean I sometimes I really wonder macam mana orang-orang yang err sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak lah you know rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar tau dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar bill
being raped which I'm totally uh angry about tapi tu lah aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk singapore mungkin kalau aku ironman mungkin aku akan pergi sana lah aku nak save dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa kan dorang ah
tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau err ye lah sedara kau sendiri
tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil I mean mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi
ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua I really
ya I really err I'm really disappointed that um the muslims are treated that way and also another case is sekarang ni happening in this world is
uh present representation of the whole community and as you can see in eh aku tengok err kenapa police dorang err
apa treat all those uh black people with such violence and brutality
where recently kalau kau tengok news err satu orang dorang siapa nama dia george floyd was killed
err aku tak tahu apa yang tak
police police tu fikir lah sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa err orang tu dia setakat err apa ni ada fake duit jer which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
err orang masih boleh you know kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa kan aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma
dekat sana ada this thing called bumiputera where the malays are given
wanted to buy this house at taman melawati lah you know in kuala lumpur or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
you have you don't have that bumiputera rights where you can
should be bersyukur you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually kan kalau dorang gi klinik they could actually
they uh dorang cuma perlu bayar one ringgit jer tau one ringgit for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
they err they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke I mean
okay ah berdosa tu dah another level dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat
duit eh rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
kapal apa yacht eh I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something wah that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister lah like that you know what you think about that
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and mesti dia akan dapat lawyer yang bagus-bagus ah and he might win the case and just uh go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years ah so
is a joke you know is a joke you know kau kau tengok ah kita punya uh how how well
actually actually memang ada tapi err
uh he he's called the yang berhormat speaker you know he's the man in the centre that uh will call on each uh each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
I really err you know in melayu ah they say kesian ah with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say eh speaker diam lah eh speaker apa ini you know they are very chaotic you know and
bro uh I don't find it weird ah cause sebab apa tau
all of the ministers actually ada fake degree you know he actually beli
di apa a fake degree on internet or something or apa eh dia suruh orang
pergi ambil degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something lah I mean memalukan seh kau
I mean kau dah tak
kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat kan sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus and
are recruited uh based on merit lah you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya aku aku happy ah macam singapore ada government yang stable ah walaupun ye lah ramai kata apa lah ni minister ni tak bagus lah minister tu tak bagus tapi
aku rasa kita nya government quite stable lah and aku happy to see that ya
eh actually aku terima soalan ni banyak gila ah dulu kan aku
aku fikir aku nak duduk malaysia the reason being is that
ah the peace and financial freedom mungkin sebab masa tu I mean still uh sampai sekarang lah aku masih kerja kat singapore kan and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted uh into the malaysian currency it's time apa times three apa so satu dolar tiga ringgit and you when you go there kau boleh spend apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa spa apa bagai and kau boleh buat apa-apa ah tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana
and kau kerja kat sana eh you might not be uh spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia ringgit example you are earning two thousand ringgit in malaysia
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik bus atau naik motor pergi kerja sini and okay lah mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
sebab ya the you know the okay example kau bangun pukul empat pagi then kau kerja sampai lima pagi and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam
and you know kau barely have time for yourself ah you know kau rasa kau akan do that for a long term or
you know try to spend two thousand ringgit in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand ringgit I mean
of course ah it's not easy for them I mean aku pun ada sedara kat malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in ah you know dalam kampung-kampung semua and um kalau kat singapore apa orang kata is it or gross income lah dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit
atau seribu lima ratus ringgit and
it's still tak cukup you know cause they are living in a dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang I mean mungkin barang-barang murah tapi
ye lah barang-barang lain macam bill makanan apa semua lah macam-macam and still tak cukup untuk dorang so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles ah so we cannot justify on what they are facing ah but kan in singapore itself it's very hard you know
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is haram
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore lah you know penting gila I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to tolong you to to uh you know to give duit I mean
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains ah birth rate in singapore is declining kan orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab
ya dorang risau kan apa tak uh tak ada tak cukup duit lah tak ada time and
aku tak faham ah kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada maid aku tak akan ambil maid untuk jaga anak aku sebab
I I want to be there for my own children I don't want to I don't want my child to be nurtured by another stranger you know I want to you know besar I want to saya aku nak besar kan anak aku dengan kasih sayang aku sendiri bukan
setakat kerja daripada pagi sampai malam balik tengok sekejap they don't know I want to be there for them
you know give them kasih sayang lah kau kau rasa tak pelik ke kalau anak kau you know dibesarkan dijaga oleh maid and maybe one day dorang tak kenal kau atau maybe dorang sayang maid lebih dari kau
gitu lah I mean
to have a to have enough money is very important lah singapore kan kalau kau
kau kau bayang kan kau spend
it's not even compulsory pun to have your own wedding
so yang penting I mean in our religion islam kita nikah dah cukup
tak penting pun then after that
ya I mean the the money that you supposedly want wanted to spend on your wedding right might as well you spend dekat kau punya rumah kau can pay lebih deposit
ya lah aku rasa rumah and uh duit um savings untuk anak kau lagi penting lah
I don't know ah okay sekarang sekarang err I'm in army kan so
ya I think sekarang sudah tak boleh tak boleh pergi
like you cannot go places a lot of places ah banyak banyak banyak tempat tak boleh pergi
atau dia punya ada limit
ada limit to entry ah
err kalau ah tak tak tak sekarang masih masih five juga
ah betul
mm bukan ah
I don't know but I think tengok tengok apa like orang lain yang instagram stories nampak
ada ramai orang cakap tak ada in the same venue tapi
so macam
ah macam pagi family then err petang just kawan-kawan dengan friends
oh iya ke
ah yours is ah that yang yang jemputan
ah evening semalam only semalam I posted about it

macam err
memang I don't keep myself up to date that much

I sudah tengok apa kebanyakan orang kan
okay kalau tengok in army in army
berbeza kalau compared to police dengan itu memang
macam for example pack

kalau nak belajar ya okay maybe bila kat uni kan uni kalau tinggal hall ke
okay uh kau nak start
aku join poly through which is the polytechnic foundation programme so from N levels supposed aku gi
ada ada minat ah so aku tak ada problem
eh tapi
aku tengah doing muay thai
dari silat then go squash
aku tak tahu is just
it's not my thing ah dikir barat
tak tahu ah aku rasa stage fright
then maybe because of that abeh dikir barat as I see is quite interesting ah like to watch not to do it yourself you get ya so
that's the difference ah aku sebab
err that is macam
macam tu aku fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school aku
uh sepak takraw pe so
that that competition macam orang tengok is normal
aku since young uh aku
not really sociable lah aku is a introvert ya
since primary school lah aku introvert so
but primary school lah aku still had this macam close friends so aku still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
still join takraw which is good and made a lot of friends there
okay that's the tough part sebab aku
aku didn't really got problem thus aku student counsellor so so aku tak boleh macam mess up lah so basically but the student council part also aku it wasn't
and then err dorang kira kan
sebab aku really from a
aku considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor lah in sec two ya
aku actually tak nak sebab aku just just malas ah then so uh the funny thing is
aku didn't even go for the interview even though I had to lah
dorang dorang naik dekat uh assembly hall panggil aku dorang tanya err
okay aku cakap ah I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say oh you got duty today then I'm like what
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya nanti ada orang hantar aku
go to sick bay nanti aku cakap stomachache and all that
guilty tak sangat right ya then
but to be honest aku rasa dorang tahu lah tapi dorang just macam
macam okay ah can just go just go
aku first job aku was uh burger king which aku finds
so aku just join and then they quickly like train me
after staff day takde lagi
kind of lah because dorang macam err kira kan
uh business kecil so uh
macam referral kan so aku kerja
I think aku dapat thirty forty
kau kerja is a different environment
so kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam some ah a'ah macam gitu just at some park or some event
eh apa dah kerja
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about sebab aku lagi prefer hands on
rather than macam
so next year kita dua gi internship
you quite excited ah untuk shore
uh aku
so aku gi belayar second sem
which is exciting ah untuk aku sebab aku pun join sebab dia punya sailing the part
exciting tapi
scary juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam
sebab aku pun planning uh
aku start family and all that so ya
even though internship kau dapat shore kan
aku rasa there's still a chance untuk kau sail in the future you know macam kalau kau still carry on with this career then aku rasa why not kau ada dia punya diploma kau ada experience
takyah disappointed sangat
kau stuck at shore
yes sebab untuk aku err
aku rather sacrifice
aku punya time untuk uh
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine macam
ah exactly jadi untuk aku macam it's worth it lah kau go for six months
then got free for like like three months gitu three or more then
macam by the time aku reach macam tiga puluh empat puluh is
even workshop takpe sia fun so
aku suka ah
honestly following the trend kan aku rasa aku
we'll probably be posted to firefighting tapi personally aku nak army
ya sebab
aku tak tahu ah aku just
aku ada interest in the armed forces juga
kira the army navy ataupun air force ah
tapi firefighting pun untuk aku okay
tapi aku really tak nak
um macam dari dari kecil
aku main bola bawah blok ke apa kan atau aku gi skate ke apa nanti dorang datang screen abeh
ya and then since young aku had that uh
image of them macam dorang just
datang sini screen screen macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah
err aku pergi seven eleven beli maggi apa kan aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang screen check check EZ-link semua aku don't find it
macam practical lah macam kau just kacau aku kan at this point ah so I never really had the interest for police
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag aku
maybe dorang check rokok ke apa abeh aku
aku just found it like like weird lah to be honest like until now also I still feel
I I take it personally ah sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at nanti dorang tengok aku
dorang tengok eh kadang-kadang dorang panggil and dorang check bag aku macam just
but ya that's why aku tak nak police
then kau
eh tapi air force
macam mana nak cakap eh
macam ada engineering punya part ada communications punya part
I because to be pilot also susah
kalau dorang offer kau untuk macam uh continue
posted to air force eh kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam
I think boleh tau sebab the thing is I went for the
ah ada dorang macam test kau punya
so macam
err aku betul-betul nak so
months before that kan aku aku practice with this movie so aku aku tengok youtube video
aku take online test
unfortunately aku tak dapat ah dorang tak bilang score
sebab dia ada aku rasa eight to ten different tests
uh ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah
honestly overall aku rasa aku did not bad
ya so tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat
okay obviously kalau ada
aku aku definitely would
honestly kalau
the job areas like engineering atau uh communications
kalau pilot lah who don't mind
sebab dia punya cockpit dia ada dia punya ah
aku tengok macam national days semua kan nanti ada dia punya jet like cool lah untuk aku
sama sama sama six years
so macam aku untuk aku primary school is when you develop your own uh character
sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku primary macam the most important
but ya primary school aku is uh
I think to through sepak takraw also
err develop aku punya own personality
is aku
I'm a quite macam quiet person
jadi aku dalam class pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual
err tapi bila aku join takraw baru aku macam
uh jumpa orang-orang ni semua and
I was quite good at it ah sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw
and then the coach was the one that macam kira recruit aku
through my brothers ah dia dia nampak aku dia cakap eh join ah join ah takraw
then then uh aku join and then
and then err it was funny ah sebab aku was
coach aku pun macam confident aku boleh main
I think by primary four aku managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four aku the captain at junior team and then primary five aku captain of senior team
ya ya that's why dari situ aku macam belajar macam this leadership roles
macam macam mana nak uh
sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku ah kat sekolah
kalau aku tak buat homework pun dorang macam marah
primary school was fun lah cause of takraw I mean
sebab kalau kalau err
tapi depending on tekong kalau dia left hand ke ya
uh kadang-kadang
and then if the tekong is left legged then feeder nak kena belajar campak
atau striker
tapi aku lagi suka striker
takraw was fun lah tu tu pun macam mana aku macam
belajar ah the
sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk nationals
queenstown primary tak pernah dengar
tapi queenstown secondary ya
oh sebab aku rasa
okay aku remember primary five
against err since the first round kita
kita beat every school
the west zone okay so kita east zone err
uh school ada east north uh west dengan south
jadi kita dari east zone
jadi kita meet all these different schools yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita beat them ah
err using basics kita tak ada macam fancy fancy semua tapi coach kita ajar macam betul-betul master your basics
kita beat all these schools from
ya tapi aku
surprisingly national that time primary five kita beat dorang juga junyuan ya so kita macam kita ada this momentum ah which starting sampai finals kita tak kalah
uh menang qihua
second team kalah
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win ah untuk champions
so macam every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus ada nama ni semua but never tampines north primary school
a'ah sia aku nangis rabak sia tu
aku really felt the responsibility ah
sebab kita punya vice principal kat situ
but the tampines north tak pernah achieve this kind of achievement
wait delta league apa
think macam
so aku
abeh aku nampak that time kau post kat instagram macam
dorang still cakap apa boys become last at least
dorang shouldn't macam just celebrate because you get at least fourth macam dorang should celebrate the change you know
wah takde love life lah okay tinggal macam four minutes
aku attached
aku jumpa dia through
dia pergi cambodia
okay so total sec two that time ada macam
ya boleh click ah so
but that time sec three uh dia suka orang lain
ah tapi aku don't mind sebab
just find her pretty you know macam I can
oh ya aku okay then
relationship dia tak work out
so ini hari we will be talking about corona virus
err in Singapore and how so far kita kat sini at home and uh my family semua how we've been coping
err with all the jobs and all the um confinement semua kat rumah
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how I've been interacting dengan all my friends lah basically
bila we heard about all this um
corona virus thing err dulu back then I was somewhat employed lah
terus um when I heard about it at first err it didn't seem like such a big deal lah because um
people over there were quite err rilek they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
err maybe it won't be as such a big issue lah tapi after that when I came back um
I was given a couple of mask tapi I thought like okay lah not really necessary but err eventually it turns out that
so that time bila we saw it on the news err my my girlfriend's uh auntie lah so dia kasi
uh because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only macam ten masks or so something like this
habis um ask us to use it err when we are at the airport sebab err who knows kan especially Indonesia agaknya maybe
not so safe lah and then err so I flew back I still wear the mask uh at first I thought macam too much ah actually macam maybe
kat station pakai mask habis um some of them err they there was no form of social distancing ah back then so there was no such advice but
mask ada quite a number of people they were wearing it lah and then um they decided to
eventually err make an announcement on and said that dia punya mask ini semua actually not mandatory lah at first then cakap only kalau macam you sick err you stay at home
err just jaga yourself lah there's no need to go out um and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
um slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt banyak orang orang macam didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe err eventually um it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic lah habis Malaysia orang Malaysia affected orang Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to macam got on the list lah
ah so at first we were the first habis
err in Euro and then slowly got to America and now sekarang kan kita in a state where um
employed habis sekarang macam like looking for job because uh
how about your experience macam mana you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think siapa siapa anyone lah was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted banyak um even home based business at some point was err affected kan
uh that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less macam slammed her
ya but err because of what she said a lot of people macam tak satisfied lah diorang macam
um kena pulau rabak rabak lah basically because of her statement she even
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or niat dia the niat is there lah tapi macam
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good macam nak tolong all these regulation issue ah
tapi sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay lah I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
tapi because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is um what she should have done was
after she did it and of course nak return balik dia punya statement susah kan but at least macam just go out there and just apologize properly
tapi she chose to macam go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
and err some of them are funny macam the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend Hadi because okay to be fair sebab
habis he will macam ah be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants cuma bike is slightly different lah
like the first time I saw it macam this could be Hadi
it could really have been Hadi the way they dress dia punya seluar dengan dia punya helmet dia punya visor
uh unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but uh I think a lot of people macam does really
um macam it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite uh positive feedback ah about the guy dia super extra ah
and um while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large tapi macam it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say macam this guy this mat just naik motor habis just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that dia macam very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
err the first tak salah Deliveroo was to start all this tapi in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something lah
but what I really feel about food delivery is dia macam quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second ah about Grab drivers err not Grab drivers
people who are do food delivery all this kalau they really macam really work hard macam chiong all the way ah macam maybe eight hours chiong all the way macam Hadi for example kan
um they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on macam mana they hit dia punya incentive or macam mana they hit dia punya
um hours or dia punya right timing ah because all these riders kan macam dorang dah experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right kedai mana um
prepare food quickly kedai mana prepare food very slow they know how to play the game lah basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize macam your delivery ah
to the upper income group because macam especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery macam ya macam every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars uh or something ah per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people macam err  beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
no much prerequisite lah maybe if you macam nak deliver naik motor kan then
ah kena pakai lesen you have to prove your lesen lah but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview err macam documentary lah don't know on Grab and how err some of the handicap people
um they managed to get jobs in Grab macam dulu um when they before Grab kan macam there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say macam if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes tapi ada orang macam down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know macam is like a big macam beban
duduk kat rumah jadi beban jer puas hati macam you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this uh girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair lah
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver lah maybe satu hari deliver four or five items lah for example
so macam berdikari lah so instead of
the interface macam the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
err it it simplifies the task basically pergi sendiri pick up pergi sana drop off so it it it gives this
admin position or something macam kena interview tak tahu pass ke tak err your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless macam kalau too saturated or something lah there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
um the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how uh blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers punya salary
err I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate macam
you you don't get err you don't get denied err okay selalunya the idea is when you do the employment kan err you cannot be judged based on your I don't know err race or
so macam for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so err nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah so when you're tired you get home
so that so called keep them motivated lah whereas macam delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
and you don't have that burden of oh hari ini kena buat sepuluh delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
ah yes okay definitely lah so basically macam you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars err what you get
is um basically is through the app punya interface ah so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours lah
it's it's already a net amount dorang already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off err because sometimes
for example um whatever the food is dorang dah minus the food amount so err this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
terus err whatever is shown in your phone macam you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example ah that's yours lah basically
you are okay let's say you are riding habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan
oh tak ee I still got to go on I need to hit um ten deliveries today or uh I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
and how it is a good way for people macam let's say they have spare time ah macam let's say they work nine to five
habis malam macam they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then err just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
err ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus tapi sekarang dah starting so much on delivery
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to buku letak kat tepi
what sort of err security feature or identification yang dorang implement
kan risau
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already macam kirim salam ah
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle lah but you think that you are macam everything dah okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project kerja just to survive on the salary from that job
um but I kudos to you lah memang is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
or Facebook ada politics pe sekolah pun ada politics pe but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
in school walaupun you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever belajar but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that macam there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying macam nak enjoy susah
tapi okay it it depends on people right so um
two major popular universities that they went to is either or eh so macam sekolah so basically you study throughout the whole year
whereas for the one that I went to basically err buat project
err it it it becomes like what uh eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent kat belakang exam
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent tapi kalau you have macam ada solid group you can work with
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours ada project kan
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to macam all these budak budak they still have not have a taste of full life macam full working employment yet
that's why I think a lot of my friends yang um went to you uni SIM basically err university
night university lah so dia orang juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life ah there's no more social life basically
err pagi pagi daytime you go to work and then err malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time nak buat err nak buat group assignment nak study untuk exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
ya there's a lot of compromise err and you have to be willing to macam at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social lah because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
no lah at first to be honest ah at first bila all this thing happen kan macam um it's interesting err because is something novel
macam is not common apa dulu to to um communicate through okay maybe for you lah but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family tapi when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
err at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime uh kerja err in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward macam I think it depends on people also lah because ada orang ada orang boleh focus when they're at home
or the bed sleep lah take a nap during lunch time tu semua for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas kalau macam kat tempat kerja you've got to drag your ass and then
they switch into mode you know macam home mode err duduk kat rumah macam
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing punya mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is macam all wax style and then
ah you know you're wearing clothes um and then you go out and eh you you just have that vibe macam I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know macam when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in um I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in dia punya scheduling and stuff like that tapi
macam dekat rumah you can just eat macam you can snack and all that shit err but kalau kat luar uh macam you need to walk for it and uh I don't know
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you err do delivery uh I think the so called delivery fee is about macam four dollars something like this kan
and you can actually see they have macam those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package tak salah is err
no it's like a pass lah it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's apa macam limited edition kan tapi it's actually has been around for awhile
oh well people still deliver food a lot of people still macam still work from home pe banyak orang work from home pe sekarang lah
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while sampai sekarang
fishy ah the Russian punya vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three what
entah eh
entah lah
well kalau at the end of this year dapat pergi dapat pergi Malaysia pun I'm quite happy already to be honest
all the other countries at least dapat pergi somewhere within their own country kan so Malaysia even Malaysia or Indonesia
even though their borders are closed at least boleh pergi Penang dapat pergi um I don't know
for one of the islands Perhentian islands or something you know Sentosa nak pergi Sentosa Sentosa ada apa kau dah kenapa
if itu bukan itu bukan dia ini tau is not like dia pergi by himself dia pergi ikut err the diving punya tour thing
you still can go pulau hantu now actually
now that I got all this part time job at least macam my sleeping schedule is a bit better
tidak before that I was sleeping macam pukul lima pukul
empat it was ugh didn't like it is too late I forever young what you talking about man I'm you're only as old
tapi it's not like exclusive for
thirty more seconds kita kena clap eh lepas ini or
habis just stop jer
okay tak apa tak apa tak apa uh it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now
okay boleh dengar
kalau tidak nanti it becomes distorted
okay okay then aku adjust
the boundary ah okay aku baru pasang
okay lah aku tak buat salah ah macam I I don't see
I wouldn't penalize myself uh just now ah maybe yesterday okay lah because yesterday aku macam kaku sikit because I didn't ride for very long right
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to lah but aku dah datang lambat semalam
semalam aku tak lambat so
then he started the face like macam
tahu macam oren penyet punya kan looking not happy like that so I was like okay lah I tell him I said okay I got experience like that uh uh kau experience kat mana aku cakap dulu I oh okay somebody go ask sampai back berapa then like uh
empat ke lima ah after second assessment
oh okay okay this one not for you go that one dia cakap macam tu
and obviously I I kept stalling like I um not midway but I kept stalling at that place yang you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so dia macam when I'm moving then dia stall stall stall gitu
I don't see anything wrong with it lah macam they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that aku bawa maybe thirty five ah thirty or thirty five ah it break dia punya speed ah
so the the problem was uh okay that that was yesterday so aku faham
I made less than less than ten rounds ah it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was um dia cakap okay uh he put two people out
tak nak lah
fact ni cakap I didn't even stall today macam because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice kepala otak dia lah need more practice at least you come and tell me macam maybe I did something wrong maybe aku terlalu laju or aku macam maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know ini macam guessing game you know or not like oh I asked him I asked me just now I said oh actually what what went wrong like
wah tadi kau okay uh everything okay breaking okay tak macam semalam cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
oh takde apa-apa kau just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking kepala otak kau kau pun every prac kau pegang motor ke sama juga kan it's the same it's the same model what it's the same bike what what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated lah at that point of time then I just ah ya you know sudah lah
but tapi dia punya failure aku faham because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really tergolek you know rabak ah
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about ah okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not yang belakang yang that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan admin punya side
time belok
dia turning ah ada cornering ah so
I was in front of her so aku bawa okay everything semua okay so I already made one round already
and then the instructor pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror lah but I won't speeding I won't because that part memang you have to go down to get to that turn what
then aku belok sekali ada eh
because the other places where you turn ada orang it's quite open but that particular corner is is is ha memang seclude you cannot see anything there ah
ha then the instructor was like uh apa kau buat lagi alamak dia cakap macam tu kan then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop ah stop and wait
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left memang tak boleh lah of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you ah I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that ah so I guess takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say eh sorry eh kalau in your way I say nevermind it's okay lah you just
just do your thing ah then the instructor go and tell her some more you know ha masa dah buang ni lagi
she likes to macam himpit to the left side
so no she probably got so close and after that she gabra because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
ha badan dia pula was on the other lane
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia
and then after that uh she was trying to start the bike ah kelakar cause when she fell kan I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then apa she said eh uh I think my motorbike spoiled dia cakap macam tu and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled dia ingat spoiled dia try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik one you cannot hear the engine starting ah
alamak how ni eh gini gini gini then he go there he said this one your switch your switch ha check your switch okay
then dia begin
takpe uh number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake takpe takpe takpe I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one ah so after that sampai habis
so I was just riding and riding and riding macam no problem lah to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one yang pakai bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying ah tall guy malay
muka dia macam mat sial sikit dia dia was on the he was on the he was at the bend yang depan lagi before you turn back into the the the admin area dia jatuh part sini kira square
macam ni kan admin area kat sini kan dia ada tempat sini si instructor lagi satu dia lepak sini the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed kau nak brake buat apa you're already breaking already what I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
macam you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice ah turn and like salah salah kau kena brake lagi kau kena brake lagi brake brake sebelum kau down gear brake kau nak brake apa lah siol so
at that point of time the more he talk the more aku peng ah but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three tudung girls in his class
tapi dia orang baru nak keluar ah so
aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa ah just want to start one again ya I guess normal leh you know whatever lah eh
for me lah as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong dia suruh aku main one two one two one two three aku one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
ha plank plank quite senang what
but I still remember two B in seven seconds tak salah aku is fast lah let me class to you have to go thanks again eh
ya I saw I saw it uh tak salah aku nampak dekat mana eh
you don't upgrade now lah dol you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten ke something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once kau dah
confident once kau rasa macam you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike ha that is five six years later you you change ah you don't have to macam oh I get class two sekarang juga aku nak tukar ha
but ya um then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the lampu
four bottles mampus mampus
ya lah because you got to change it frequently apa
have what ah three ten is is pendek what
but you can lower the expansion you the zontes three ten can lower down the expansion yes but zontes three ten cantik sia
the yang one ninety
the the the the apa the capacity capacity I think is
dia punya tank eh dia punya tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
ya but the thing is a zontes kalau let's say misal kata if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike mampus ke apa ke kat sana bro I'm dead sia
that's why you never go jauh-jauh I mean you went to malacca once right
ya lah you common bike boleh ah you you use all this kind of funny sounding bike even continental yang tak kira asia tak popular punya mampus kalau motor kau mati
oh kira macam gitu siala
habis ah
malaysia boleh
but imagine if you're like stuck in I don't know negeri sembilan ke apa
kena jaga ah
aiyo kena bully ah
but if you tolak means kena bawa perlahan ah very slow ah
sticky situation macam mana
no but kau boleh brake juga apa
dulu punya trend eagle apa ha
wobbly ah lepas tu jatuh ah
kira dia orang semua members ah
time tu your father belum kahwin ah
masih bujang lapuk ah
tapi it's just dangerous sia
oh ya ya ya I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard belum lagi after
speaking of of of of this part tadi um
there was this guy I don't know I got tell you or not tadi ada satu he was on the mini circuit ah
a'ah sia basically the bike is is basically the the the wall like this but he went up and then he was still he was still turning bro on the bike whack everything first kena the plastic barrier after that ah already dah ada bunyi like gitu broom gitu then after that
then he continue moving bro so the wall was here and then his bike was there the wall his his bike was rabak sial
aku tak tahu but after that he stop kaki dia sakit
here he cannot climb between after when he when he so called fell the bike was lying on him he bike was lying on him and he was sandwiched between the bike and the wall then dia macam I cannot ah I cannot
aku macam alamak
then the instructor the instructor just like eh nevermind you all continue continue macam tak apa-apa gitu nevermind nevermind you all continue and then he go he he came out lah to pull the bike one side then ask him you okay or not but I think after that he didn't didn't continue
I do not know but I I know dia cakap pasal after that's he walk he was limping
sakit juga siol sakit juga

okay ah first kita berbual pasal regarding our hobby lah okay ah so you can first what is it your hobby
cakap lah macam okay example like kalau for me my hobbies is ah I like to read books I like to travel I like to
ah mostly spend time dengan kawan-kawan ke apa ah that is my sort of hobbies that I like
ah I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai I don't really like it
punya brand tak ada you don't have any other brand yang you suka ke apa ke
kan and I think you also suka Coach
you pun suka
ah quite lately lah I think that daripada dulu pun you memang suka Coach if not just lately
ah so apa lagi yang you
you apa you minat selain daripada bags
okay because for me ah whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore kan pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak
we apa more like
terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu kan so
important the family makan and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa it's edible lah boleh makan and there times yang you masak pada I is
uh fantastic lah it's good juga lah kan
takpe lah the more the more rounder become most to most
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore nak main bola dah susah I I try to ask my friends to play all
with sharif if the kid maybe can can be done ataupun
I think in terms kalau
ah the whole society punya makeup pun dah changed I think now we are
kalau kalau passion the thing is passion is there
budak-budak cuma only have
to ah play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is lain
kalau sekarang ni when people play is
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if macam
now like dulu kalau kita nak tengok internet pakai computer will really stay in front of the computer
tapi now even with handphone
kan contact the people pun
tak ini lah so the
itu lah the changes in in time eh so in order to survive
ah mentality zaman dulu punya kan tak nak handphone tak nak pakai
ah internet kan I think kalau sekarang ni if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
ah I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be apa terlalu ke belakang if let's say we are too far
have to have to try lah kan tu kadang-kadang when we try pun
susah juga nak nak catch up kan but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that lah kan okay sekarang nak
berbual pasal apa topic lain
kita takde lah travel banyak-banyak tempat kan ah so for our travel is mostly to
ah if not we will be like apa every year at least lah
I think bila kita pergi tu apa boleh
so hope macam apa we can
so biasa lah pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa lah
what are the ah pattern what is the perangai yang kita boleh
ah click atau tak click what is our
err kalau bawa
ah apa
ah yes lah you can ke depan lah
takda lah at least kan
ya when we first sampai the hotel tu
kan bila kita sampai
bilik tu macam okay everything go like so olden
kan ah ah so after lepas dah the bilik tu okay lah but overall
so sometimes kan you have to buy kadang-kadang macam apa
because ah dorang tak jual
so that's why kadang bila kita when
dorang beli to sell at their shop ke apa kan
nak pergi ah
itu bukan itu aja even someone who
to kasi duit
then dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua kan ah
itu lah kan so other than that
ah indonesia juga bali juga
and your dengan best friend you ah
down there pun our friend is a hindu kan
boleh tahan kan tapi dia punya
ah hotel ada sikit ulu lah
ah kan ah pendalaman
tak kotor sangat tapi to me is ah
kotor juga lah kan
ah big buses tak boleh jalan ah um
in terms sana another thing I remember pasal bali tu pasal kita apa
yang sebelah atas tu eh
gunung apa eh gunung eh
ah gunung tu it was fun lah
basically macam atas tu sejuk it's like going to genting highlands
ya cantik memang cantik but the place tempat makan tu it's like all the buildings
so I wonder ni selamat ke nak duduk sini
kan ah I remember going to the toilet pun it's like
ah like a ghost movie punya punya toilet masuk
dekat situ nampak eh toilet ni senyap jer kan tapi pasal nak kencingnya pasal kan nak kena pergi
pergi jer lah kan but luckily it's only me lah I think if he want to go
kita just duduk and talk
ah a'ah near the swimming pool there so talk dengan raja
so ah nasib baik tu satu jam eh
ah banyak juga lah topic boleh berbual takde
we don't clear all macam apa nak cakap apa we talk
ah kita apa
um ya dia datang kita punya wedding a'ah
kan kita travel dengan dia eh quite a few ah kita pergi penang dengan dia ah
banjir ah
yang bestnya pergi rumah P ramlee tu dia punya
a'ah sikit-sikit lah tak semua lah
uh huh kita respect lah
dia kawan ah P ramlee dia kawan P ramlee dia pernah hidup dengan P ramlee lah so roughly dia tahu P ramlee punya sejarah tu macam mana
jambatan bridge ah
sekali pergi ah he got fear of heights
pusing gitu jer uh huh um um
komtar penang tapi itu pun apa apa macam
ya so dorang tutup that one is the
even the penang chief minister pun ah minta tolong dengan
party kan so it's that bad lah kan tapi
memang nasib kita baik lah kita dapat pergi
but I remembered lah yang kita pergi sana tu
mana-mana kita nak pergi tanya flood ke tak flood ke tak kalau dia kata um ah longer way uh huh
so macam kalau apa even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building tu di apa
a bit macam odd lah something good
kan kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia
food museum then there is the upside down museum ada the three D three D museum ah basically is the
basically is err apa taking pictures
punya opportunity lah tapi kalau nak kata museum macam gitu
upside down museum I think dekat singapore pun dah ada upside down museum ah so nanti mungkin kan kalau with the apa
then kita boleh pergi lah upside down museum ah
ini bukan apa ini is so called macam apa lepas gian
kan nak travel tak dapat dekat singapore kita boleh lah buat aje lah
boleh enjoy ke tak itu lain cerita lah kan bab kita a'ah the fans ah our friends pun ada kat sana kadang kita travel pun kita suka bawa our friends kan ah itu lah that's the good part about apa
travelling lah kan ni dah tak travel and the thing is ah dah tak travel tu satu hal then with this COVID nineteen
a lot of restrictions tak boleh lebih daripada lima orang ke apa kan abeh kalau nak kawan pun dia empat orang
kita tiga orang dah dah lebih kita tujuh orang kan so is susah juga lah kan hopefully tengok ah hopefully the COVID nineteen punya apa
vaccine can be found nanti kita boleh go to phase three maybe phase four kan
um macam bosan juga lah kan kalau kita kita pergi mana-mana just kita kita nak mingle with other people pun susah kan
ah so that's why kalau kita keluar
kita pakai glove kita pakai mask kan ya lah pakai glove ah
ah touch anywhere kita pakai glove kan kita pakai disposable glove
kita pakai disposable mask anything disposable kita pakai lah to prevent from all these ah
bag tak boleh disposable kalau beg disposable
ah cari topik lah kan
okay for me kalau dua puluh dua puluh satu my wish is kan ah
okay lah anak kita pergi sekolah agama he is able to cope
ah then other than that ah hopefully rezeki kita bertambah lah
ah apa tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people pun move other parts of this one is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family pun move kalau kita punya situation kan and got a kid
to jaga kan to jaga we got a special needs adik to jaga kan so but okay lah I think it can be done lah it will be difficult sacrifice perlu dibuat kan cuma hope to apa
hope lagi banyak benda kita boleh
kita will work out lah kan
the vision is clear kan ah our vision is clear kan of course kalau budak susah nak faham kan
ah tapi kata orang pun kita lead we lead kan most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out kan so kalau macam
of course lah kadang ada orang selfish apa kan so if
that person selfish tak nak cooperate kan
I will do it lah tapi kalau dah tak boleh kan
kau get into masalah
kau suruh aku handle aku I feel tak
tak ini lah tak apa tak adil tak adil kan so I will always go for fairness
leher ah
yes the neck tapi macam the neck only can show where to turn
kan tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang decide nak turn atau tidak
ya kan so sebab itu kita as a keluarga we are as a unit kan so we want to move we want to move as a unit
kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini kan then kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat
affect tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah then
really have to apa explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue lah kan so the issue now is whether dapat settle ke tak
tak tahu hopefully akan dapat settle lah kan
dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal lah kan I don't want to halang
kalau dia nak kan kita akan we are
in terms of nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap lah kan
tergantung it's very susah lah then
semua dah buat kan
kan kata orang tu kan
but now the organisation bukan satu tempat
they are two different organisations so yang ini tempat check
ah masa depan
for future yang ini untuk apa
ah dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain so
whether it will improve ke tak
tak juga dia different criteria kan like example kalau macam
ah apa in order to apply for example ah to apply for need
ah certification that he is autistic then dah pergi minds minds dah certify dia dah ah settle
then after that nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula oh
certification from uh minds tak cukup
ah doctor lah doctor or hospital or what okay so pergi doctor punya hospital
happen doctor hospital tu pun ah okay lah willing to help okay he did that part
then after that bila nak apply for apa for apa cash in life for home caregiving kan oh
cannot we only we only accept those who are apa
risiko there and the the thing is
okay lah macam cakap macam macam kita ni
macam for macam untuk adik ni
I am willing to usaha kan and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support lah
so kita kena buat kan tapi macam you try imagine
kalau lah all these checks
yes correct and the thing is pula
kita pergi check up ni bukan free
everytime pergi
ah kena bayar ke apa kan but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds tolong
percuma free
ah even the hospital one happen epilepsy punya doctor kan so there is no extra charges lah and
ah so nanti Q cure ni kalau macam apa
in order dah dapat cash in life lah apa ni semua cash in life lah pula nak kena assessment kan
and then the assessment pun need another set of ah check up
kan lah so memang susah lah tapi
ya lah duit apa
kita bukan harap ah ah at least dia improve
istimewa ah uh huh
I think for him is my target for adik is apa
kan kita bukan I'm not expect bukan expect dia boleh
pandai kan macam harapkan dia apa dia dapat
he can enjoy kan of course dia punya enjoy not
macam kita macam kita enjoy oh kita nak jalan kita nak travel kan dia punya tak dia punya enjoy tu
simple something that dia suka
dia feel comfortable sudah kan
ya lah tapi kata orang tu apa ye lah cuba kalau mana tahu kalau dia improve kan
dia punya epilepsy dapat
ah which is now supposed to be terkawal ah kan tapi
tu yang payah dia lah susah dia kan um um um um
ye lah proper food um um um um
budak-budak ya
tapi orang tak tak pandang dia begitu orang treat dia macam apa
tapi tu lah macam kata orang tu apa
treat adik with respect lah walaupun dia istimewa kita make him part of us kan janganlah lebihkan orang luar
abeh anak sendiri pun treat
macam apa kan kita try to make eh dia suka apa kan
bother to find out apa yang dia suka apa yang dia tak suka
apa yang dia comfortable apa yang dia tak comfortable kan
ah bukan setakat
ah apa marah ke apa marah
kan dan dia pun tak tahu apa yang dia buat salah kan kita susah nak
nak cakap kan
mengganas ah
dia tak dengar lah ah ah
um tapi tu lah
kita cuba jer lah kan hopefully everything goes well
hopefully is a better year hopefully boleh travel
kan mungkin short trip dulu
ah bawa adik sekali
ah dapat duit banyak kan gaji
jadi kita boleh apa boleh do
banyak benda yang baik lah bermanfaat bukan sahaja untuk kita
tapi untuk orang lain sekali ah for now
so macam bud okay
but then how they make money in the first place kau tahu tak
ya I think there are people who like macam every three weeks they will go for a haircut
wah if I wah cannot afford ah rabak seriously
the haircuts lah I just go to normal neighbourhood barber shops like bawah block punya
and the pakcik will cut your hair and it's really I think that's more comforting ah cause cause I see all these young people do ah and then the places
that they make the shop that they make ah is very intimidating you know you know like sometimes you takut you know you'll be like
eh what's this ah why they all this abang-abang like
then the pakcik will be like eh ah sekolah eh
then like oh sekolah ke kerja then like oh kerja ah oh ni
wah gila eh thirty days
ya but to me it's a very weird weird experience ah cause for us singaporeans cause we we always lepak what like every weekend we always see each other we are lucky to be in singapore where where things are like small then we can travel everywhere within one hour then we also have our own friends that we always hang out with
but then sekali kena the circuit breaker
cannot lepak lah cannot do this cannot do that lah but then we still lepak at zoom ah so is uh I don't know ah it's very it's very weird feeling I hope
semangat lah want to still want to lepak cause I know is is ah very very difficult for other people also ah those who no got no support from friends during this circuit breaker wah that one rabak that one sure rabak
then some more if you stay in a family then you don't like the family I mean your family everytime gaduh everytime quarrel wah that one more more worse sia that one
like they jaga everyone lah like
urgent matter why why so long macam tak jam jer

tapi okay
hari tu dekat rubik's jam
abeh dorang book
apa sia
have to bungkus ah
bungkus ah
ya no lah but the reason why this band is easy to tour in the first place remember macam zad err freelance zafran also
trying to kumpul duit ah to buy gear to for live setup
so that the reason why aku selalu form band pasal aku suka pergi tour
pasal kalau kau pergi tour you get to see the world
like#zad he a bit different I think sadly macam
gila ah sia
what his roles oh macam melodic parts some lead parts
hari tu dorang jam bising sial
I don't know macam
drum dia pun annoying ah pasal pasal you know it's not our pedal I mean I mean you you know it's double pedal
but rubik's still play that kind of punk rock eh cause I heard from next door macam
tak but kena modern sikit dia kena macam bad religion baru baru bad religion or tapi got rise against influence propagandhi it's all it's all like relevant bands you know it's not the most macam band yang tak relevant is NOFX menyampah sia
if but to me kaybo is quite new ah since like but it's good lah cool but it's a point of time macam kau baru start kan studio kan along the way mesti kau discover something best best kan tapi nanti abeh nanti some ongoing project kau macam eh sial lah kenapa apa buat itu kan
oh kau oh ya difficult to follow the guitar and all lah then the music ah rabak sia
I don't know macam susah sia macam eh sial lah aku aku nak record lagu ni tapi tu aku nak tunggu barang tu sampai kalau tak nanti aku takut nanti aku aku kena pakai barang tu

oh ya ya ranggi I saw macam T-shirt what sticker whatever
oh okay okay oh pakai cermin mata ya ya ya
dia sound province dulu
same like azil eh though azil everytime come here he practise he want to borrow my mic uh my that one my mic what my effects the vocal effects I say eh dok eh dok kau jangan tanya lah kau nak pakai kau pakai letak balik jer lah malas lah kau asyik asyik tanya
ah lah but we all friends sia we don't need I mean we don't mengira sia
but if me I also don't care if pecah too bad ah cause I don't want that say can what it's not
if a stranger pecah kan I'll be angry ah if fail pecah kan
I don't know he's not that err bad feeling ah just like alamak dah nak buat apa
entah tu pasal lah
ya tapi dia macam tak dia lain sikit ah bro
entah same siol
lepak sia actually tak tengok band whatever
tu ah
actually next week he can lepak this weekend but this weekend I go sungei buloh sia sungei buloh is when ah I go saturday eh eh saturday
I go sungei buloh on saturday siao ajak him go sungei buloh
apa sial duduk rumah
pikiran sia like that time
I think after aku belah then start rabak gila ah
ya I heard macam korang banyak stop kan
tapi kau gila babi sia kau punya willpower
tak boleh susah
oh gila babi ah why is that eight o'clock ah
kau relax relax tapi banyak orang dah start jalan-jalan kan
oh macam over avert over exert
pengsan ah
ah dia nak jalan pergi mana pula aduh
eh gila
oh ya dia cakap dia kesian dia nampak kau hantar sekali ah siol
they start in punggol punggol waterfront mall tu you walk
ya then campur east coast
tak lah less ah ya
oh ya I heard park connector kan lebih kurang
okay uh ya dia bukan friday sebab friday shafie dia kena
pergi sekolah so dia kata
uh kalau dia dah penat
dia tak enjoy so he wants
dia tak ada eh ada
tapi shafie nak involve
ya lah memang si june
tak payah mark sebab dia tak ada
oh over there got itu apa Marybrown
affaf punya bukan dua lagi tu
si affaf boleh lah because her
uh the other two they don't need to go pun
knowing si apa knowing si
dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak ogi
kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh if we go out I keep saying to the kids
it's just nice eight eight person the children saja
I mean if you don't want to leceh then just do it at home lah kat rumah kak ogi
one you contact kak ogi
then what what she say lah then after that baru
cause I think for us kita yang tak jumpa aisyah dengan
si kecil tu at least kak ogi jumpa juga lah once and then ayah tu jumpa kan
bila raya lah
think raya haji tak salah
eh buat juga lah
macam okay so it depends
uh because sekarang ni yang paling ramai is either mahir or amin
kan kat rumah yang paling ramai so we either go to mahir's house or amin's house
kalau si lina dia happy kat rumah amin ah because it's more apa orang tu tak ada kucing
tak so ertinya we cannot come one time pun it's just macam contoh lah eh
so kita bawa mak dengan si matin
pergi rumah amin so kita lapan orang lah kita jumpa amin dengan budak-budak tu kan
ah then second group could be andir dengan si mahir
bawa the children ah
ah eh eh tapi andir dengan si mahir dah tak boleh eh
tak boleh eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why kalau nak jumpa kena macam
so contoh contoh eh
then uh maybe mahir send his kids but dah berapa
seven plus uh si kecil tu akil akif
anak amin kat rumah dia so already join in lah
ah adoi ya lah but if nak have a cousin gathering then can
get together before ini I think maybe okay lah tapi kalau let say it is um
so uh apa all the cousins meet one time
then okay balik
tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu okay kalau macam gitu
anak-anak saudara jer
so they can't sit together pun I mean they won't sit together pun
correct kalau dekat rumah amin ada lah dia orang bermain
so to me biar anak-anak saudara ni semua all the children can come down at one time
mm asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit
kita biar budak-budak semua pergi amin you handle the kids
kita uh adults alright bye bye kita go for our
so and then andir selalu kan tu
so it's not like ini lah it's the together ramai-ramai yang tak ada
so one of my suggestion is that lah uh let the kids all kumpul kat rumah si amin so at least the kids
once you step out the house tak boleh
okay other than that then they all meet at tu their ayah teh house
ayah teh will be very happy all come come come
abang is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
how and what else can we do with mama
then we ajak mak
that weekend ah the christmas weekend twenty six ke twenty seven
so if let's say you want to pergi pun boleh pakai wheelchair kat situ
jewel kan dia ada all those uh tours right
ada waterfall lah
the the apa the atas tu ada the the apa
tak ada lah dia ada cakap apa semalam wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
dia ada dia punya own timing
not today is tomorrow kakak dia ajak tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want memang he already say he uh a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
ya that's why that's why I say so lepas ni she have to go to apa ni
because I cakap dengan dia
that lecturer yang quite good lah she talk to him quite a bit
if you he teach at these two uni dua-dua uni dia ajar
murdoch ah dengan northumbria so dia ajar
so dia kata memang kat northumbria
whereas dekat murdoch
you dah buat all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
err coursework lah another apa testing test
no she already memang in this line
dia dah memang buat communication so she can
officers came into the class and dah explain pun everything tapi uh
even that wira guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go lah
uh adult already cuma I don't know in terms of
and then now they tell us dah tak ada uh two time
all ah all of the ni ya
ya lah so for example the other time dia pergi M
tu actually not bad and I saw the programme pun macam bagus tau dia ada sound recording space
mana kawan dia atau overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up lah and say okay go maybe australia ke mana
practise apa maksudnya
that's why okay another option is tengok dekat malaysia
because malaysia pun banyak twinning programme
and twinning programme dia pun not bad quite good
anak ustaz ah
ah so actually we just limit it to singapore cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil kaplan
so with that diploma kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain
one more year tapi it's just one more year ya lah
tapi ya lah dia at the end of the day apa
budak ni nak buat shafie mati-mati nak buat photography right he wants to be a photographer
shafie dia once he is focused on
so that part is good lah he kalau betul-betul interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
bukan yang dia she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like huh apa kejadah ni so she apply K
uh anak tiga ke apa tak tahu she is she used to teach in preschool
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can macam
ya lah I mean that is not the whole idea pun the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so kalau let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources pun
you you go and pause ke apa
no lah tak you tekan the other side oh my god oh my god okay
oh he he message he say kak I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
but if if if cannot get the numbers itu yang ini kan
session tu yang I told ira ira kalau let's say parents datang they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session ah I cakap
because you can still do the assessment on the first day dia datang tu you can do
tapi kalau let's say dia
so dia accept dia P three still have to give the
if ya so on the first day dia datang
dia buat the assessment dulu that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so ira angguk-angguk don't whether she faham ke she agree ke will do ke tak tahu
I cakap dengan dia print the progress report do the apa
so that tomorrow we print out semua all one time lah so that's why I want to know what is it
I don't know eh to me macam it's okay lah you just print out pun okay black and white apa
don't have to turun you have to pass to the children
uh final apa the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi on in june
uh Kumon pun cakap the same thing
so he the new centre yang dia nak run uh a franchise tu
okay so he has been teaching when he was in um school dulu dia mengajar
uh part time part time lah macam uh he take up one or two uh students that kind of thing
ah banking dia banking so he was already working in
so kena lay-off
okay dia dia
but he has always been doing tuition macam his part time lah and all
orang serani so he he used that word you know he say saya orang serani he say like that I was like ah
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can macam
entah eh no nama dia chen kang eh
tu lah I have to ask the children how to sebut nama dia so is ya
see the it uh the indian lady pun okay
then kita ada two more options lah ya
and then we can also work on apa kata orang tu
nisa kan dia cakap dia cuma nak ambil kalau suami dia punya cuti falls on ni
we're talking about the cake jadi asal dengan cake tadi
ya I saw the picture then after that you terus tukar daripada gambar jadi message from gambar then it become a message that is where saya macam
so that that was the part when I actually eh ah you ask you ask me cake because you didn't mention macaron lagi so it was just cake
but I I didn't know the the macaron was choose a'ah sebab tu saya tanya
but she didn't say what oh it's a mix eh macaron dia mix colour jer ah
is it oh you can choose different like I I I I don't eat macarons always so saya a bit lost
tapi flavour no no no awak macam banyak-banyak flavour does it incur cost ataupun sama jer harga
oh okay I thought macam
oh it's not like semua satu satu satu macam err what you call it alternate macam selang-seli ah tak eh okay okay
mana dapat contact
orh abeh dia punya review is good
so the cake tak sedap ah
abeh the thing is kita tak boleh try dulu ke abeh macam gini a bit
oh by right kita boleh datang and taste correct so kalau kalau kita order sikit dia tak they don't sell macam kek tu a small portion that we can buy and taste
inshaa allah lah takde apa-apa lah can lah
so that is cake that is done dah habis
huh I don't apa yang two hour frame err saya tak faham
two hour time frame I think in advanced for them to get there I think oh okay I think I saya rasa they need to get there dorang nak kena stack up nak kena susun they need two hours for it to get ready so that means dalam macam they need to be there by six or something like that by seven they need to do the susun ah that's why they need two hours just in case tak it's a buffer time
okay ah I I could be right betul saya rasa ada chance betul
but because usually cake tak akan datang terus dah diri gitu they need to susun letak and then they macam ah tu lah a'ah ah mmhmm
cause I saw the message your mum macam nanti letak something decoration or something like that apa tu dia nak apa
dia nak apa your mum nak suruh macam jangan plain gitu ah so ada ada decoration
biar lah by the way tadi nabil call call you first eh dia call you first is it
oh okay K K K K so I think I think dia macam terperanjat ah I think oh I haven't answer their question so dia call saya saya dia cakap actually I talked to hakimmah oh then I macam eh asal dia call saya tak sempat ya tak kari instant tu kira baru letak baru letak dia message saya tak sempat nak message dia dah dah reply awak pun dah keep asking questions terus saya macam eh okay wait
tak awak terus tak awak terus ah terus you mmhmm ah correct ah correct mmhmm so dia terus err awak terus reply balik tak sempat saya nak baru nak type kira uh okay I was about to type sekali awak terus dah uh I didn't I don't know the answer it's like oh okay I was I was about to tell you yang he mention uh okay this is what he said to me lah dia cakap
I don't know I tak sempat
then you told your mum to delete atau dia just dia paiseh tak I think what nabil is trying to accommodate dia dia cakap yang macam orang tak makan macam those who are working for the wedding they will try to put as crew uh huh that's what he said lah that's why kalau apa-apa
so anyway yang tadi dia cakap err dia kata kalau I think I think the ambassador tanya ke apa he say just tell them they are part of the crew jer he will also say lah they part of the crew that's what he told me mm so kira it's like macam we have to be on the same page ah dia cakap gitu jer
oh ah okay I thought she gonna ask question I I I was wondering apasal I didn't save your mum's number tadi saya tengah macam terfikir ni siapa I it's either I it's a the the the boss atau your mum so I was looking at it okay you added it then that number belongs to your mum I should save it
so cepat that was very fast I think she she posted lama eh maybe I was saya yang lambat lah
oh ya homework besok besok besok besok besok I besok saya ada site then sekejap jer pukul tiga ah then after that dah boleh insha allah pasal besok I
ya we can do like this also on friday ke
to dia punya problem friday friday should be okay I think
tu ah
pasal belum confirm pe pasal kalau awak dah pilih that means saya pilih jer I think you go with your mum first
mm once dah confirm
oh jadi nanti next time kalau tidak bila saya datang pun dia nak kena okay tak dia tapi dia ada intention to go any other places tak lepas tu
tak ah kita
tak payah lah kita keep to the minimum kalau saya ikut begum jer settle
ah let your mum choose lah takpe
tadi dia datang ah dia datang petang pe lambat terus a'ah dia daripada site so dia datang dia datang terus dia cakap eh uh hakimmah hakimmah minta aku favour tolong terus saya I just senyum jer ah tanya tolong apa jadi emcee eh a'ah seh aku the last time jadi emcee was poly time seh dia cakap gitu ah that's what he said
I just say like macam takde lah apa yang susah sangat engkau cuma cakap okay sekarang sudah mah that's why saya cakap senang jer kau announce macam sekarang sudah masuk waktu azan dah lepas tu kau cakap okay sekarang kita nak akad nikah ah boleh ramai-ramai duduk gitu jer bukan kau suruh suruh berbual-bual interact takde I told him no you don't have to do that you just need to talk bila benda dia nak jadi kau bilang just inform jadi orang macam uh takpe takpe takpe takpe aku nak berbual pasal hakimmah ngan kau I macam merepek you know lah him you know lah him he always likes to macam kacau-kacau takpe takpe aku ada aku
a'ah dia abeh dia kata aku make sure hafiz S pun kena get involved I don't know biar biar jangan lepas tu then he said jangan jangan dia menggigil sudah
tapi I think yang yang yang pasal sound system I don't know they allow us to touch or not sometimes ada orang tak pasal dia dia ya sometimes they they don't allow you to touch you know
usually they don't allow to touch ah tapi kalau kita tahu
I think provided kalau takde event before that that means we can come early tau macam pasal slot before us is kosong uh
so okay lah maybe macam cake semua boleh set up siang kalau kalau let's say uh grab time
syafiq dengan rahmat um kalau ada kereta boleh lah dorang tengokkan kalau tak siapa lagi seh tengok rahmat is a actually syafiq dengan rahmat boleh lah syafiq boleh ambil awak atau rahmat can just stay there
ya but the plan is sekarang kakak cakap amirul will take care dengan bapa semua jadi itu part so kita kita focus on our side jer
that's why I think I set up saya pakai kat situ juga so that means
tu lah okay
boleh lah as in kita I don't know how is the rule I don't know macam mana kan semua
ya lah correct that means baru saya datang from home kat situ pula ya ya ya a'ah
so that means I tak macam gini tau you can pakai baju kat situ tau eh actually dah boleh pakai baju makeup yang pakai kat sana
makeup oh kira dah kat sana juga eh like that
kalau kalau tidak I I don't know for my side ada pak andam ke tidak ah ataupun pakai macam mana pakaian so kalau tidak
it's that atau I get is isn't it groom
from what I know eh kadang tak ada pak andam uh usually they will show mungkin kalau kalau groom tu nanti they will show the groom atau someone who's gonna be close to me how to wear it kalau dia boleh catch up boleh pick up then tak payah so after that dia pakaikan kalau tidak then that means nak kena get kakak punya kawan tu ah yang siapa I don't know georgie ke sofian I think that that's the name something like that that guy boleh buat dia memang a'ah
eh uh kalau rizal ada
eh uh kalau rizal ada okay ah tak the thing is dia nak kena ada orang yang tahu kalau ada orang tahu senang kalau takde nanti eh macam mana nak pakai ah pasal dia nak kena ikat
tak tahu I think tak lah actually the best tapi the best is belajar dulu
tak the thing is you need to teach who kalau teach sendiri saya boleh buat sendiri it's simple as that tapi dia nak kena pin kan ikat kan
that's why just just need to learn jer everything on YouTube most sekarang correct
oh malay dance ajar ikat kain eh
okay anyway tadi kita tulis
tak actually dia simple jer dia ikatkan sekejap jer dia ikatkan tu jer tak payah pegang apa-apa dia ikat tu dah then I can go off already I don't know nak kena pakai makeup I don't need to wear makeup pe kan
ada orang macam eh touch up touch up okay wait sabar are you going to put inai
lelaki tak payah lah tak perlu kalau tak nak boleh
what do you think saya kalau boleh tak payah lah inai tapi ah ya I I I just don't want to nanti

standard lah qasidah-qasidah relax relax I think before that saya saya actually tengah tunggu nak maghrib tu saya saya nak tunggu maghrib tu saya nak suruh ustaz hakeem err kalau ustaz hakeem datang ah I just want him to recite a few qasidah tengah tunggu recite qasidah tapi takut dia paiseh dia sorang mm mm
a'ah sebelum nikah so sambil sambil tunggu tu qasidah sikit baca doa tapi boleh ah I think can do doa selamat while waiting pasal nanti bukan doa selamat ah baca zikir ustaz hakeem memang sorang pun dia power tapi kalau ustaz hakeem pegang mic tak kesah dulu dia okay tapi selalunya ustaz hakeem kalau pegang mic ah wahab dah start godeh board that's what I know kalau ustaz hakeem masuk jer dia godeh board
mm tak usually kalau kalau wahab dah godeh board correct correct usually wahab kalau godeh board dia will do as in general jer enough kalau uh ustaz hakeem dia adakan echo lah but it takes a while pe to get it kita tengok macam mana lah tapi
usually I think ustaz boleh baca qasidah sikit ke atau berzikir I think actually okay usually he likes to do that lah it would be nice jadi tak nervous sangat aku terima nikahnya aku terima nikah
firdaus hari-hari seh sekarang jumpa aku jumpa like he keep saying aku terima aku terima dia keep saying dia dia pasal dia nya dah nak dekat
tak dia tak stressful dia kata just sekarang ingat jer ah macam main-main main-main ah just main-main the with the thing jadi bila on the day dah macam kat lidah pe just hujung hujung aku terima nikah nama nama nama dengannya okay pasal that's how you practise you just keep saying it as in as in it's normal lama lama terus okay like that

I think that one that one from my that one my side your one sirih dara kakak I think kakak ada contact ah I think can ask the guy
oh okay then keep to your mum contact dah
gubahannya tray

okay wait pasal kelmarin kakak cakap yang kawan dia tu georgie semua amirul dah contact pasal dia yang pinjamkan dia yang ada dulang tu so kalau kita ada barang tu semua kita kasi pada dia kan dia siapkan then on the day kita tinggal ambil jer semua dah siap
okay okay kalau kalau kalau betul your mum nak beli do your own ada time tak kalau kalau
tak pasal kelmarin kakak already told me yang dia tu pernah buat I saw yang dulang kakak punya ah dorang they
is it I don't know kita tak I don't know
kita belum discuss pe pasal dulang
ya takpe lah tu that one can discuss later lah for this one
jap eh
oh ya know not yang firdaus punya venue he said he told me eh aku venue yes dia buat tiga ratus
pasal ah tapi dia cakap fifty by fifty that's why I said saya cakap kita punya tak boleh dia kata pasal shah ibrahim was daring enough to
ya lah fifty at one time so that means somehow pasal I think most of the venue don't want to take the risk fifty fifty fifty pun still the same people pe keep coming kan so I think most venue don't want they just do fifty jer so I think shah ibrahim somehow
but but because that time tak silap saya dia cakap adik eh mak dia pergi maknya firdaus ni went for the wedding one of the cousin wedding it already happening lah shah ibrahim allow macam said ah uh the mum saw dia punya invite is I think about a few hundred so ada orang ambassador eh no I think orang or ambassador is down there to uh overlook kat depan ah he standing in front ah ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct I think that's I think that's how he managed to convince them ah as in okay you can see at how we provide lah I think that's the procedure macam gitu
dia datang mmhmm mmhmm tapi memang
itu I told him I saya tanya firdaus dah habis kau pak saudara-mara kau pun yang jaga tak [ah] I think he will
dia pakai mesin tu pe remember that thing
abeh kita nak kena kita nak kena submit name eh
for us to make ah because we know oh no pasal kita tahu pe who are our guests dah itu jer
fifty people okay lah considered as our guest list ah but for us also our part is to just record lah nama kalau apa-apa jadi pun just pump kasi nama jer correct who are coming we just record itu ah itu jer correct
no of course not siapa nak subscribe
that's why then asal tak pakai awak punya
I know I remember but just I was I was doing I was writing down something dah
tripod small tripod stand small tau very small kecil punya kecil betul-betul kecil for the cam ah kan ada dia ada yang
use the same wi-fi to sync I don't know need to try I I I need to google I need to do a bit of research I don't know need to check cause from what I saw yesterday was using but then probably boleh pakai on by wi-fi kalau by wi-fi that means boleh gerak orang just hold dekat jer anyway it's really small kecil gila so it's easy ah to hold it kalau tidak orang pakai chest pack ah
tak pasal you have to face it have to face that's why dia punya screen face us macam very awkward awkward lah you have to see yourself I don't want
that now but like abeh laptop dia the thing is the laptop is big you have to keep shifting around orang leceh seh nak pegang kalau benda tu kecil dia boleh pegang pakai tangan and then just turn left right turn left right jer which is more better rather than you shift the whole screen every time just to adjust angle
work from home and then besok I got one site pukul tiga
tak ah sekejap jer pergi site
saya saya pergi site survey that's it takde pergi office
ya lah about one hour nya tempat pasal ni bukan really pasal dia macam just resurvey kita dah ada barang tu just need to shift it somewhere a proper location like in another location ah mm mmhmm
ya ya should be sempat lah it cannot be that long
sama macam fajr juga I think it's just a stage where
tak pasal tangan mak kakak I think tangan terus pump jadi tahu I think you can never spare the kid
mm tapi bukan
I think bukan pukul sampai sakit pukul just to ah
ah even even even macam just just to macam sepak pakai tangan pun macam just like that just dia tahu dia eh kena jadi dia tahu eh sakit okay so stop a'ah lah mm bukan sampai lah dera banting takde lah not like that
anyway tadi yang the video I send to you was too long
oh that's why you said it was too long but but actually it's quite good lah it it gives macam ustaz tu used to I went I used to went for his classes last time
ustaz madarrus he used to be in singapore now he's I think at mmhmm mm so I went for his classes last time ada cerita juga lah cerita dia so anyway he's quite good honestly kalau tanya saya baik so the the sister ask you saw the question right the sister ask about men
not being good leaders that kind of thing ah and then he he agree to it lah and then he explained why maybe the reason why things happen men nowadays boys nowadays doesn't turn out to be macam have a leadership have leadership ah responsibility like old people dorang kan ada responsibility it's just that nowadays we are okay ah simply put I also understand ah dia cakap macam nowadays err parents okay macam dia cakap parents usually perempuan takpe tak boleh balik lambat perempuan very strict semua tak boleh ya dia macam partly part
exactly pasal dorang apply to girls that's why tu dia cakap and then
mm then yang itu that's the problem pasal I think believe dulu orang kampung macam macam mana pun nanti kalau orang-orang lama pun ah nanti macam mana pun they will still start teaching the boys to tak responsibility kau nak kena jaga adik kau macam gitu
macam wah bagus pe kau bagus macam the the the biasness eh biasness
tak tahu ah I think sekarang happening to us is the modern and then we are too exposed dengan
ya lah western it's come from western that's why dulu orang kampung dia cakap budak-budak lelaki they they they become matured faster pasal the dad I I think the further the behind part they explain a lot of things ah macam it the mother also play a role dia kata macam not to strike not strike fear tau macam to gain respect for macam the mother hold the status of the father macam make the status among the the children they fear the father fear the father macam respect tau yes pasal dia cakap macam
mm abeh yes dia kata macam dulu orang cakap bapa balik jer tak payah bapa cakap balik nampak bapa balik takde tunggu straightaway masuk rumah punya bapa tak payah tenung pun dia step tak nampak jer automatically come home you know pasal automatically the father have this respect already abeh macam the mum dia kata hold this status macam okay ni bapa kau punya cawan kau jangan pegang macam ini pinggan bapa kau punya kau jangan makan dari bapa kau punya pinggan macam the mother so dia macam keep dia gitu tau so dia kata the father is the leader of the family and the mother is the leader of the household and children macam gitu so but overall it's still the father ah so dia kata nowadays even the father lack that macam I don't know what happened lah but then dia kata the fathers just lack lack
abeh dia kata yes ah tu ah he was talking about that also that was that one thing also
then then he said then he also mentioned mentioned this thing ah men have ego and men always wanted to be needed faham kan wants to be needed
yes that's the thing perempuan asyik I want I'm independent dia kata tak boleh the the rule of a man is to be needed kalau kau take away that he's not needed dia a very yes that's one thing ataupun dia punya ego mati nanti dia terus macam abeh dia kata that's why a lot people fall into depression pasal guy not needed women are independent dia cakap gitu that that's the tapi it's a this is the theory ah
dia kata ya
dia kata tak the thing is macam dia dia kata ada there was this one person who came up to me ustaz I'm married I have children and then I I don't have a problem but the main problem is my husband dia cakap gitu so actually I can earn my own money but I don't need him but I don't know why I'm married lepas tu ustaz tak boleh cakap apa-apa I don't know why I'm married macam I think it's just pasal no the thing is she is a woman tak bukan tak sayang I think over time dia ada children dia busy kerja they live too long together you get tired of the guy get tired of the guy something like that
okay wait kalau you have a kids that means you separate from your kids ah just the two of
the bond ah the bond together ah macam have adventures ah
develop again ah oh ya rekindle ah kira ada semangat membara balik
tak okay eh I think it's easy to say the thing is it's easy to say tau but then kalau awak tengok eh the context of singapore in the context of singapore susah you see eh sekarang jer to survive some you you look at the household lelaki bini nak kena
activity lah a'ah ya correct tak payah spend money ya just to macam cycling I can yes yes mmhmm mm
tetapi kan mm tapi still and then macam this kind of thing is one of the thing tapi macam dalam every day tu macam kalau boleh macam dapat solat jemaah macam malam together that would be ya that that how the ya that that's how you ah mmhmm that's like how to
ya lah nowadays ya lah tapi mak cakap
ya boleh boleh tak salah a'ah boleh memang boleh macam saya solat jemaah kat masjid mm
mm can ah ya boleh kan dah cakap macam suami nak gi dia suka sembahyang jemaah kat masjid so just go solat masjid jemaah balik dia imamkan isteri lagi ah boleh no nothing wrong with that pasal isteri have to do her chores abeh dia nak solat jemaah pe kesian kan solat lah bagus think this kind of thing can can can keep ourselves
a'ah lah tapi
tapi macam macam firuz mm macam firuz he likes to solat macam firuz is see so far lah firuz and amira like to solat jemaah so I think they don't want to solat sendiri-sendiri so which is good also lah
kadang-kadang firuz bawa solat tapi firuz punya al-fatihah good seh saya kadang-kadang macam eh you haven't pray ah you pray on your own first lepas tu saya dengarkan lah I correct him then it's okay
okay lah tadi a'ah satu hari

depends ah depends ya but is most of the time nanti kadang-kadang you know like like err news then there's err music updates abeh ah yang those bands yang aku like minat ah aku look up to their facebook then aku will try to see what's what's going on ah in their lives
updated ah but but but for me to macam okay for
aku nak post err benda-benda aku sendiri aku post like something macam bodoh ah like it's something funny never never serious tak pernah rasa macam leceh ah

oh ya ya the comments speaking of which actually we're supposed to talk about music right oh this is about music right okay okay sorry sorry sorry kugiran music(ppo
ya but anyways ya that that facebook thing that we are talking about sekarang ni kan macam I also agree ah like most of the time kan nanti aku tengok um the comments eh nanti aku kekek sendiri ah
very sungguh punya truthful

oh it's a kira macam french punya kind of err usually okay usually luke is L U K E kan
right ah so this is french kira french punya version of
luq apa ah
just err ya let's go back to like currently let's go back to the ya the which is music ah so kira like nowadays kau dengar what kind of um music ah
and then and then they will macam err terbawa-bawa abeh that's it
ah abeh then the next day they are your enemy ya
yes because okay err before okay before kita continue dengan kau punya music err current music err you err current music are you listening to
we used to grow up with macam err punk rock right punk rock then the ska then there's reggae and what what not right
era tu kira that time ah kan that era so but um
what got err kira-kira while how did you get into err this like current music that you are listening to
ya because I like to ask questions kan ah macam tak ah but because err like that time err like I really enjoyed macam
the fact that you were on drums because you knew what you were doing that's the most important part about being a drummer you just have to know what you're doing yang penting
kau terror
yang penting kau terror eh
dan sekarang kau main guitar
huh iya ke
yang penting kita terror bro
guitars ya macam okay because susah datang ah like it's usually okay when the macam drummers they will stick to macam drums all the way like throughout their lives drum drum drum drum drum then um
but you it's like a different case you before err after you like um kind of macam give up playing drums you actually went into right
oh gitu ya I actually tried you know macam
um or like techno or err what what what genre do you mention earlier on tadi
ah okay okay despite I want to understand macam further err okay disc jockey when you say you mix one song to another song kan so which means you have two turntables correct
so what you are trying to achieve is kira macam kau nak make
err like err a track from scratch betul tak
okay so okay in in in bands punya kind of a point of view band eh it's like you want to have your own band instead of play you're having a band with err kira main cover ah gitu
betul tak ah
which is a bit ya leceh ah kan macam might as well we play err kita punya own originals so that is what you want to achieve in
ni lounge eh
eh kira macam during that time bila bila kau do all that kan macam
best tak
oh that explains kira guitar tu is mostly um bila kau dah like into dirty blues and stuff like that lah
so um macam tadi aku cakap kan
aku tengah sakit perut so I was like oh my god tak boleh tahan okay that was an awkward topic okay maybe let's talk about um okay what do you want to talk about

I mean at the end of day I mean ah how how much netflix can you watch right within a day I mean aku tengok netflix one one hour drama pun dah aku dah macam lethargic gila like alone like to be staying I mean right now I'm staying home lah because because of this the whole entire err situation
I mean K mine was quite interesting I mean err as you know aku kan buat caregiving job kan to my friend so err I mean yesterday I was just resting I mean the day before so of course err
um when it comes to have to my friend need um what I do normally is I go over to his place um I will like um prep him lah and keep him proper and like aku mandikan dia
uh and then dia nak berak and everything so aku dia and everything then aku nak kena siapkan dia so everything took like one hour plus and then after that
err we were waiting for transport because kawan dia nak kena hantar tau hantar dia so we were like one hour late for the appointment so we're supposed to be there by three
but we only managed to get the transport by like three forty five lah almost four lah so lambat lambat lambat gila so by the time we reached err the hospital
err hospital tu somewhere around dekat err in the east
so it was almost four so by the time kita masuk then the the therapists were saying like err one hour lambat and everything lah last standard procedure lah huh but they would just do their best lah because of this COVID nineteen kan
so okay lah I mean it it then after that aku hantar dia balik and then lepas tu bila aku hantar dia balik after that there was guest that came in so the guest happens to be err like err dia punya adik punya wife punya parents
so of course aku nak kena siapkan lah I had to like wipe him err tukar baju dia tukar t-shirt dia and everything so I had to like prep him and then he was dia pun nak makan
dia dah makan err then the the parents of err dia punya err apa tu adik dia punya wife masuk tau into the room
and then it was like so awkward ke tu orang tua aku tak tahu kenapa dengan orang tua but bila dia like when they entered the room aku dah tahu okay this is going to be a very sombre sedih atmosphere
it's kind of betul gang ah they were talking to my friend and then they started to cry aku dah macam ya alah aku cakap no don't cry and then after that the one thing that made me even macam tersentuh sikit lah bila bunyi apa tu
your phone ah kacau jer your phone oh your alarm okay tak apa tak apa so apa tu semantic noise so ah so okay back to my story so lepas tu ah then the the mother lah the mother said to me lah ah nama anak nasri ya
then like mm a'ah cik nama saya nasri dah okay I was feeding my friend right so after that the mum was like nak nak tahu kan anak suap anak suap err err kawan ni anak dapat pahala aku dah macam aku tak tahu apa nak buat do not know how to continue the convo
ya ya ya ya ya and then aku dah macam
ya ya it's true it's true and then aku macam and then err lepas tu err then the mother was like saying err um saya jaga err suami saya dia masuk hospital enam kali then I'm like eh kamu bual err personal story pula kat aku aku dah macam macam mana nak react ah so aku macam then I I try my best
a'ah I tried my best to stay composed lah then after that err aku pun dah macam alamak aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah start nangis then they started to cry aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam no no no no this this cannot dia they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am macam tak boleh I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up macam tersentuh ah and then automatically my air mata will mengalir you know so I was like then I was like quickly err err apa tu kasih suap then after that I just say uh
cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap lah so I went out of the room lah then when I went out the room
and then kau tahu apa you know my mum's friend um
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya kiranya my my friend punya mum
mother lah kirakan ah tak boleh masuk you know inside the room because you see ah
because yang sakit tu anak dia tau so bila so she is and then she's also sakit so when she will feel sedih you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition dia akan nangis
ah yes yes yes that like she feel like macam anak dia akan pergi dulu you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then aku dekat dapur and then the mum would would like tell me lah like like you know err the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say err
tu lah err takde orang lah yang dia kesian you know aku punya kawan macam dia kan sekarang pun yang jaga dia it's like the father and the maid apa the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend lah so macam so sometimes bila dia tak mampu to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first apa because the mother is the priority first apa
so you know at times kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa err dia pun sometimes will say you know like err
puas hati masukkan err dalam ni lah rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already ah and then the mother the mother say lah macam
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like macam golongan really yang orang tua lah
so sometimes bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak react with aku dah macam huh macam mana nak what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like macam err takpe lah cik sabar lah cik cik tahan jer lah
but even the the mum also say lah macam the mum somehow I can feel like the mum macam somehow appreciate aku lah macam akan cakap apa like what you tell me like err
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum macam
the mum really appreciate aku ah the mum macam sometimes I think the mum dia tersentuh lah and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon ah tak silap
because they dia dia orang orang boyan I think boyan ke jawa I think err jawa jawa sorry dia orang orang jawa
the parents are orang jawa so so so nasi rawon is like a big thing lah so I didn't come on the day she masak cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend lah like macam eh aku tak dapat datang ah tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat
so the then the mum said ah tu lah cik masak ah hari tu tapi tu lah err anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang I'm like sorry lah cik K I mean
honestly aku cakap dengan kau
aku kan nak balik kan in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
uh dia automatically dia akan sedih so aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak react then he he say to me lah like hey can you do macam online from here then I'm like huh how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia
I mean after so many years of just macam you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now macam you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time macam kita have that conversation with beberly kan
ah yang kat mcdonald's err like I was very very lost when I was like what umur aku twenty two all the way to twenty seven can you imagine I was lost for almost five years
so so that's why I was like telling myself err when when comes to to my friend lah ya aku tak boleh tolong dia all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to ulang balik come back because of the whole swab test err quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day dia dia pun nak kena redha and I aku pun cakap dengan dia lah macam
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just macam
he always dia dia selalu ingat yang
yang aku jer seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia
then aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia lah macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya cousin setakat cousin aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa
tapi dia dia macam tak lah macam macam err then dia cakap lah yang cousin aku tak take initiative and everything
mum betul betul betul
memang membastard rabak punya
ya I mean I don't know lah err I mean err if I if I want to share you personally then kau macam
err he even ni tau that he gave a certain amount of money to me tau
and the amount is one K with dia kasih aku dia jadi macam sedekah kat aku dia cakap eh err you take lah this money to pay for your semester fees as alhamdulillah but at the end of the day at the same time aku rasa macam
kau tahu macam you are tied down to something that's why aku kalau boleh tak nak macam
I don't want to accept the money lah you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because um dia dah ada ni ah you know sometimes orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat kan
so aku just accept graciously lah and aku and I I I feels that money to pay for my err semester fees err for my err semester lepas
ah ya it feels like an amanah you know so by the but aku pun rasa macam serba salah lah macam need doing kaus eh macam
then dia cakap tak apa tak apa just ambil aku macam alamak macam mana tu but but you see like see aku dah macam you see ah like my my my err university journey like a hamburger lah alhamdulillah I would say that macam err my urusan has been dipermudahkan lah
uh with regards to my semester fees I mean err I have contribution from my late my my late step grandfather my late uncle and then then dia juga ah apa tu contribute to my semester fees
ah rezeki so macam like I say lah like you are tied down to something lah so aku kalau boleh macam
ya and I like somewhat in debt but at the same time aku macam
macam this is my my share lah macam aku kalau boleh tak nak mungkir tau macam because
aku rasa unless you are dedicated to the person and then macam you if you are not dedicated to the person you would not help the person all the way to the extent lah I mean as I do not know of any other person who does the same thing as me I think I'm the only one lah as of now lah

ah faham faham faham

mm faham faham
err dia tak go through apa you and your uh and your other siblings went through the hardship you know nak cari makan and everything and how your mum raise you guys up and everything
eh kau nangis ke kat situ
you haven't kau takde intention nak go onto public sector ke
masuk like teaching I don't know maybe
but untuk I aku rasa macam
err the ones yang err macam study hard apostrophe
will progress kuat juga then the ones yang err tak progress are the ones yang macam mediocre
will just fought out in society aku masih ingat err I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher err he
ah now when I think about him ah when I think about that statement ah about what he made at last time ah aku macam eh you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad ah you you are that ah that
macam his statement ah macam ada sense of macam elitism you know macam macam macam how our err government ah macam gitu that kind of it's like the vibe right there the dia kasih ya
macam very similar to how the government macam how the government is like lah so aku fikir eh you mean apa yang people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are err apa tu content with what they have so
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so um so before I went there in my head I always thought macam able to kan aku nak belajar kat sana then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive lah in the beginning lah or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore kan pakai cambridge kan and sana they have their own system tau ah for apa tu macam for how to grade and grading and everything
and then kat sana aku perasan wah the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart eh we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know macam ones from sabah with the ones from johor
the ones from perak like aku dah aku I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but aku realize about them is what they lack is
they are they are very err examination based kau faham kan exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is macam hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is macam err the examination is err it's it's it's it's very straightforward ah macam uh you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like err those yang macam err critical thinker
is tak banyak tau kat sana
the ones yang critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones yang from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question yang macam critic yang macam higher thinking ah
but because our our education system is dah macam nurture us like this kan but bila when we go there dia orang think yang kita ni super on tau
so aku macam huh super on eh not really leh it's just that uh our just that our culture macam singapore culture has trained us to be like this macam and then some more you have to understand aku kat sana aku pay enam ribu eh
so every hour and every minute tu bagi aku is duit so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like macam when ah so sometimes they they the malaysian kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam
dia orang they are quite intimidated lah even my classmate also told me ah yang the very first time they met me they she feels that I am aku sombong aku arrogant aku cakap eh serious ah
she say ah engkau macam poyo ah aku dah serious ah poyo
ah poyo then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with aku I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my kepala would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior lah because you are overseas mah you're like you need to hustle apa and then then
alhamdulillah I would say that I am coping very well lah I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that aku drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second um
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself err then I was not really focused ah like I still remember like the day before the exam baru aku nak belajar can you imagine
ya yang answer script
ah it's like a macam err I based err meaning ah I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same ah like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me lah ah who has studied in
um ah in semester three I was very low key nak mampus tau aku macam aku every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet uh I even like um tak post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key ah
ya and then this coming semester four pun err aku hopefully lah I can get a err very good lah but all in all aku cakap dengan kau I mean
I don't know I don't know lah macam but but you see ah I I remember that time ah aku baru balik dari kedah tau nak balik err pergi tak silap ke singapore uh
then aku dah eh macam mana kau tahu then she say oh I know lah because of your accent and the way you talk
aku dah wow I'm shocked man
talk betul betul betul
eh err you she she's a teacher in a she is she is a graduate from singapore eh tak silap aku eh no no no err no she's a she's a alumni of
but her brother actually err studies in and err did err did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl err so to cut the story short dia cakap dengan aku lah eh uh you kan orang melayu kenapa you tak stay kat malaysia err I think you should
err take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking eh apa dia cakap tu maybe there is a certain truth you know because kat sana aku perasan orang melayu wah babe privilege babe
macam privileged gila aku cakap privileged you know
yes yes yes exact bumiputera thing
yes yes betul betul betul then aku cakap lah eh but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then err aku cakap dengan dia lah I was very frank with her I told her err you know how kat sini kita
err macam casing kita punya bangsa kan macam tindaskan
err or we are being like extra lah kirakan not extra lah we're just being err we are we we we're looked down
tapi kat sana it's err it's bangsa dia orang yang look down kau faham kan so dia macam terbalik err macam dia err aku cakap dengan very frank ah then dia cakap ya I faham I faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat is not
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city lah but the expenses there is mahal nak mampus
I find like macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang the shampoo body shower oh wah I tell you mahal sangat macam satu
one body shower macam dove eh twenty four ringgit eh siala twenty four ringgit when you pay when you pay fifty ringgit to pay for the twenty four ringgit and when you left with that balance eh macam kiwak macam eh this is very expensive leh but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot kan then it's like worth it kan padahal it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether
I always thought like macam is quite cheap aku I when I go over to like macam kedah I go penang wah it's even cheaper sia barang-barang dia then I'm like I'm quite shocked lah in one way or another
and then err I mean I always got teased off lah I always got teased yang eh err by my classmate eh kau tak nak kahwin ke dengan orang malaysia
aku macam ah kahwin orang malaysia kau tahu tak aku punya preference apa
no I'm serious I mean I I have I have this classmate she's orang johor you know so she dia macam dia macam merajuk you know dengan aku because aku macam friend zone dia
no no no that one is another girl that one is another class that one is another department err that one is err sastera that one is my my my own classmate lah and then macam macam mana aku tak friend zone dia babe dia
dia she's from okay dia not very the feminine kind of girl oh dia macam very kasar then dia suara very loud and then dia very macam err like you you can sense a presence you know and then she's very she participate in every college activities
and then aku kalau aku betul-betul nak menghala kepada
ke jalan yang lurus and then my choice of girl is somewhat very feminine you know macam honestly like ya ya ya I mean yang orang yang pakai tudung yang very very very manis to look at I don't know ah that is my kind of preference ah when it comes to
ah sia aku macam siala I mean
ah syak kurang ajar lah tak lah but I don't know I mean I don't know you never know what you never know err our future like who knows maybe kau one day get married or aku one day get married you'll never know
but but innocence that macam aku punya preference when comes to I have I have a type of of of of lady of or a girl and yang aku suka lah and my preference is macam yang putih yang dia no need no dia tak perlu putih sangat it's just putih dia pakai tudung ke very very typically uh
eh aku tak hitam kita sawo kita sawo matang kulit kita is sawo matang
sawo matang tanned tanned sawo matang
so err ya so and then kurang ajar tak lah hitam is hitam and then after that um then aku kat sana aku kan macam abang-abang aku kan macam abang-abang singapore kan
ah ya ya ya you know my suara is always like hello
and then lagi suara aku ah my my voice will bounce apa whenever I use the mic when it comes to presentation err in lecture hall
so macam I'm known as the suara abang-abang lah but then dia orang tak tahu lah they akan close all
no I'm serious ah no aku dah macam aku cakap dengan kau aku macam double lives ah kat sana you know like
in school I am like quite err the abang-abang but
ah eh babe do you know that aku that time menang err did I did I show you a picture that I aku menang err prince of the night you know for for an event
macam ah so I I won like a prom kingish punya competition
I know it sounds crazy aku pun tak sangka and I was the host emcee for the event and and the judge was my lecturer so what he he he actually chose me as the prom king err or the prince of the night aku dah huh apa ni
no because um he chose me because I was I was one of the I was ultimately I was the only one who dressed very well that night aku ah because I was wearing blazer
ah ya I was I was wearing blazer then I bought this like yellow punya macam like a macam like a apa tu belt ke apa dah apa-apa lah and then I yellow err
I think ada I pun nak tunjuk you guys ah then so I was quite shocked lah so
so like err like err like I tell you like I I feel like I'm living a double life macam kat kat sekolah aku macam very quiet quiet baik-baik but
but at the same time aku aku kan quite wild kan like you know the number of people aku met aku err make friends with babe by in instagram by in facebook I'm still making friends up to today
I mean it's called networking lah although kawan aku yang kat singapore ni tak err I have I aku tak pernah disclose anything about it to do you know even that time I post err something about me going to kedah in my instagram
wei babe dia sampai err dia he actually
then lepas tu member dah sedih eh so dia dalam keadaan sakit dia dia boleh lagi sedih and aku dah macam eh kan kau dalam keadaan sakit kau boleh fikir yang aku nak macam
babe kalau
so macam ah you don't have to tell the other like I don't have to tell my friend lah because it's my prerogative apa
ya this my acts also apa so but
so I was like telling myself oh no no tak boleh aku dah I I cannot post this kind of err this kind of post anymore because he will be triggered eh ni nama ni triggered dia triggered gila dia triggered lepas tu dia triggered lepas tu dia start questioning me lah macam kau pergi dengan siapa and everything lepas tu dia dah start
ya then dia macam sedih lah dia dah sedih and everything aku dah eh siala ni member nak sedih
engkau ah kalau you see eh if you are sakit kau tak payah fikir tau benda begini you don't even have to think about all these all you think is about your preparation to meet
siap aku cakap dengan kau ah aku pun sometimes pun macam bila dia nak macam err intimate dengan aku aku sometimes pun I tried to elak you know because
berdosa kan kau orang tu tengah sakit lepas tu engkau kau engkau macam add onto ke fill onto his desire dia memang ada desire tu kita tak menafikan everyone has desire desire
but kena control lah aku pun cakap dengan dia eh you control lah you tak boleh terlalu on sangat leh because you never know ah in any bila kau orang cakap dia tengah kita tengah buat or kita tengah intimate sekali err tuhan tarik nyawa dia ke gila
in that kind of state ke you know because it's he's in that kind of that state state and then he's like he's super sensitive I mean at the end of the day in every situation err kalau tuhan nak tarik nyawa kau people err god would just take away your nyawa lah understood I mean
I'm trying my best to just keep up with my studies kita pun lagi tiga minute correct kalau you berapa minit babe kat situ
okay so aku pun tengah trying to keep up lah with my studies I mean I'm left with just err semester five six and seven so semester seven I'll be in here in singapore doing my internship
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia lah unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so err I did ask macam consulted over there lah like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like macam temporary contract eh
so aku tak nak ambil contract I aku rasa it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that kau kena cari err rumah then on top of that kau kena settle your visa and all those shenanigans so aku cakap no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
but you see ah the thing is I aku because I'm here mah so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so kalau kalau if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network lah and the end of the day aku pun tak sure lah what kind of err prospects I want to do
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the um I mean that's that's the thing that aku aku don't mind doing lah but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
punya sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe err
err take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day err in language pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa unless you are really passionate and interested in it lah
ah what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best lah but I'm just glad that my study punya period is going to be be done and over with very very soon
it's not tak kuat sangat ah but

and then after that my friend told me like oh kau tak mabuk kau panjat pokok habis after that like the this lah she was the one yang like jaga me because she don't drink then they know like I'm a handful
so like she turned around like she couldn't find me then she turned around then she saw me climbing the pokok then she's like ah turun then I was like no go away I'm peter parker and after that I started climbing higher
ya then nasib baik sia but it's
so ya like I I satan satan tapi bodoh
not not like the not like the creepy satan but the bodoh satan
aku nak aku nak pergi nak pergi jumpa kawan kawan eh like then after that kita tengah joget joget so usually when I go
like clubbing and K I'll go with my friends and then after that we just joget joget together like just guys it's just like playing around by ourselves then after that at one point of time there was this group of girls
also happened to be there and then after that they like trying to like like my friends all like ikut dia orang ah
I sendiri
and after that this girl came up to me then after that she like started macam joget depan I
and after that I pusing belakang then I was like eh bodoh sia lah sempit sia and then I the girl then I they all were like what the fuck sia
kesian the girl tak buat salah sia kena
marah ya sia
hose testing tu apa like you just turn on the thing ah
oh dah buat salah sekarang buat baik pula
baik hati ah
merepek sia
what time you balik
ya okay lah that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like turun
tujuh setengah kan
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I malas so I tidur I tidur in like the they have like a mass hall but atas ah on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else tidur on the first floor and then I tidur on the second floor
habis naik atas like pukul satu pagi then I was like eh ma'am I I go sleep first ah then she like oh K K I see you upstairs
bangun pukul sembilan pagi sia
when I when I went back into the office sia lah semua day crew and then they all like eh you this shift what why you come late then I was like no encik I night shift sia
ya pukul sembilan bangun
then after that nak kena sign out kan the reservist nya attendance sheet
night shift nya semua paramedics dah balik then I was like eh encik macam mana sia then he's like ah never mind I sign for you I sign for you
takkan nak begitu sia lah
balik on the dot sia
orh me and my friends selalu keluar eat breakfast lah so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics balik station ah
one time we naik basikal
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already pergi entah mana nak makan lah or something then my friend kata eh sia lah aku tertinggal aku ni barang ah
then after that we cycled back and then we masuk the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper macam
habis dia orang keluar then after that the suay suay the is like oi bicycle siapa ni then I was like encik encik bukan saya punya bicycle
eight bicycles like parked beside the siapa tak bingit sia
twenty percent a quarter of them ah dapat shock
no most of the time if dapat shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
so the pulse dah balik ah
no no when was the last time the patient like dia orang sampai dia dah dah gone kan so like how long before that did they last see him
orh like depan mata ah
kadang eh the
when I went back reservist the medic told me sekarang they make it compulsory sia
kena like you you have to have the my responder app
then after that sekarang dia orang enforce like you have to download
then after that if you dapat the notification kena pergi ah I mean if you tak nampak then bo pian lah but
apa lagi case err the community responder was
habis the this the this captain the the dia dulu macam medical officer
habis my my kawan nampak dia tengah belakang was like belakang selalu macam lepak lepak ah
then after that dia nampak the captain dia terus eh sia lah
my the the responder is captain ah then after that he told us macam
macam take charge of the scenes semua then I was like eh sia lah uar uar sia aku give kau lesson engkau buat bodoh jer macam tu
one of my last few duties ah like my err the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate sia resuscitate the patient dapat we gave like I think three or four shocks
but the nyonya was quite tua already
the dia orang dah tolong this nyonya out of the toilet then she terus collapse so like right from the mata ah then they immediately call
eh usually cardiac arrest kalau pagi pagi kan it's usually a macam orang baru bangun baru bangun then they jumpa the body then it's like dah beberap jam ah so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you dapat cardiac arrest
tak boleh save ah
and kena buat betul betul lah that time apa lagi
err my last duty in like my last duty ever kena dapat call the this ah pek he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we sampai and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court ah
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor datang so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor buat you know like got a there's a pace one when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
then doctor buat macam macam jackhammer sia don't know what
macam begitu then after that macam eh pukimak ini apa sia ini rabbit pe and then after that my paramedic my paramedic tengah jalan
then lepas tu he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
sia lah dia buat apa sia then I was like betul in public K buat betul betul
the doctor the doctor buat sembarang then we after that we all like what the fuck sia the doctor you know
that's why like tak tahu malu ke like
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew kan you will gaduh over who gets to do
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you kena letak the lah the set up the set apa
buat the adrenaline kasi the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you buat salah you kelam kabut you don't give it to the paramedic on time kena maki
so like everybody will gaduh over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I penat
I know my encik was the one who came up with the vehicles sia there like that was his project
I think ya tak salah I heard they got the thing for macam orang morbidly obese
cause the normal the normal alpha sekarang is fucking kecil sia like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
mm the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also boleh
the new alpha is freaking sempit sia like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite sempit already
plus the dengan the stretcher kan
like you don't need to angkat the stretcher like you just picik the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves bodoh tak nak taruh in ambulance when we actually convey patients ke mana yang sedia
rabak sia
wait the the guy also a medic ah tu
actually ah the my last cardiac arrest case like bila balik reservist ni we also turn out with and then after that I nampak kan
so far dia orang asyik suruh the boy yang buat then after that yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian sia
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like tak
like lepas tangan so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment ah like we put in the apa tubing semua
and then after that so like free up free our hands lah so the crew yang buat
and then after that like I tak pernah nampak anyone wearing orange bunker gear buat so far is selalu the firefighter
tak ah
what you all turn out pakai bunker gear pe
tak stress ah
oh then nasib baik sia nasib baik ada the fire fight
sekarang it's that's damn short sia so dulu dulu during my time kan the attachment was like two dua tiga tahun begitu
so like basically the whole and then semua turun then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is ah like I'm sure there's like some
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people buat the medical staff lah the semua
but then sejak COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
apa fire site
I get lah if you want to be ons but tapi ko nak kacau reservists buat apa sia
baru juga ah
double meaning tu apa sia
so it's basically covering the punya
oh so if turn out then you ikut if turn out also you ikut ah
oh rabak
rabak pe
penat ah
mana siap lah at least you dapat
last time tak ada kan your tak ada you get to face
a'ah mampus I I loh
then macam kawan pekik
the officer just bawa lah then he just continue
ya tak probably ah
but I already do two cycles tak pernah dapat sia the card terlupa
then tak pernah they never give
the no lah it's not like we go through the full benda lah cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
and then they have the mannequin habis kena buat lah then they measure
I think it's just paper work ah so they like when you balik reservist then they said like oh we all got the cert already so we can turn out for cardiac arrest
was you ajar I
you taught me the hiemlich kat rumah atuk
I remember you that time you you masih botak I think you still in that time then you got to
and you keluar apa buka and and then after that you you told me right eh you know what I learnt or not then you started doing the hiemlich on me ajar pe
I had I had one this one time in got this one nyonya she said like oh I I'm choking
and then after that we sampai sia lah this nyonya fucking waste our time sia then she like mati mati she said like oh I can feel it in my throat I can feel it in my throat then we asked her what you eat she's like oh
that one is a different bodoh like if you are if you are actually choking you cannot talk but you should be able to sign if the person is right in front of you you confirm can like sign say you choking what
but like if you can berbual and tell the operator on the phone that you are choking then after that the the ambulance sampai
then you can buka the pin you can walk to the door buka pintu then you like oh I I choking just now I ate this nut I can feel it in my throat
I turned to my paramedic that time I that time I tengah ah so like my perangai already like like half fuck ah
then after I turned to my paramedic then after that he like I I told you macam cakap buang masa sia then after that my paramedic's like eh lain kan lain kan
then after that she takut then I was like then what the fuck you want sia
bingit sia
ya but I orang
my paramedic penakut so he convey
ya orh it's more of like he malas want to
ya she mati mati want to go
that one I bingit
like my friends all they say like oh sia lah they they malas want to turn out for like rabak punya call
but like I'd rather go for rabak call then the call is just waste my time
I mean macam ini kes bodoh bodoh sia then it's just like naik marah sia
got one time apa lagi this budak dia dia dia call ambulance dia kata like oh I I I tried to kill myself so we gotta rush down lah we thought like apa jadi
cepat cepat ah pergi
then we sampai already then we ask him what what what did you inject you tell us specifically so we like dia orang cari macam bleach bottle ke apa on the floor then he said oh I swallow this uh I swallow coins
the budak the budak call
or whatever then after that he complained complained complained then I was like no no no why you swallow the coins like you you want to kill yourself I understand why the coin then he like I don't know what to do then after that my paramedic marah me he's like eh abang kau tak boleh main main then I was like it's a legit question though what the fuck
ya after that my paramedic like he my my paramedic don't let me talk to the patient already he like kau duduk kat tepi kau main main
that one pecah nyawa nyawa on another level and that wasn't me there wasn't me that wasn't me I that one I tak berani the the kind of thing I don't play
ya then after that you baca
they they cari you cause you're the only one who can baca quran kan
like the where they simpan all the sets semua
he panjat
exactly pukul satu pagi sia why you telling me this now wah you fucking asshole
then dia orang tak dengar dia pukul pukul dia pintu ah
tak tak sangat ah
so you say later you sneak out again malam malam betul
boy karipap kesian sia
ah tomorrow I have to go cari my
so I need to cari my the baju for her wedding
so kena cari like the so like she got five bridesmaids
three girls then me and another guy so the girls already got the baju then she want all of us to have like matching colour so besok we have to go cari like a baju that matches the colour
go cari the baju
the semua tempat jual baju kurung ah
kat tampines
huh like her tempat kerja offer then you just get free flu shot
oh ya you what you doing tomorrow eh wait so kau kerja
start balik
mm pada pendapat saya
kalau boleh I want a fit body because err I suka main bola err football kan
so err kalau I'm more fit I can you know run faster err I can play better I can improve my performance ah in game
kan you tahu I main untuk err kelab bola
err dan
apa tu err
err I juga suka pergi gym I like
bila I go to gym I
of course kadangkala like of course everyone wants to have good looks lah you know you go out then if take photo with friends or what or like you know you want to get girlfriend all you need good looks what so err ya lah ya got pros and cons lah for both but
err mungkin I pick the fit body lah
mm yang tu betul juga err
going by that thought process kalau gitu mungkin I pun nak ah good looks ah sebab
err macam you kata pe good looks tu err semua genetics tapi fit body I can I can train you know I can work for it especially now we are young right so fit body is a bit easier to get lah you know then
err tapi bila dah tua err semua tu good looks semua
habis lah jadi
kalau long term
aku rasa fit body lebih penting lah sebab untuk err general health and well-being kan
illnesses you know heart problems diabetes ke apa
err kalau gitu
mungkin kan sekarang everyone err selalu cakap pasal err global warming ni global warming tu our climate change ke apa I mean you just look at our weather lah everyday also in the forecast also always wrong one they say rain won't rain will be so hot then kalau err hujan pun
can have sun sometimes then it's like macam air panas aje
so I feel like err humans will go extinct from like all these like global global warming factors lah err mungkin like slowly over time when the sea levels rise ke then all the you know kampung by the the seaside all will become flooded and stuff like that or like mungkin will have err
lebih banyak err natural disaster semua
tsunami ke gempa bumi ke
extinct mungkin kalau macam sekarang ada COVID kan tu virus
tu virus semua like
especially kalau tengok err kalau singapore okay lah sekarang itu case semua sudah fall a lot right
mungkin dia orang punya culture semua berbeza kan jadi
err mereka suka peluk semua kan jadi like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
ini dua faktor lah yang mungkin akan ah menyebabkan err we as humans to go extinct lah
you cakap pasal africa kan tadi aku ingat lah err kat sekolah we learn about econs right err they always talk about the income inequality increasing and all that like and then they talk about the millennium development goals then aku teringat lah pasal err err extreme hunger err yang disrupt disebabkan oleh poverty kan jadi
I feel mungkin that's another reason lah there could be the could be the factor or the the cause of like err humans slowly like the population reducing lah I'm not sure if you boleh sampai extinct semua tapi
err I feel like it could reduce their population a lot overtime if the let's say you know econs they teach us they measure by gini coefficient right if it keep increasing increasing the rich get richer yang miskin jadi lebih miskin then um
err all these err kind of err things like malnutrition all also can increase the diseases and all that because your immune system tak kuat kan jadi
the income inequality makin naik and the
ya lah so maybe the if the government don't do um anything to tolong kan the orang yang miskin orang yang
tak mampu then um
maybe lah this could be a factor that might contribute but mungkin err bukan main cause lah untuk err menyebabkan err apa tu err extinction of humans
skill tu you like do you mean like err
if that's the case right I mean maybe untuk saya lah err
I hope to be able to how to say macam like
boleh read people better lah
cause kalau gitu I can I boleh faham apa yang orang tengah fikir tu and I can like um
I err mungkin err bukan saja cara you cakap tapi err
mungkin err body language intonasi semua err
err ya lah itu like that's one of the first skill like I feel like err would be very beneficial lah and it's bukan satu skill yang senang untuk belajar pun it's like
lebih banyak confidence ah like especially um
dalam scenario macam public speaking depan err banyak orang
um like stage confidence lah not not just speaking you know maybe like anything in front of a large group of people lah but like err buat err presentation ke err nak buat acting ke err
anything that has to do with like err maybe a high pressure situation or err like situations with like other consequence kan macam like pertandingan bola ke where there's a there's a price at hand you you can you can dapat something lah you can win something at the end of the pertandingan ah so
like this kind of err situation where you tend to put pressure on yourself or a lot of people watching you like let's say ada coach yang tengah scouting err player yang err baru yang young talent semua
err I feel like it's it's a very useful skill lah next time bila nak kerja semua kalau boss aku err suruh err buat presentation depan err colleagues aku semua then you know if I have the confidence I after preparing all my things I can present well do a good presentation dia orang semua faham apa yang I nak cakap
then um kalau the third skill maybe err
like being more optimistic err positive fikiran semua err mindset
nak err aku nak yang
lebih ceria lah like I punya mood semua like
I feel like kalau any problem aku hadap
if I face it with like a a a positive mindset err kalau err as hard as it can be susah ke tak susah I can I can convince myself motivate myself to go through whatever struggles and skill ni penting cause it can help me to push through like let's say um
err gym kalau aku penat ke apa my next my next set I can just err keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind I focus on my goals and I just pursue them
besides gym lah like err bola ke like next time nak kerja ke anything in life like I I feel like ni ni benda ni confidence dengan yang positive tu err sangat penting lah but ia bukan skill yang
senang untuk err cultivate ini skill err mesti
ambil time yang lama lah mesti build up over time tapi kalau sekarang I boleh dapat ah tiga-tiga skill ni wah paling best ah
oh third one macam like err it's like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
apa-apa pun boleh lah
wah kalau free tu
tapi kalau gitu overlap macam skill kan bukan saja benda physical
sekarang sekarang benda yang high value kan yang kita kena bayar banyak
err let's say err gold ke or stocks yang property ke apa
bila you cakap free kan
free untuk kita sendiri ke free untuk semua orang
kalau gitu stocks lah kerana kalau I boleh dapat stocks yang banyak
I boleh jual I boleh dapat wang lagi yang banyak lepas tu I can just use it to spend on whatever I want lah whatever else I want because by then I'll be rich what
dia percuma untuk saya tapi untuk orang lain orang lain kena bayar jadi the value is still there but only for me is free so I can use this method to I can keep purchasing all these stocks especially now you look at tesla ni semua
err apa-apa lah yang err involve dengan benda teknologi
semua ni benda err dia punya stocks semua naik naik exponentially lah
if I boleh dapat ni benda semua I I can just you know err
then from there I can build up my wealth I can become rich boleh tolong keluarga saya kawan-kawan saya semua you know I can I can whatever that is material I can dapat dengan wang err I can I can have lah
like time is limited lah setiap hari tak ada dua puluh empat jam sahaja
I tahu lah kita tinggal di singapura ni singapore so small right they always say like you want to get to one side of the island to the other side is a short time only compared to other big countries but
kalau you boleh teleport you nak pergi kerja pergi sekolah you know you want to visit your friends family wherever in the world also
just having that additional satu dua jam setiap hari I mean it could be even more for some people because
you can get more sleep your tidur is good you err
your health pun lebih baik um
you know you nak err like
ada orang kan yang
dia orang err very stress at work or that they are they live very busy life all consumed by their work
but until dia orang takde masa untuk keluarga
tapi bila ada lebih masa ni you boleh spend time dengan keluarga ke girlfriend ke apa you know your family time is a is a very err important thing but I feel like in today's world is err is lacking lah because err people who are always in a rush no not enough time because of
travelling and all that you know like selalu kalau err jalan sesak traffic jam or accident hujan ke then you waste even more time lah so if you can teleport around you know I mean unrealistic lah but superpower right so if you can teleport around of course ideally not just yourself lah if other people also then you nak pergi holiday over the weekend pun boleh apa err so
you as a as a person your like whoever is around you lah cause you can teleport you yourself and then semua sama-sama pergi mana-mana pun boleh
are you more of a marvel fan atau you lebih suka
mungkin hulk lah kerana
dia tu like
he's still a normal human being lah but bila dia marah then then only dia transform kan jadi like
if I'm always having to be seen as the superhuman superhero with superpower then like I feel like the expectation terhadap diri saya akan it will be very high lah from everyone from myself all but if I can still be like a normal human being at the same time as being a superhero
tapi like as needed lah I can I can still possess
kalau you
untuk saya I feel like a lot of people like sebab I banyak training like
like err semua orang selalu label me as like err buff strong whatever
especially dulu bila bila eh err start of this year right when I had the shoulder err shoulder surgery and all that
whenever I am injured lah like not just the shoulder surgery actually like dulu I pun ada ankle sprain ni semua
I selalu err rasa macam
hati tersinggung sikit lah kerana like
um be at the level that high level of fitness um because everyone err selalu tengok saya macam
like bukan sahaja uh dari segi performance tapi like
bila I ganti baju pun kawan saya pun selalu kacau saya pasal err
badan saya lah jadi like if I feel like if I'm not on point at one point also like
as much as pressure tu tekanan tu
boleh tolong untuk err drive you motivate you tapi like if you don't know how to manage it you don't know how to handle it or you let's say you memang your mood
it can affect you sometimes and like it can pull you down even further lah you boleh cause itu macam apa tu dia orang panggil macam spiral
jadi susah sikit lah untuk you nak um
terukan aktiviti harian lah or your
because everything needs your willpower right like even you nak ganti baju nak pilih baju apa untuk pakai pun it takes you like some willpower to think about what you are going to do so like when you are lacking that willpower you memang bukan malas lah tapi like you really not feeling it like you just don't want to do any anything you nak just like
is it can become a real mood killer lah as much as like oh you think like err having this fit body like we said earlier lah tadi um
biasanya dilihat sebagai suatu label yang baik lah tapi
mungkin at times can be a bad label also lah I feel but
I feel like this is the paling paling common lah yang label yang semua kawan-kawan saya
dream occupation saya is err to be a physiotherapist kan so
also in five years six years time lepas uni depends on my situation lah if especially
kalau I masih single ke I dah attached because like if I have someone else then I have to
like err bukan sahaja keluarga tapi ni
I need to of course like devote some portion of my time to that person lah but okay err kalau kita assume tak ada orang tu I masih single I
masih tengah focus on my own goals
err lepas habis uni I'm probably be bonded to err one of the err government hospital kan
my work hours mungkin tak akan flexible sangat jadi
whatever free time yang I ada mungkin like
sekali seminggu lah I I will just contact my family and all then just check on them and then like um like how to say like
I I still go to the gym you know err kalau tak cukup masa maybe just a short workout lah empat puluh lima minit ke apa
you know and ideally would be of course with a with a friend lah cause kalau you train seorang-seorang pun err after a while it it kind of
could be a bit boring sometimes could be unmotivating and stuff tapi ideally if you have always have err
a training partner especially a training partner who selalu banyak tenaga banyak tenaga very like
energetic you know err selalu err give you a lot of vocal cues you know pushing you
bila dia spotting you kan then err I feel like that that would be ideal lah like this is the this is the minimum that I hope lah I just
um berharap like next time I I dapat macam work life balance lah orang cakap like
kerja pun I dapat dream job I I enjoy my work I boleh tolong orang like especially like if I can
become like a private sports err physiotherapist after I dah habis I punya bond dengan err hospital government hospital right and um
at that time I will look back and like I as an athlete like I did I sometimes and I need but like I tak tak cukup duit lah because this kind of service all can be quite expensive lah but I hope to be able to
tahap yang paling tinggi lah because like
bila dengan pertolongan daripada physiotherapy ni err you punya muscles semua like
boleh recover lah you punya recovery semua err lebih baik you you
jadi like
I tak dapat jadi I nak kasih orang lain untuk experience especially athlete athlete yang masih muda masih ada potential untuk
tak tahu lah mungkin boleh represent negara ke apa err ya like
that's that's the idealist scenario untuk saya lah like
bila I kerja pagi ke apa or mungkin I gym pagi err kerja sampai malam tengok lah then
but of course kalau I dah ada err orang lain dalam in my life lah like I have a girl then of course I need to you know like she'll probably be working also so
depending on our schedule lah but I will try of course try my best to make time for her you know maybe sekali seminggu just like we go out for like a date night or something like that just to maintain the relationship lah cause I feel like it's
kasih you punya masa kena sacrifice sikit lah untuk dia cause um
oh ya cakap pasal itu I forgot one of my passions is also to
err kayuh basikal lah jadi like
ideally if if my my working hours pendek sikit um
I boleh slot in masa untuk err girlfriend masa untuk err gym tapi juga untuk err cycling lah and
paling best kalau I ada satu kumpulan cycling macam like a cycling bukan maybe not like a very professional team like just like a cycling group lah then
like every maybe bila tak panas lah maybe
early morning ke err lewat malam ke then
we just you know ride around singapore together road cycling ah road cycling bukan err trail riding
dia memastikan yang I masih aktif lah bila I dah tua nanti
kerana gym mungkin after some time like bila dah tua err apa tu
you punya joints semua mungkin ada another problem lah tapi cycling
err dia punya risks tu rasa kurang sikit lah
you you ride a bike on the main road or jalan raya kan
I feel like err asalkan you it could err ikut peraturan jalan raya semua you follow the rules you just play safe lah you are you pakai lights all you are well seen and especially if you ride in group lah is safer cause you can or like look out for one another and you
I bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa I just like for casual for enjoyment like
untuk err general health and well-being sahaja lah but
it's a fun way lah for me untuk untuk dapat kan err
kerana gym
you punya cardiovascular health you punya jantung semua tu tak akan um
won't be trained as much lah tapi kalau nak buat cycling ke untuk you lari ke apa your
your this apa cardiovascular health will err naik ah you will improve boleh maintain semua
jadi um
err in the long run lah is aku rasa suatu yang penting tapi mungkin
err tak boleh dilakukan tapi kalau ideal scenario I nak lah kerana
each ride will take about what dua jam
so it's it's quite time consuming the sense cause kalau gym empat puluh minit you know you go in go out get it done
it's it's it's okay lah but err kalau cycling you kena gear up semua you
jumpa kawan and then you go for your ride it it takes a while lah and mungkin along the way sometimes we have like a pit stop just for coffee or whatever break you know just some minum slight makan just snacks then
foodpanda dah takde agaknya asal nak
oh you mean that time uh masa masa uh masa collect that time eh takde that time when I collect kan takde orang pun dah habis dah dia orang cakap ada seribu jer helmet

uh dekat uh poly macam ni ah the the normal the five poly's one of them so uh bayar ah ke oh diploma
oh bagus eh tapi tapi dia join dia join under uh full time staff or contract staff
contract tapi dia tolong untuk further studies oh that's good ya I think most likely dia dah dapat diploma dia akan take dia akan take
oh okay okay then uh ada apa-apa lagi tak kerja yang macam
mm bagus lah tu
kalau ah
okay lah tengok ah macam mana rezeki nanti try lah
apa tengok apa ada opening apa lagi
the the uh turkey right ya yang tujuh setengah tu jangan lupa so nak beli apa untuk alesya
for spark ke X one R
oh actually okay very simple okay untuk motor-motor uh spark atau motor X one R ni
takkan sentuh satu benda pun selagi tak bayar owner dia duit
so akan just naik jer
dua-dua uh under ayah punya nama bukan nama kita kereta jer so um
dia punya plan kan is uh dia punya plan uh kalau
uh dah ada motor yang bagus
ataupun kalau takde tapi nak naik yang ini so akan uh beli lah buy over so bayar ayah let's say X one R X one R worth berapa sekarang
okay so maybe bayar dia dua ribu beli beli dari dia okay okay ni just misalnya lah so kalau betul-betul nak buat something eh uh uh nak pakai X one R tu jadi spare and nak nak repair hantar kat rumah kan so kita nak kena bayar dia jadi kita nak keluarkan nama dia so akan bayar dia just like token ah I takkan bayar full sum okay motor not good condition so maybe dua ribu lepas tu uh baru hantar kedai baru akan taruh duit
so sekarang tak bagus jangan kacau apa-apa because motor tu takde nama takde full ownership so macam tu lah cerita dia so sekarang bila naik kan dia dia punya motor dah start bising tapi dia kata dah adjust
chain tapi tak tahu ah kena try lagi
sebab dia sebab dia bising apa ah
tengok ah macam mana so tu lah plan dia kenapa ada siapa-siapa minat bawa X one R atau nak betulkan berapa banyak motor nak ada ya tapi faham kan that means kalau sesiapa nak lumba
tahu tapi faham kan because selagi benda tu kita punya kita tak boleh ubah
nanti dia akan jadi part dua so nak buat apa-apa pun nak kena beli over itu motor atau at least letak duit jadi tutup story tu nanti lah dulu tengok kasih kita fikir because ada chance uh uh I prefer uh lagi suka nak beli motor uh apa nama dia
uh lupa lah nama dia uh no no bukan kapcai uh yang macam uh azri nak bikin tu apa nama dia ya tapi uh no two B two B tu kirakan uh dia kirakan bukan W two hundred kirakan nak beli yang siap dia dah bikinkan ah mm so kalau uh tu kan banyak pakai duit kan so kalau nak beli nak nak pakai duit untuk motr gitu then
takkan nak buat nak spend tu duit untuk motor motor kapcai gini
so uh sampai kita dah beli motor idaman uh jangan fikir langsung nak buat apa-apa dengan X one R ni
ya tu plan dia lah tapi
it's this um objective dia sama selagi motor tu ada tuan dia jangan pandai-pandai godeh kau siapa yang nak jawab
ya lah so tu jer lah cara dia uh kalau betul-betul nak kena beli jer ah jadi uh takde orang akan bising
itu jer lah
mm so uh bagus tak idea kita
boring tapi kalau kita dah ubah suai nanti kalau ada apa-apa masalah siapa yang nak tanggungjawab
mm fikir tapi okay lah nanti bayar dia dulu lah tengok lah
uh apa cerita dengan abang yang dekat hougang tu dia nak bawa uh dia nak dia dia masih nak bawa delivery tak
ke tu saja jer dia cakap apa dia cakap apa
ya then when you tell him that what did he say it was was he serious or he was just uh just berbual kosong
then um kenapa uh sekarang baru nak buat ni pasal dia selalu ada uh apa free time apa dia tapi dia kat rumah main game kenapa dia tak pergi buat this delivery job
so sekarang dia dah relax ah baru ada time
kurang lah
dia nak buat delivery ah
eh dah bilang dia nak kena bayar uh bag dia semua dia cakap apa
okay tapi tak cakap apa-apa pun senyap jer so maybe berbual kosong ah
tengok ah macam mana
eh oh okay nanti dia datang rumah tengok ah dia ada cakap pasal ni ke tak
so dia nak beli motor apa yang kat bawah tu
mm a'ah tak faham pasal uh bukan ke uh start topic ni cakap pasal dia nak kerja delivery so kalau dia nak kerja delivery kenapa nak pinjam duit untuk beli motor scrambler macam motor dia bawa dia patut pinjam duit untuk beli motor biasa motor kapcai hmm
tapi uh okay so kirakan takde link ah dengan delivery sekarang ni pasal dia nak ada link juga
nak dua ah delivery and also untuk dia
tapi dah dah bilang dia lah kalau nak bawa delivery pakai uh scrambler susah
so boleh nampak kan yang macam tak make sense kan oh uh tahu tak bila dia mati eh
tahun depan so that's why ya
then dia cakap apa kenapa kenapa dia terkejut
then dia cakap then dia cakap apa
ya jangan main-main bilang dia kalau dia buat benda ni dia akan kena boleh kena buang eh
tahu tapi tahu tak tu boleh jadi dia jangan jadi viral
ya lah so so kerja apa shift but ah by the way dah boleh kerja roo tau
dah boleh start kalau nak dia bayar bagus tau tadi sebelas dollar sepuluh
oh macam surcharge gitu ah oh
ya but I didn't uh tapi tak tahu tau yang dia naikkan dia punya docket pasal hujan ingatkan pasal distance pasal distance dia pun jauh juga
berbaloi uh apa um apa lagi eh ni deliveroo ya so dah boleh naik dah boleh uh log in dah
then ah grab pun dah boleh
tapi grab is lima dollar kalau satu trip deliveroo uh equals to tiga no uh dua trip grab
ya ya tapi tak tahu tahu uh the distance uh pasal that time roo punya is jauh
tapi jauh bukan jauh gila ah jauh macam jauh paya lebar
a lot of things ya a lot of things changed lah I mean um I mean my habits and err routines banyak dah tukar ya so especially sekarang kena work from home so that sort of things that you have to adapt to yourself ya
so so nak tanya sikit so you rasa this COVID right have err actually changed you to be a better person ke you rasa macam COVID is such a you know is making your life difficult
ya the good thing now you boleh spend time dengan parents you kan like you know more more time to get home you know daripada keluar because there's not much to do outside and and you cannot kita tak boleh travel so there's a lot of restrictions going on ya
so sekarang you have a new skill lah you the pro lah kan when it comes to like designing
boleh buat poster lah ni you know like marketing advertising okay not bad uh that's interesting okay
yes ya last time I feel like err it's such a waste I'm repaying every month untuk for netflix then sekarang macam it's a good thing I'm subscribing it and I'm utilizing the
ya or probably do some activities like err cycling you know ya probably I mean err tentative now the weather has you know ah you tahu lah kan weather dia sekarang nak hujan
hujan sekejap you know panas so I'm not sure if cycling is a good activity to do this weekend but it's just err tentative plan
oh really dekat dekat town is it bali lane okay
I should I should try ah I should pergi and you know mesti mesti weekends long queue kan and there's a lot of um
jadi dia tak macam ya they block the seats lah okay
okay true tak tahu eh sekarang ada movie apa yang best I mean dah lama juga tak check online usually now because we prefer to watch it online jadi um for us to go physically to the cinema macam
cause you punya orang suka advance planning is it ya and also you kerja shift kan and also pasal your um off days
I I I also prefer um cause I have a schedule so I actually like it when um someone make plans in advance so macam teratur sikit your you know your week for the week so ya
kalau orang buat advance planning err
kalau orang buat advance planning and then err you know suddenly they screw up or they couldn't make it and especially kalau kita plan big um occasions or err you know like err birthday parties or anything then lepas tu cancel it will be very hard you know
I mean if if you don't like something you upfront about it err you know I mean if you keep it to yourself then I I somewhat later I I found out about it I'll be very marah you know I'll be like very angry or like why are you not honest kenapa you tak just you know admit things that you you don't like
so that's one thing that I'm very particular about like err because like maybe it's not a good thing kalau you terlalu upfront atau terlalu honest but I believe that if you don't like something ya
ya because I I don't want to like keep things and then you simpan or kalau let's say you marah and then you you keep things to yourself then
uh but you you still not happy about it so you you know macam it doesn't goes well you know I really prefer ya to be honest and let it out about your feelings
so that um you know there's no macam terasa hati that kind of thing
ya lama kenal and then still keep in touch with err it use to be my primary school friend but then as we
instagram or social media ya because err most most of them are married with kids so macam they're busy dengan activity dia orang while
for me like you know I'm still I'm single so it's like I have more time so nak ajak dia orang keluar semua susah so now the best way is to communicate through social media
that's good that's good okay ya that I mean even though um you know tak boleh jumpa and all but the best thing is like at least keep in touch keep in contact tanya khabar you know that's a very good thing
uh ya macam mana you tahu
um playing on my err playlist these few months ever since err COVID has been you know going on so I discover new music um suka um I if I I like one music maybe I'll play a couple of times kalau suka the same music then I'll just have the same
tengah hujan but I know that you are the opposite right you suka loud music kan you don't like macam cooling cooling
for someone who's introvert then suka loud music ya
instrumental as in ada orang nyanyi ke is there anyone singing the music or just the playing instrument
ah tu itu kalau untuk tidur best eh
so I dengar by the way err you recently just start up a small business
kan uh macam yang
oh okay uh apa tu what's that
so macam mana you dapat the idea of um starting up that um small business of yours
so err berapa lama you dah you know venture into this small business
ya betul true
so um now that um you dah venture this err for the trial semua for three months so err what are some of the obstacles that err you actually face throughout macam err susah that you had to struggle along the way just for this business is there anything
actually this is a really a from what I heard from you punya explanation tadi kan I think this is such a good um way you know to to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you
to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you doing this alone or you ada team lain macam
that's good so but but then you are they're also working full time right dia orang pun kerja
mm if you're if you are talking about business um ya there's a few things err on my mind yang I lama lah actually plan out you know like one of them was like doing a set up leather sandals you know that I was planning to create a project err to help you know to actually um
kind of like support um like err you know small err other businesses that can help me to err create a a leather sandal so at the same time I'm supporting them and at the same time they are also helping me err to create err the leather sandals as per what I request yang I suka
err tapi at the same time err that this project is like the money will be going to err those in need is not for my own profit that's one of the project yang I tengah tengok
but then sebab sekarang tengah pandemic so I um um venture out and actually look at the quality and all to um the stuff
err I need to be kat sana physically to be there you know so it's kind of hard to communicate through ya on the phone so that kind of project I need to put on hold dulu lah so I tak boleh I cannot err
through err communication through err whatsapp pun it's very hard cause everything will be sent through pictures and you pun touch the material the quality ya so all these macam err I don't know like pandemic has um kind of like err stop err a lot of um my plans you know ya
so I'm trying to be as positive as possible hoping that maybe next year things will get better for us you know kita boleh travel and
and you know err the economy pun kat other countries err affected kan like err because we have been travelling to support like
other countries you know to to support um you know when as we travel um like like for example malaysia kita semua pergi err to buy things ya all this now sekarang kita tak boleh we cannot go over
mahal ya and everything kind of like limited if you notice macam sometimes you nak look at look out for your stuff tapi dah habis ya people tend to stock up a lot
all this like macam kind of like err a bit difficult for us to travel around and um to look out for things that macam susah nak dapat you know nowadays cause everything um macam senang aje is very easy err to to sold out so you have to
err you know order online you know get it from other country purchase kat you know from other countries and err get it delivered here in singapore so this is like kind of a big challenge but at the same time it makes us you know um be stronger as err you know as a country as a as together
so anyway err okay let me ask you something okay kalau sekiranya
kalau sekiranya err um flight dah buka lah the the the the plane is you can start to buy tickets to go anywhere so the first thing you nak pergi where would you want to go in your mind what's in the first thing on your mind
really you nak pergi morocco
macam dah lama lah it it's on your mind that you want to
oh you dah pergi you have been to norway so you went
kalau macam new zealand ke you know that kind of place orang selalu buat road trip kan you know like new zealand australia that kind of place orang selalu might sewa like err rent a caravan kan or
or do some road trip and um do some macam camping camping punya style lah kan compared to it's not a city vibes punya kind of
so it kalau macam gini you cannot err bring your parents lah kan do you think it's a good place to bring like elderly
ya and also like macam accessibility into halal you know the the food all and
um places to macam err to go to toilet all these kind of things you have to consider because maybe err the elderly might not err err feel that err comfort they they won't feel comfortable to to you know
stay imagine like you know when when you bring your parents to stay in a caravan kind of vibe I tak rasa they might you know they will like it because it's um something new tapi untuk dia orang nak masak ke nak makan they have their own preference kan kalau you notice
because I've experienced before macam err even though my mum is um she likes to travel juga lah kan she's okay with thing we can see that at the end of the day
she will still bring her like macam food lah she's not open to try the food from other countries she will still bring like macam maggi or whatever that is from singapore itself
or macam sambal you know err her own comfort food lah dia still akan prefer that compared to macam to venture out and try all the different kinds of err
food from the country that we are heading to so dia tak akan really macam kalau makan pun sikit aje
just a bit so dia tak akan macam into it
so kalau for me myself when I travel I would love to
ya correct that's why like they always pair err apa on standby they will bring err like sambal on the go you know to correct ya
ya interesting cause we err we get to you know like when you travel with your friends and when you travel with your err family or parents the the experience is different because maybe uh there's a lot of things that macam
might occur you know like um how the pace of how you want to travel the places you nak pergi you kena consider maybe parents not you know not okay with the places that you nak pergi tapi kalau dengan friends you are more flexible there's lot of things that you can do together
ya so macam it it it's something um you know sometimes when I nak travel pun I will consider like should I bring my mum along or um okay lah tempat ni maybe I err just bring my friends you know because of the places that I want to go back but maybe my mum would not um
see the volcano err dekat indo something kan nak naik err the gunung but my mum say that oh tak boleh it's very dangerous you know but my friends will be like hey that's interesting you know ya but we check all the safety precautions err precautions and such tapi my mum will still think that tak boleh you know
ya true ya ya semua tanggung dengan parents
okay um I just love snow okay I suka winter even though
good experience for me to err to finally dapat rasa you know how how it feels like because before this I've never been to any western countries and yang ke mana-mana yang ada snow
so bila I dapat experience snow tu I was like a bit jakun lah then I was like a bit like wow snow and then err at one point I was like okay it's getting too cold ya the the weather was so bad sampai negative the temperature was really bad ya but um
suddenly I was like okay I I cannot stand it I was like okay I'm so glad that um you know I'm staying in singapore cause singapore panas pun panas but I don't have to suffer compared when I was in sejuk dia macam one kind ya
but um still I I suka snow because of I can main I can play with the snow and then err and then the the the season like the vibes um
winter is like towards end of the month I mean end of the year sorry err so dia macam the feeling dia to christmas lagi-lagi macam so you build a snowman you know all these kind of things so I I to be honest even until now
cause like winter kan that's when the only time you boleh pakai thick jackets and then you can
you know you can wear like all the pullovers yang all the seluar kat singapore you tak boleh you know you cannot wear them so this is like a good I always think that way like this is like a good time for me to wear all the boots you know during winter
look different ya but then um ya kind of like waste after that I don't know what to do with the my my all all my jackets semua I tak tahu
it's not appropriate to be to be worn here ya so but now the worst thing is err pandemic so plus points still cannot travel so all these um jackets I'm not sure what should I do with it like should I jual ke you know
or should I buang you know ya
I would really err want to I really nak one thing that I really nak pergi after this err one place sorry err would be japan ya
I've been trying to err but then I heard a lot of things like macam mahal juga lah their their you know like to travel I don't I'm not sure maybe bila pergi japan you pernah pergi kan
korea dengan japan ada ada beza tak what do you think
I think we singaporeans kena belajar eh from them basic manners
I just want to try the train kalau to get to experience dekat japan you know like where the they have bullet train ya bullet train ya
ya I I heard a lot about err pasal japan and the culture and the food and I mean I I heard good food err I mean um that japan has a lot of good food tapi macam when it comes to the
price wise and to travel I heard like it's quite costly but I really want to visit tokyo though like um ya macam tokyo is like one of my destinations that I've been wanting to to to go
maybe next time maybe you can bring me since you dah pernah pergi err japan kan
last time kita tak appreciate err buat travelling kan kita selalu err feel that okay anytime boleh pergi you know next time lah next year but then sekarang when it's really like macam stop us from travel
the feeling is like macam oh all these while especially kalau pasal gambar macam like let's say kita dah frequent pergi that country
ah tak payah lah ambil gambar ah tak payah pergi you know then all these memories macam oh no it's wasted macam sayangnya kalau tahu aku ambil gambar that kind of thing
anything that you nak tanya I
afraid of insect does it count you know even like the small thing small insect like err small spider or semut sometimes I can be like you know
I I tak nak pegang I don't want to I don't want to kill it tak tak nak you know even though kita pakai tissue to throw it to angkat kan ya I'll be like tak nak you know just scared
cicak you know like lizards all these ya
I think it's it's stupid lah because orang cakap like dah mati apa for example especially when it's dead kan then dah mati apa so like just just angkat lah but I still like no I got that fear and
because maybe because um kalau you naik plane then kan ada clouds like covering so you tak nampak tau bawah sangat
and you are in a macam covered closed like you're inside the plane what so tak you tak exposed sangat you know to look down tapi kalau let's say it's a
macam you nak kena jump from a high a high building or something err you have to look down kan so probably for me I'll be very scared to do that but I guess you are you're not right from the way I look at you I think you are adventurous
actually err when I was in hong-kong kan I was scared of cable car ya sorry that was side track err I was in hong-kong so err I naik this err cable car tau you know the three hundred sixty so it's like full glass
so it's err so you boleh nampak bawah your kaki can look through kat bawah so I thought that it's just a normal cable car impossible that I'll be scared naik cable car biasa boleh apa but then when I took the three hundred sixty cable car it was like
you kind of distract because you can see everything so it's all clear and you feel that you going to macam jatuh the feeling
so I guess ya even you naik luge kan you kan dia macam open luge as in the apa yang the skyride tu yang dekat sentosa
ah ya correct that one itu pun macam open apa ya your legs dangling so macam
that one also I won't dare to macam ambil ambil video ambil gambar cause I scared that you know it might drop
so ya so my afraid of heights thing macam is kind of critical ah I feel tapi orang cakap it's quite silly lah but to me it's like it's something that I'm scared tapi orang lain probably they they find it like it's just heights you know
oh so where where did the spider tu apa lari then pergi somewhere like left or you had to kill it you kena bunuh
actually is is that the spider yang you tahu kaki dia like tipis ke ke dia
tapi kan ada kaki yang spider yang tipis ada yang very
I'm so glad like macam kalau singapore tak you you know tak macam sangat lah you know masuk spider but then if you are in kalau macam summer um season that's when the spiders um start to appear in in your house
so they start to masuk because maybe I think it's a it's a great weather to be in but
kalau let's say for example I suruh you err go and pick up a cockroach yang dah mati you boleh lah just use your bare hands angkat macam gitu
just like that angkat kaki dia ke orang boleh you know just
ee antenna okay I mean you boleh angkat macam gitu with your bare hands oh no
speaking of insects kan so err what do you think about orang-orang yang err actually eat eat insects like what what do you think like err is it okay to if let's say someone were to ask you to eat you boleh ke makan cambodian for example they ya they are like kind of into insects
so they it's it's not the same as where you found the insect outside you know macam it's not the the same kind of insect so they kind of clean and I don't know lah what where they found those kind of insect
only if they actually boil it first so it like it it it can macam at least the texture of the the dia punya shell macam edible I don't I don't know how they do it because
pork is part of their you know macam culture they like to eat ya
but I know I can see that you are an android user you pakai samsung so that's so how do how do you what do you think about um samsung
front camera ke atau yang back the back camera
dia punya music dia kan
ya ada yang baru punya you know the the flip phone is it err samsung ya I I saw that it looks kind of cool you know you can just
flip your phone and then like very compact you boleh letak dalam bag you what do you think of that
the middle part tu lah the screen punya macam
quite a lot for iphone you know and then bila they they start to have like ah tak ada charger err you have to buy different kind of you know the the cable now is like a bit different right if you notice kalau you tengok dia punya
bahagian at the top part I think it's different I mean I mean not the top part but as in maybe the the the charge itself I can see the difference with the old err ya the cable wire ya so it's like um
ya ya correct correct so you nak beli the head tu you kena beli a specific a different one ya anyway it's been a great time I got to go you know err I need to you know I'll get back to work so it's it's been a nice time to catch up with you err so kalau nanti free you just

okay okay understand okay and the next question will be what was the most memorable meal yang you ever had where did you actually have it
makan apa-apa ah macam kau pernah pergi overseas apa semua kan
but but was it like you say makan dengan ramen was it like sashimi punya type or is it cook or
oo but then then um the you say mm makan whale kan
macam dia punya texture
so you wasn't you you're like tak pasti juga lah whether it's the it's the isi of the whale of the fats of the whale
uh next question if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life apa yang you will eat like what would it be
the four seasons or you prefer macam singapore punya weather
understand okay so uh when you are in tokyo or japan kan so err for the halal restaurants that you went cause I read somewhere lah in some blogs or articles right that even though for halal restaurants they do actually serve alcoholic beverages betul ke
tu lah that's why I I read at the apa halal travel blogs mm
mm okay tell me recently ada benda like
yes skills ah kira like macam
wah you know so much about this karate martial arts semua thingy
yes so like whatever you have paid for before kan kira macam pada kau when you think back apa yang
uh engkau rasa macam like apakah sesuatu yang kau harap benda tu sebenarnya boleh jadi percuma ah
okay then after that next question ee kita dah nak our time
kalau kita dah dah tak payah kerja ah
kira activities seharian macam apakah yang akan menjadi suatu penyeksaan jika dilakukan selama lapan jam berturut-turut I would say work but
activity ah macam like working out ke
ni interesting gila ni
ah self right like uh nasihat some nasihat what would it be
maybe time time kau poly ah
kira kau poly
okay baik okay let's start the things macam how's things on your weekend
ya I mean tadi ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid dia tidur all the way so my wife ingatkan dia can go to the hairdresser and then just relax kejap lah
you know just have a relaxing hair trim err hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that err because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before balik kerja eh jadi dia nak
dia nak one whole day just pamper sendiri saja lah so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this ah just nice also you err you also jadi to do all these things ya so K lor so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
err while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament punya benda
exactly ya ya that's my idea pun I was also thinking about that actually
ya so ya I also err not been discussing my guys err all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with lah err those that were in the semua tu
so dia orang kata you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when kita takde benda you know like you you there's no real cove lah
like everybody knows kita punya reputation tapi takde takde portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event dulu
the weekly event and then just nice err earlier this week ada there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so dia punya format eh sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee jadi first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so kalau kalau all sixty four players masuk dalam
prizenya tak banyak it is seriously tak banyak actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person jadi the whole prize pool eh baru apa enam ratus six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus dollar pun tak sampai it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league jadi kena main each other for like
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches jadi a a lot of the the response of the company semua tak nak main it's like eh it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars tapi you know like it's nak you you enter that
only top three dapat menang apa-apa and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even dua ratus so banyak orang you know the dia orang tak suka lah all this thing ah so I was wondering but
maybe let's say like of the registration fees kan ninety percent these guys only did like not even half ah what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent tak sampai setengah of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day saja and then err we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves err ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so err what's that called
um so serious because we are our own clients apa
so you know there's kita we can just like borak have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them ah look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars ah because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time saja lah so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
I I I entah eh I also don't know how many people have resgistered tapi the the response I get banyak orang semua semua kutuk ah critics semua kutuk top top white center
now semua kata you know ni apa apa benda what kind of nonsense is this you know buat apa kita main buat apa I mean we play so much habis duit sikit saja then kena main lama lama how many weeks ya lah ada better things to do ah than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no tak tak tak nampak lain ah ada apa eh let me see kalau ada league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
namanya D to sports league entah siapa I langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada nine hundred plus members kat dalam
let's see ada tak berapa berapa orang dah sign up tak ni tak nampak pula eh
tapi nampak macam masih buka jer masih boleh sign up jer
a'ah berapa orang
ah belum tahu ah berapa orang ah kat dalam
tapi ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this err whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so semua orang kata like
so there wasn't even any one they say alah just go for the fun of biar jer langsung takde orang say that semua semua kutuk okay I'll I when I say semua eh it's literally there only like three people that response ah that responded
yang lain semua you know buat buat tak kisah saja
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab ah dia orang just buat ni benda just err make a few posters bilang semua okay eh aku ada league ah you know you get thirty percent kalau kamu menang you get thirty percent
tapi fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything benda senang I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
macam gray macam makan makan makan sendiri ah makan all the community
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event semua kan minimum or I think we can do a uh forty a thirty forty players so takde issue langsung ah
itu pun susah juga kan so I'm so I'm thinking at least kalau kita have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just err macam mana kata eh
every week ada content baru that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
actually nak kata possible eh
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once ah actually nak kata registration fee selalunya berapa
because they're by community centre budget no problem untuk dia punya wang actually it's free registration dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa
so it's just my masuk lah kan but that's for the punya lah um ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play juga then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that lah
tapi for all the events um what ah who ah they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just dia orang just bayar bayar bayar jer so takde registration fee takpe juga untuk dia orang ya but for us we add in lah as much as we want to we are we are okay with
uh how do I say ah ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think alamak one day registration fee sepuluh ketul and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way err let's say registration fee let's say lima ketul lah I I can definitely okay
the more people that join your prize pun naik gila babi
uh one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match kau dah menang tiga dollar
ah duit datang balik tau all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
dah eighty percent eh a'ah sia tu dah banyak juga tu
soon lepas tu kalau dapat masuk to the semi final top four ah
err so five percent each lima peratus satu orang lima peratus okay naik top four
ah kau dapat sepuluh percent lah sepuluh peratus ah
correct so you masuk kalau you masuk quarter final sudah dapat five percent you masuk semi final you get ten percent
you masuk final up to fifteen percent
err mana percent yang
kejap eh so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four eh the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright naik four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool dah removed
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within err apa tu
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent pun boleh thirty percent of the total prize pool
matchmaking pun susah ah ah ya so so that's the thing ah then the list uh ya uneven
ya eh kalau tak some people get a buy then they get their money back eh that's not fair juga eh
thirty two fairly I think eh no problem senang
senang ah senang
ah tu ah
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing kan I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off um so that hopefully we can get our own uh third party sponsors ah takde orang akan kacau kita lah
falls the one that is working with SCOGA ah cause dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat community events sendiri juga
my understanding is that he has his own production punya house or something like that
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that kan we telling him that eh looked operations side kita semua dah settled everything kita dah dah fikir masak-masak and kita boleh you know bawa orang-orang confirm register punya
you know tapi the one problem kan that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA duit no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more err jet ideas
that is what N nadesan has been saying ah kalau duit anything with money ke apa kan with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford kita
tapi so that's that's the thing ah we will be working you know like uh together with SCOGA it won't be our event eh technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
semua ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway lah actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like ah people association entah apa community club lah sports club
south west ni semua so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this err apa dia E delta league
I don't know macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu lah eh tapi organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up oh okay so it's gonna be an offline event ah kirakan ah kalau venue partner dah sports up tapi it's um ah you know like um it's again ah
so basically SCOGA eh in my opinion how they've been running all their events kan sama macam zenway sama
dia orang just buat the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
our venture punya logo whatever it is lah eh we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that uh ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife ah technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event dia tak suka the idea of kita um how to say ah handing over the rains to another person
dia nak kita hundred percent seratus peratus ni event kita bukan orang lain punya this is ours have our name over there for and then of this uh
you know orang lain tak boleh kacau ah senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner kita sure but it's not kita joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
then they'll be like mana nama kau aku nampak nama SCOGA jer nama kau mana
I said oh now we work under SCOGA mana bukti
kita tak tahu SCOGA kita tak boleh you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if kalau kita boleh tunjuk on a poster that has our logo on it
dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa ah they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what ah err we are not not just mere partners or whatever kita tak buat apa-apa but
kita yang run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with ah whoever but they have to be partners it's not kita join dia orang we work under their name
satu orang kena start dulu ah senang kata
tu tu yang juga eh that
and then why I also tak nak like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside semua
tapi there there would seem a little bit of a chip ah then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor kata okay so siapa yang sponsor your previous event uh and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I tengok eh ini kau punya company apa
ah ha ha ha tu yang problem juga
but I think I would okay nak kata our community eh okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like um
I macam mana nak kata uh ada orang kata a lot of times at people sponsor benda kan they don't actually get anything much out of it
junior apa junior what
I think ya I think in the end tu nak buat sponsor tag ah in the end
you know macam mana eh I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now dekat facebook eh all the videos kan it will show how many views ada ada ada rather it will show how many views actually
ah what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views lah apa lah itu semua tak ada um ya even okay right now zenway is live right now sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok some mobile legends punya benda
ya but I don't see any total views belum lagi belum lagi total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show berapa eh let me see another video
ah tapi the problem my my midnight punya shows ah
one play sports videos the problem with semua malam-malam betul ah paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang problemnya
ada ada orang but it's not that much ah okay ya I'm looking here
mm asia champions league semalam nine hundred views err asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
one hour juga ni semua one our cast
but that was the the very first punya lah I mean like it was the first
err but they split it into different parts ah macam part one first two hours ten ten K views
quite quite a bit this four lah but then again eh E sports ada berapa berapa followers ni E sports how many followers
aiman will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask iman pun can we stream it on your stream
or even better if we can get we can rope aiman in as a commentator juga lah
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that lah like how sia macam mana aku nak you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
jadi kalau kalau if there's a way eh for us to go meet aiman I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think kalau kita bilang dia look kita ini kita semua eh kita will ini kita punya event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money ah so maybe kalau dia dengar tu eh the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now dia ada banyak banyak event kan
jadi kalau kalau a'ah sia dia banyak events ah so I don't know what he was bitching to us about lah jadi honestly I was like dude ini it like it ah I look I know you're disappointed E piala malaysia of fucking meeting ah err bullshit I just said ah sorry
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity ah you're winning quantity wise those two guys eh other than E piala malaysia apa lain dengan other dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda
ah lepas
tak tak takde benda sia I can't I ah
okay I know that err see siapa ni matthew eh has uh has uh some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing dari bola tau so you know ah oh kalau nak kata streaming bola jer
dia orang takde benda sia decipher lagi takde benda at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa tau
so ya so he said oh I lost out to them honestly ah it's just connections ah you lost tau on connections ah that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E piala malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
because I know he's been doing singapore events juga
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our chapalang event tak ada sponsor takde apa takde benda
us sepuluh ribu views tau
you know err ya I also can tell it you know ah definitely when I when I let know of my community err this this affinity whatsapp group semua that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block kita ada ah aku aku pun tak tak takde ideas ah apa nak buat like to find my own third party sponsor semua takde idea langsung ah
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or err what ah macam macam kau dan aku yang yang my friend hafiz the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that kan
I broached either to him by eh nak sponsor kita tak you know this sort of event then kalau kau betul-betul managed to get them in eh aku bagi kau you know some some credit or whatever lah some kickback lah so dia kata
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage dia orang tak langsung tak support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
officially eh looking at their website eh dia kata ah they are a youth non profit organisation
kalau nak under official words ah
um ya they have err few initiatives lah all this err E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya err and they let see apa lagi dia orang ada eh about us
uh ya so apa ni executive committee
nicholas aaron khoo macam familiar jer nama tu
last kakak kerja dekat intern twelve cupcakes
um kak kerja as baker um tolong macam
ah kakak dalam err cupcake department macam tolong
apa um ah scoop cupcake better err tolong decoration lepas tu tolong macam taruh
dekat oven ah bakar lah jaga oven semua uh apa kalau ada macam bahan-bahan yang kena refill then akak kena buat
of course penat lah tapi kakak ada macam learn untuk menjadi seorang yang berdikari
um dekat kerja kakak belajar untuk uh apa selalu ada keyakinan diri um
um saling bantu bantu membantu antara satu sama lain uh haruslah komunikasi sebagai pasukan kerana uh apabila kita err ingin melakukan kerja bekerjasama
kami haruslah berkomunikasi supaya kami tahu uh uh dan dan dan kerja kita akan jalan dengan lancar yup
um kadang-kadang ada jugalah ada ada yang kadang-kadang rasa macam mereka lebih tahu
lebih lebih apa macam mereka lebih tahu lah and then ingin menunjuk-nunjuk
ah tapi ah saya tidak apa ni uh kerana mereka rasa begitu kerana mereka takut um mereka rasa ditepi diketepikan semasa bekerja then ya um tetapi
mereka juga um um ada juga merupa bakat yang sangat bagus lah mereka dah sudah mahir dalam bidang itu ya
um selalunya ada ah contoh seperti kadang-kadang aku terlambat ah masuk kerja ah
ah saya pernah terjatuhkan uh apa ni
terjatuhkan cupcake batter di lantai
uh and then habis kotor di lantai ah and then saya haruslah mop
um yang apa yang saya telah berselerakkan eh apa ni um
saya pun juga pernah tidak mengikut arahan err kerana semasa kawan kerja saya err
ingin ke waktu rehat dia telah mengatakan saya untuk jangan membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven tetapi saya degil then saya tetap uh lakukannya
selepas berapa minit kemudian saya apa uh uh bila saya tengah buat kerja saya masing-masing saya
terlupa err yang saya sudah apa membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven saya tidak mendengar saya saya tidak mendengar timer dan ia hangus
err then saya saya amat terperanjat dan juga berasa serba salah kerana sudah membazir cupcake itu
uh uh kawan kerja saya ah
err terkejut juga then menegur saya uh supaya uh saya tidak melakukan kesilapan itu lagi
ah betul kakak telah uh mempelajari untuk mengikut arahan dan jangan bertindak uh sendirian jika tidak pasti kerana kadang-kadang kita apabila kita rasa kami kita
um mungkin kakak ingin err belajar dalam bidang mengajar uh early childhood kerana saya suka berbual dengan uh anak-anak kecil dan juga ingin mengongsi err ilmu yang saya telah pelajari
err pernah satu incident apabila saya di kedai sedang ingin sedang menunggu
sedang apa um mengambil air sambil menunggu saya ternampak seorang budak sedang memain dengan bottle like yang
ia ingin flip bottle itu then
mahu uh ingin bottle itu uh berdiri dan budak itu um err melihat saya dan ingin mengimpress saya dengan dia punya skills then saya saya hanya senyum dan melihat uh adik itu dan um
uh mengatakan syabas kepada dia like good job because dia dapat flip bottle itu dan dia dia berusaha berusaha sehingga dia dapat stand bottle itu
um ya um apa apabila uh
anak anak kecil err um senyum ketawa saya gembira
um memang betul uh susah nak jaga budak-budak kecil sebab kita pun dulu budak-budak kecil tapi kalau kita orang
dah minat dengan err example bidang early childhood um
uh kita haruslah apa um kalau kita ingin tahu macam mana nak jaga anak-anak kecil ini kita boleh belajar dalam bidang early childhood kita belajar untuk uh cara untuk handle um budak-budak kecil ini
dengan but apabila sudah banyak kali uh practice err training
err cara tahu cara technique untuk berbual dengan anak-anak kecil uh yang agak mudah mudah juga
ya um sama seperti ibu bapa juga sebab uh jika we jika kita mengatakan uh mereka
err ada anak then dia orang apa kena um mengatasi masalah itu juga err untuk menghandle anak mereka
um teknologi boleh menjadi err boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah err yang faedah dia
macam dalam pelajaran uh um cikgu boleh memberi assignment kepada murid-murid um err contohnya kalau ada E learning
um anak-anak muda um
murid um dari dari um muda mereka senang untuk catch up um their skills especially in technology
mereka senang untuk uh belajar macam cara nak menggunakan teknologi dengan mudah
dan mereka juga boleh err learn new skills from the internet because um but
yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini err ialah social media um mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan
err perkara yang di luar yang trend yang yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri
err contohnya seperti uh ada seorang celebrity
mereka melakukan trend uh yang mungkin boleh membahayakan dan apabila anak-anak muda melihat itu mereka rasa mereka juga ingin melakukan
ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya um tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya
err dengan itu saya rasa social media err technology haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin
ah untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna technology dengan baik mereka uh uh techonology ialah perkara um it's a safe platform for them
um ya kakak ingat dulu bila kita kecil um kita dulu kita orang uh
usually entertain diri sendiri dengan menggunakan komputer dan ada ada game permainan di komputer dan kami err main sebanyak mungkin ia juga agak menarik
err tetapi uh kami sebab kami
err ada adik-beradik kan uh kami kena ambil giliran
dan kadangkala kami gaduh pasal err giliran siapa untuk memain game di komputer
kami juga um uh di kami melihat err cerita dalam err pada zaman dahulu lah tapi zaman sekarang uh kami tidak pakai lagi kami boleh tengok online saja
ia memudah untuk generasi muda sekarang um ya
second hand phone from you and ayah and

oh pasal dulu my first few choices was uh business business finance abeh aku minat tourism
so I put there only my first six choice ah then my marine engineering was aku nya tujuh ke lapan ah
I not sure but yes ah aku aku tak minat tapi
aku nya points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so aku just kena taruk the aku just kena taruk any course that I can put lah
tapi along the way alhamdulillah
aku minat ah aku minat
aku minat ah aku minat marine engineering nya module
so kau apa sekarang lah like what are you doing in school what are your activities
aku in dikir barat ah as you know
I I always tried to pull you in dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk so
now I really want to know the reason why kau tak nak masuk dikir barat
okay lah boleh boleh
muay thai pun
bukannya muay thai nanti
ada stage fright ke like macam ada spectators tengok
right faham faham I understand
because sekarang pun COVID
then like kita lima hari five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then kadang-kadang
sama juga I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in my apa tu uh younger days ah my sec one sec two menengah satu menengah dua that kind so I
every month bapa kena call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise yang
so that's when aku sedar lah that I have to bulk up kalau tak memang aku takleh survive N or O levels
I did get twelve points ah takleh
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject yang aku ambil
then aku end up in poly now
ya what is the most macam
what is the most naughty thing yang kau pernah buat secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most yang paling
so kira kan self self nominate kau terus masuk
actually talking about yang student student council student leader and
dulu like what you said I was very naughty nakal gila
macam apa aku buat semua aku kena tone down pasal aku chairperson of the class and my school dorang ada selalu macam best chairperson
best leader best apa so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last lah basically macam in the rankings so macam sec three tu memang quite tough lah is like I'm still naughty
but end up nanti cikgu jalan
dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong ah I go angkat
teacher you need help ah then aku angkat aku angkat kan masuk staffroom
so kira like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so aku just suck it up lah
and my teachers in sports leaders suka aku
pasal aku not the quiet type
but students leader punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku naughty sangat so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school lah tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada different opinion about the same person
that's that's being naughty lah dekat sekolah
oh kira tu naughty ah kan
kira tu naughty ah kan
tu bikin kau paling guilty ah kan
guilty tak eh
jadi cikgu tertipu kan
so macam dorang dah bless ah
so lepas O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time ke
aku kerja yang kau tahu volunteer volunteer punya
yang nampak dekat uh fast jobs nanti dia cakap oh you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance ah kira that time too is big money for me know so kadang-kadang kalau ada shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
that was my basically aku nya work for my whole N level till when I go sec five ah
so aku akan kerja all the way
then basically nothing much ah aku just kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
experience aku pernah tau sekali kerja
tiga hari jer off day aku nya gaji at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus
selepas minus
so if anybody interested join staff masuk lah ya so
irony but I do have some problems lah I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama age
the same pemikiran lah basically so aku just
aku just tahan for two months then aku just took adapt aku just try to adapt to the situation lah yang aku aku was in
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly baik gila
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities semua dorang kena beli then they have to keep at home
wah salute ah dorang
I don't dah
oh is not always the sama part lah
like macam
as in aku prefer tau honestly aku would prefer a busy
a busy working environment pasal at least aku ada benda tau nak buat like something to do kalau they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
macam benda ni semua I can see cikgu kita are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be macam very independent because in the future semua benda-benda engineering ni semua
they won't hari-hari tengok kau buat
that's why macam I feel engineering early brush you lah and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop ah
macam betul-betul flop then susah once you know once dah jatuh in poly susah nak naik balik
aku masuk shore which is first first semester so right after this semester aku probably has a month's break then after that aku dah kena masuk intern lah
by dia punya sailing
aku nak belayar basically I just want to go
explore countries negara semua negara england semua whatever lah
uh yang ada ports semua kan saudi arabia ke whatever
so aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak
dapat sailing results must be very strong
so aku legit work very hard
untuk aku year one year two tapi
aku punya type is aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir ah
so at the end of the day aku don't mind shore kalau dapat keppel okay lor
kira very good orh keppel
ya betul
but ya lah you so you are willing lah kau kira willing untuk sail every year six months
time kau balik pun dah penat
so your ultimate goal is to get macam
pasal you are not away from your family too long
surveyor macam benda relax ah
okay ah during during circuit breaker and all we all semua stuck dekat rumah
pelik but yes aku
aku found a love from
karma medic lah nama youtube channel
and aku suka biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class duduk belakang dengar
but ya the love come back and I feel like kalau I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni ke apa
ya so talking about uni kita belum lagi lepas
wayang ah
so ah the frogmen one tu yang paling gerek ah
so aku nak masuk navy tapi aku tahu
aku tahu tak probably tak ada chance lah masuk navy kan
ada chance will be slim
but yes ah so kalau
tak aku nak try my best to go police
kalau police pun
aku kena train banyak so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
kalau tak pun I don't mind
eh pula I don't mind civil defense
tu pun pergi tau sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai
my father never go so aku rasa I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always kena hijau from the trend lah that's what they say lah but no hijau for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring lah my opinion macam gitu-gitu jer ya okay lah tengok macam mana
tapi kalau aku dapat air force who wouldn't take it
chey wah pandai seh tak ah intelligence
what was your score though they never tell you tak bilang
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult ke apa
kalau let's say ke dah dah minat nak sign on
kena berapa bagus wow
ada size dia ah
sekarang berapa years
masih eh masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun jer primary school
bila primary school kan nanti
nanti kita tengok movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there kita semua dah
dah basically know the type of person you want to be like err like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first macam entertainment punya movie show kan was ah
macam I didn't realise tau yang itu semua watak
as in tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua just rekaan tau I didn't know
then I thought macam okay let's say macam dulu undertaker betul-betul lah dia jahat betul-betul lah dia nak nak nak menang jer nak kasi orang sakit
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like macam undertaker
buat mata dia yang roll eyes back
so kira macam last time primary school was one of the best times because
kita explore ah
kita explore banyak benda
satu hari kita undertaker the next day we john cena the next day yuka civi
ya in primary school also dulu kita suka buat banyak parkour
striker yang
bebas like horse kick right
have you ever win the finals pernah menang
who's your bogey team ah macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti
macam you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
for me kalau bab-bab
macam atau activity kan
I was goalkeeper you know you know when kau penjaga gawang in primary school
if the goals you concede so we basically second round kita dah keluar everytime
kita masuk south zone kita keluar kita group stages
then secondary school I was in so kau tahu ada banyak
lah yang joget-joget sambil marching
ah make the police create the league untuk macam orang-orang tak
untuk all the budak melayu not only budak melayu lah budak melayu budak cina there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors semua masuk
tu pun second round kita out
I join dikir barat
I join dikir barat and my first ever performance
so of course after the performance aku nangis siol
aku really my heart was pouring ah
so that that was when my mood for dikir honestly
aku kena aku kena step in to change
for dikir barat
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents ragu-ragu ah
my parents will think eh macam mana aku nya anak nya results
sekolah pelajaran akan jeopardise ke tak
that kind of thing so aku pun macam second guess ah aku second guess but I love dikir barat so much
in dikir barat twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like macam nama engraved dekat dekat kau nya trophy I also never had the recognition of
pemenang dikir barat singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
it's a heavy responsibility tapi we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
macam teaching
your kawan takkan eh coach pasal they coach kau marah dia tapi kau as a kawan kau still tolong that kind of thing
we have our ups and downs juga ah
kau cannot
kalau kau always feel that you are at the bottom
dah kita dah improve at least be happy about it jangan cakap yay tak last
that that that pada aku tu yang paling penting ah dalam
dalam inner change
you can't keep thinking of eh kita dulu last
as in berbual macam single ke attached ke seeing someone
mana lah aku tahu aku dah lama tak jumpa
kau boleh click ah basically
cinta monyet eh dulu
happy ah dapat berbual dengan kau talk to you for an hour get to know you a bit more
and terima kasih ah
dah start lah then you just continue talking
apa like gold shop
oh okay that means if this COVID nineteen dah
is the laksa place still there there was a
mini laksa stall dulu-dulu ah when I worked at Equip
ya lah mak
oh the one yang mask tu is shah
mm mm ya because the the nama I always
your friends all nama sama-sama seh
err going P one dekat mana
oh that um I saw afika posts on dia punya Instagram
because I know because that time I went I notice that um long john was dekat sebelah kan
ya but dia cakap dia tak suka makan like so if she see kalau halal would she try
err lemak cili padi
kak zarina is the one yang kita pergi rumah dia kan
ya I saw periuk-periuk dia besar
seriously but kitchen dia pun besar lah
ya cuti I think then then the next week is err parent teacher meeting lah
so I was thinking besok also can check uh
iyan punya shoes
ya dia um story dia um painted lah like those art jamming like you go
I considered going there monday tapi must book in advance like don't have cannot just walk in gitu
tapi tu like you really paint stuff macam you see gambar and you just paint
I think they usually sorry lah to say but usually kalau put in extra hours they would usually pick the younger ones
but you know it's like it's so obvious kan kalau like the whole team come early tak apa juga
like there are other people who she feels better than her lah gitu
but I also think the the colleague yang nak leave tu like just try sebelum leave just try one shot like you think any possibility to increase my pay since I'm doing more you know that kind of thing then if really you cannot then just quit quit lor
maybe because you feel like aisle way corridor pun tak not safe
can check out art ground yang dulu whether they are open or not
kita tak boleh like impromptu tak boleh
kalau nak impromptu just go to any park
yesterday I was like telling oh dengar lah I don't know what's wrong with them I was like so intent one cause I got like
nak watch or something and then ilan uh err no lah don't want swim
only iyan nak then I'm like
but my main aim is like you know untuk elia like improve her swimming right but I also look at iyan dia punya luka-luka then I was like iyan when you are better okay your chin punya luka eh okay
then so never ah never then ilya nak spring clean
dengar ah dengar ah then on that she wanted to watch the then I say what what did you do
then she was like thinking hype apa nak buat
terus yang dia keluar macam wah so determined gitu I was like dia ni nak buat apa ni

lepas tu suddenly oh vivian house tour kan
so si ilan bangun like super late like pukul sebelas gitu
and then mandi is like I don't know pukul

then I wanted to make err susu for iyan he's he asked for susu
suddenly I saw cicak dekat kabinet tu
like can you drink tomorrow I saw a big lizard then dia cakap oh I saw small lizard just now uh

ya chocolate the snickers dah habis
the new jurong west thing you say right nak try tu
someone who was from the black hole punya
no leh there's a lot like din tai fung dia punya chef open up like own and then sell the famous like fried rice or whatever and so same what from the chef from tai fung
no lor nowadays I saw um um there's this guy teaching like Google Ads punya uh apa course ah and he used to work from Google lah he was like
I think I know what you mean it shouldn't be in the headline but like bila kena interview gitu it's like mm
so I message her yesterday was like eh it was me as just now she was like cannot already see but I know lah and then err and then dia cakap oo then I said um
you free tomorrow err like the baju ah I say
no I asked her then supposed to then I was like cari cari then the thing right I wanted to also pass her targeting maths textbook
baju the ilan shirt right two of them had like the name tag the she helped me unpay
was saying okay lah maybe give me more time to look for the targeting mats lah actually actually then jumpa dekat mana tau I totally forgot to open the
like get rid lah tak ada nampak I mean
half size jer ke
that's the thing about shoes I don't like buying shoes online like tak boleh try seh
so ya but the macam
you get what I mean ada two
so if you had wanted early actually should have given your feet punya
lunar glide that I got my client to help me buy from is because kita try to install
taruk dua puluh ketul then lepas tu
was ilya ni bila
I see okay I ask her lah oh when you have one dollar then I start gitu jer dia dah then I say what is that
then baru dia like
I never teach her timetable lah I always subtraction dengan
dia punya count backwards
like apa um
you get I mean is like what do you do you buy something you still get more money ah or you lose money or you take away and she go oh duit
dia no I find dia tak grasp the concept betul betul
dia cuma like oh I get it but it's not hundred percent it's like maybe seventy percent ah
like ilan is some one senang nak tangkap sebab dia
but for her dia punya ya the concept
then I because I at the same time aku pun spring clean ilan's room I threw quite a lot like all those also gonna throw err except for that cotton on uh paper bag ah tu barang-barang
so much nonsense and so dirty and then oh finally aku tengok karangan and the composition ah
tak lah cemerlang mana you know
even though the thing is like cemerlang for
ya the english one I see not that good banyak
introduction ya ya definitely but you cannot first paragraph jer good lepas tu lousy right
ya Mendaki is so far I don't know why they don't put like they are not located like somewhere tengah-tengah you know central sikit lah
lemau say
Mendaki classes nak nak join
dengan syaril kan
oh betul like really stay somewhere is it
dekat mana seh
kena write about it ah
wait apa eh
entah tak ingat ah whoa I must ask ling about this but I remember is we both were in the same group lah
last time kan kita kena sit sec one alternate right boy and girl then boy girl or whatever right
so second row is lee ying tak salah third row is shika you know
oh she only join sec two I thought she sec one memang ada sec one ada lah ada ada ada ada
even steven and vengkat is taller than you tahu
eh malay class why mia banyak bual selalu dia jer bual
there's normal acad ada
wan nuryanti lah dia dulu dengan
so anyway if I'm not wrong she got she already have three ke four kids
then lepas tu I
I know she was in hospital ada gambar shot
then after that oh back home lah then ada gambar gambar court then I was like eh like you gave birth ah
no lah we um we just like will comment kalau ada like nice nice things like we just see tu
she's the next class what last time when we E diorang F ah
tak salah I don't know
but dulu in school never really talk ah
oh ah apa eh dia cakap err
on one ah then uh Facebook I usually read only baca-baca then lepas tu dia
they say oh dia cakap anak dia ada boy
doa bulan-bulan puasa nak ada baby boy
then I asked is it then the thing is I didn't know she was pregnant right if not I would have donated baju-baju tu to her right then I was like
so I was like kau ni ada lagi tak baju-baju baby then she like no more lah dah all dah get rid already
mm dia also macam moved also I think
ah but bukit panjang to bukit panjang tak salah
I think he sells better lah sebab dia ada banyak followers
not nice she already said to the one yang
she rent out the the rental punya agent
when the agent ada banyak contacts and banyak followers it's easier to sell lah
okay macam mana besok
besok is
actually sekarang so far
I mean being in army like a lot of things already sudah restricted so
naturally we all sudah tak boleh keluar tak boleh go see our friends and all that so weekdays all aku pun tak free then
you know follow so that you know sekarang tak tak dapat saman kan ya
oh ya now is like the limit is wait is it still five or sekarang sudah buat sepuluh orang is it
actually if I'm not wrong now kalau wedding kan then we can have up to fifty people right
oh so sekarang means ikut shift ah dia punya macam wedding or like
oh cause from what I know is like next week I have a jemputan
cause from what they told me is that now only I think about lima puluh
the table sudah nak kena be err separated
kat your instagram story right pasal err the new system
you get certain score and all that then doesn't make you eligible to masuk like
if you understand then you can explain a bit lah macam
err cause both of us are going off field and all that then kat dalam hutan
sudah lah tak ada signal tak ada handphone pula
tak akan nak check news kan I mean news is legitly the last thing on my mind
just give me the opportunity to jumpa new people to interact more with err
tak wasted lah ya I really get to use it to
kalau if you ask me personally whether I would
give back more to the masyarakat
right I mean aku masih muda lagi
then what are the things like uh kau guys kau buat
what's the activities yang kau suka buat like say on a weekend lah ya
maybe go to the beach pergi jogging ke
okay pergi makan
cause I I I think I agree with you with that cause the moment you masuk camp
I think that's the one oh when my mum masak you know
like what my family suka buat kalau on weekends right is that
we usually try to make sure cause weekends is err bila everyone is
my adik and my mum they're free
err walking or cycling lah just around the area cause I stay err dekat dengan apa tu east coast
so kalau nak pergi beach pun err tak jauh sangat
kalau hujan lebat then okay lah that's when
make it like seimbang you know err just have a balance
kalau weekends you think about it you only have dua puluh empat jam
timing yang kita ada is definitely limited
kalau anything about pun I'm not so afraid to just bilang dia orang ah
eh last time dulu aku papa pun buat ini buat ini like last
ah dulu kalau nak pergi keluar nak kena march and don't know what
wait I I was also enlisted in tekong so jadi
my family also ikut pergi sampai tekong and then they all
mum and dad adik and my eh my adik
and my nenek my err makcik
then we went to the cook house then check the food then of course lah kalau first day kan
they all need to set a good impression for all the parents so dia orang give the best food lah that they have
then ah I remember that day wah boleh nangis seh
ah rindu lah haven't been so
all nyanyi-nyanyi right all bising-bising
no ours was ours dua belas I think
macam total check my financial spending ah and really pen down pen and paper what
think about it err the duit that I
err set aside for macam macam transport kan
then after that kalau transport there and back cause I don't know selalu aku take grab lah
err careful with the where you spend the duit lah
start menjimatkan wang lah uh especially now that
beli mcdonald's beli what all that it's just like
no no no tomorrow lah at the start then can go out beli baju kan
now err sebab all got the macam mana nak cakap the elections kan
cause err kalau you look at it right now
some of them like kasihan juga lah you look at them then they're like if they end up
err just buang all their duit during cause they ya our seniors ah
all buang their duit during then because of that when they they don't have as much then
and really err how to say err jaga your own money
I think for me like what you asked just now right uh tadi you said
cause definitely I really don't want to bebankan my parents financially lah and most of the
kalau extend contract kan jadi sampai cause
the idea is that err kalau we stay longer kat dalam camp
tapi mm tak tak sedap sangat
I mean tak it's not that bad
like uh tak jadi beban to your parents ah
tapi now
okay tapi now I feel like ya let's just talk about makanan ah really that's like my favourite thing to talk about
no I mean it's like sometimes it's like eh you want to go eat it's a it's a it's a it's not I'm not necessarily lapar or anything
tapi it's just a excuse for me to like
err jumpa kawan jumpa family
err eratkan silaturahim lah with people people that
like you say asalkan halal I'm steady lah
a'ah eh kampung food aiya nevermind lah bro
apa kalau kau beli rendang right it's like what one piece it's already like I I also don't know ah I think it's like three dollars at least
then worst is sotong
so you you buy sotong that time
bulan puasa then my family pergi geylang kan nak makan
nak okay not makan sorry nak beli untuk buka lauk ah
standard ah you'll pack away take away lauk right
call that err sotong right the
sotong hitam sotong hitam that was the big squid then it was like what
in my opinion ya sebab kalau lapar kan a quick fix
ya then sebab it's convenient
err stand in one row right then semua beli maggi then tambah telur
then the telur selalu macam tak masak apa the aunty will say eh setengah masak but it's like
obviously not cooked then we just kacau everything then makan terus
encik tan encik tan bro that's like the go to nasi
then after that it naik sampai berapa eh
sampai tujuh puluh lapan bro
there is no way right kau boleh belajar and study at the same time
ya is ya oh sorry makan dan belajar at the same time sorry
so jadi we had to make do with what we had then
usually kita beli what err just nasi campur
or the india punya makanan ah
what we had was what err nasi padang right
nasi padang and the asagani stall
oh do you remember when err dulu
when we used to beli the nasi goreng first right then we just ask eh ada nasi kway
cik ada nasi goreng ada kway teow goreng then she'll be like
eh ada ada okay okay err jangan bilang orang then we
suddenly it's like everyone knew what nasi goreng was
honestly it was I think it was a different type of nasi goreng I I don't haven't tried it outside yet
there's no nasi goreng that I've tried that does like that it's super spicy
hey it was a super spicy nasi goreng
bulan puasa bro
okay bukannya susah sangat
betul betul okay understand
I try to masak lah sometimes cause when I'm at home
especially when I got oh actually I won't say it's masak but I try to bake when I have the time to
ya some things I did was eh that time remember bulan puasa
I made err err suji for everyone
because tak boleh agak how much err ramuan you need right
and all the sukatan-sukatan all that was very obscure to me
and some are online recipe ya first time buat then they say eh
ya ya that's true that's that's very tiny tiny suji right
then sudah sudah sudah habis buat then dia punya what you call that
when I made the err the whole aduan right it was a bit
so when I tried to make kuih for the first time that's what happened ah then the suji came out
I stay in the east area then this amshar pula tinggal kat
apa woodlands kan jauh gila so obviously
nak naik train pun I took like one and the half hours so
wah memang but that day sempat lah
sempat sempat balik bedok by buka seh
cause I left quite late I remember oh then I stopped by ang mo kio I wanted to meet tok mat to pass him the suji then he gave me another whole
um what you call that a whole container of kuih tart in return so
what was it ah it was oh hari raya oh I was I had leave
ya is no bro is the eve of raya bro
eh tak boleh ah I got interview then I was like oh okay lah then I go to your house ah
nasib baik I remember where you stay sia
actually this kind of thing also honestly I a bit kekok but but why did the the baking thing was that
suji for myself it's just dah
tak masuk akal lah for me to eat everything oh what
ya for everything on my own obviously I eat one or two sudah a bit muak sikit kan
let's say kalau I'm outside kan then I see people macam
need help especially older people naik naik bus that kind of thing then angkat the bag all like go inside right
paiseh kan because if you think about it eh ah memandai jer nak tolong
then err obviously she understands that aku pun nak she understands that aku pun nak tolong dia kan
kalau the makanan kan is halal right it will be less
but then err aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang right
ya ambil hati also then they also tak nak
eh actually I feel bad macam I I don't I
ah kari asam pedas bro that that nestle ice cream container got asam pedas
but tapi kalau you
ya but then err the my other halal option is uh mamak lah
mamak stall lah bro supper club
ah infomercials that's why there's kalau kau tengok jamaah kan one suria and all that
so obvious eh like eh ah abang
err susu biasa lah tak payah pakai
ha ha I think I see this most often about my nenek lah
ya they they I mean in general my nenek cooks everyday
for for starters my nenek is quite open to all this also
kan ada tetamu datang obviously you have to prepare something right for them
but because we sudah bawa makan
ya tak payah susah sangat
you know we used to beli ah sweet talk semua kat bawah block kan
ya only if you use like special discount ke
okay kalau sudah ada kahwin okay sudah kahwin pun boleh lah
ya masak tak akan hari-hari nak masak maggi
I saw your posting bro not bad ah kau dengan kau punya baju suit semua very classy eh not bad eh
berapa lama kau kerja sana ah
ye ke tapi aku dengar dorang cakap saudi arabia is a very corrupted country tau
cause ya I saw a lot of news right especially the the prince kan the prince sulaiman he a lot of controversies about him and then you know now his his other neighbouring countries the arab countries ah have a lot of war and then his ties with the america nya
arab countries but anyway I mean I think this is too much of a politic abeh kau bila kau kat saudi arabia selain solat kau buat apa sana
oh so if you were given another chance kau will travel saudi arabia or would you like to try negeri lain
so speaking of football kan abeh orang-orang main bola ni semua dorang masih main ke dorang pun dah stop macam kita orang juga
ah negara luar macam messi ronaldo ni semua kan dorang masih main ke or they have to you know take a pause from this cause of the COVID pandemic
tapi sementara jer bro cause ah
kalau kau tengok betul-betul eh sekarang kau tengok electric punya tariff dah naik nine point three per cent abeh so I think the government will first
for for them lah but I mean we have no choice we have to make do of what we can abeh sekarang ni kau kerja apa ninja van eh
oh savings eh tapi slowly your savings will also
jadi kurang kan abeh kau tak worry ah
tak bro that one was just uh interview that I went to went for
um not bad lah you know I think there's more opportunities in the healthcare industry so why not aku just try to continue so for now aku just uh aku kerja as a clinic assistant ah
which is quite tough ah banyak patients and
you know banyak demands
the protected gear ah eh and then uh quite safe ah kau kau kalau ikut all the safety protocols ah everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved ah I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since aku tak pernah ambil semua seh so aku maybe ah my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
mm kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun there's a lot of a
uh and it's been a growing trend ah I see a lot of uh races actually uh branching into this line cause selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja grab food pun ye lah orang-orang kita kan betul tak
tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja at least gaji aku eh aku at least rasa kena at least two point five and above ah itu pun depends kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja normal is quite risky ah kalau kau kerja macam
err gaji yang one K plus jer unless if you only living with your wife
mm that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays ah you know our generations especially tapi if you were to think about it
know the traditions tu yang susah tu the culture of our our race kan kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves abeh macam mana seh nak sustain kalau ada anak semua kan nak kena bayar bill
bayar susu diapers semua I mean of course definitely they they you know dapat baby bonus ni semua tapi berapa lama seh boleh tahan
tak boleh tahan kan aku rasa
ya but singapore pun
I mean kau kena faham-faham ah singapore dorang akan kasi kau grants for free nya apa
err like sekarang kau tengok dorang dah increase traffic eh electricity nya price nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik so but I mean the government they are doing their best lah I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country kan to remain at the top
abeh no choice ah
government I think government will try their best lah but we we still have to find ways ah no matter what aku rasa
kita kena hustle ah this is a hustling years lah just like macam dulu ah time SARS zaman SARS dulu pun dorang
economy pun jatuh tapi kau tengok slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves ah we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it ah orang cakap
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing dah berapa jer
tapi personally aku tak tahu ah aku rasa
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body ah mentally physically aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak exercise tak you know take their time to you know relax to ease off kalau tak
kau pun boleh terjejas ah kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk ah
macam lagi ramai orang I mean dorang dorang memang susah pe so I think macam aku nak cakap dorang dah get used to it lah abeh tapi I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
uh wealthily macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini kan then dorang macam terus jadi stress sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini kan
dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah so dorang might know what to do or might hustle even like normally ah they do like hustle really hard tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja
high position semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh survive kan gini so that's why dorang stress kan
and then we have to fight through ah and speaking of which kan berbual pasal COVID aku recently baca news trump kena COVID is it true
aku tengok ah siol tapi the thing is kenapa china buat macam gini eh I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions macam I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
apa ni world
organisations eh yang the one with apa united nations is it
dorang pun are against it tau abeh aku tak faham kenapa they are still doing this eh but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care ah aku just buat ni tak ada orang boleh stop aku
so even though aku might say that I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china kan aku might side with trump ah just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims kan
then aku rasa it's it's it's really cruel ah but I don't know why kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini eh
which are aku rasa it's just too much ah to be honest this is just like macam zaman-zaman dulu seh if kalau kau belajar history kat secondary school semua kan kalau kau belajar kau tengok ah hitler kau tengok macam orang macam um stalin of what they have done
so it's aku rasa it's just it's just effed up ah aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak ah aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman serious
sebab setahu aku eh
the black err civil rights activist ni semua they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people macam
aku rasa tak tahu eh macam
that's what I heard also ah macam apa ni dia ada counterfeit nya duit kan
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police dekat america is being
ah so kalau aku rasa kalau kau as an american kan kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu ah macam mana
aku tak aku tak imagine kalau this situation were to happen in singapore
kita sikit jer dah riot dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu country
apa lagi kalau legit kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau witness kita nya own singapore police buat gini confirm kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap
ah aku rasa
I think it memang exist ah aku rasa the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism ah it it will happen in all countries in all places and aku rasa that's why the government
tapi nak buat macam mana kalau government tak tekun dengan dia punya laws semua kan tak tak really ah
be serious about this then aku rasa kita nya country
will be like other countries ah I mean let's just look at our neighbour ah malaysia kau tahu malaysia sendiri kalau
okay aku sendiri melayu kan aku tak nak cakap
tapi aku rasa the malay rights over there it's
it's belittling the other races ah tak tahu ah aku rasa dari malaysia
so kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata kan aku cina eh abeh aku nak beli rumah aku malaysia citizen tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar extra mahal sebab aku cina
eh a'ah betul juga eh
macam dorang tak bersyukur eh macam apa dorang dapat
that's what aku personally see lah or feel bila aku when aku tengok kat news
err videos on the internet what what kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak
and it's sad to see ah tapi aku tak faham ah kenapa najib dia dia dah kena tangkap kan aku dengar dia dapat confirm he's dia dah found guilty kan
it's just so chaotic macam tak ada orang control seh macam those pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah parliament lain
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what aku tak faham ah macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa seh macam
boleh dorang ada orang macam gini to represent eh
mm aku pun nampak ni dekat facebook or youtube ah
but ah I think it's on twitter tapi how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
but aku aku really wonder how
ah recruitment and the position that is of power ah macam ni semua position important important seh abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh just get away with all these things
if you were given a choice eh kau will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
the money money wise I think what I would do aku would probably kerja kat singapore
tapi um
tapi aku would live there so aku can know have a lot of make a lot of more money ah abeh aku boleh spend
ah tu eh that's true eh aku rasa I mean
tapi if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position ah which you have to climb eventually
aku rasa it's all about
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever tapi
ah currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can uh I think it's more important for me to focus on myself ah sia I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend abeh aku tak boleh sustain mata air aku
then teruk ah puas hati aku ada banyak duit then aku boleh ada girlfriend then aku boleh you know
kita dua-dua boleh enjoy
tapi ya lah
then what kau kau ada mata air
know we we may not kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga
people who are happily in the relationship together they dorang macam relax jer tak post apa-apa just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily ah
to tengok orang macam gini semua kan I think ada segelintir ah mungkin dorang macam rasa the same thing tapi
ada juga ah golongan yang you know uh having good relationships ah so aku rasa kau should give a try tapi ye lah likewise you know aku rasa sekarang tengah susah kan so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself ah
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever tapi
for my race but entah aku rasa macam
tak boleh ah kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap
you know tunjuk yang kita boleh lead anak orang betul tak
tapi no choice ah this is how
we uh most parents are dealing with their child cause kita pun nak kena survive pe nak cari duit it's all about money ah singapore is all about being financially stable ah and that sacrifice have to be made ah kalau kau nak
so aku rasa that's why some cultures they
abeh uh
abeh macam uh
dah terpaksa ah aku rasa it's dah macam
dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita ah sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah so
that's why aku rasa financial planning is very important kita kena plan sekarang before having a kid you know not just funfair buat lepas tu at last kita susah then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu
and to have a beautiful family ah tu aku rasa ah um yup
on your end kau rasa apa
boleh ah you know got this uh oh god
finally dah holiday sikit ah so boleh lepak at home and uh
just main computer lepak keluar dengan family ya
macam gitu jer ah you never you never do anything interesting you know like

ya kalau beli phone baru pun is better I feel like beli phone can buy camera apa camera yang good quality
that's why I also like planning to buy new phone juga with a good quality camera on the phone which I do not know tapi I kena find out lah
oh oh it got contract or just the phone itself oh oh I dengan contract I ada contract
no what I want to err what err err a a phone with camera sebab kan I cakap I ada facebook live kan
so I can take pictures of my clothes take good quality I mean sekarang I can use my phone to take good quality ah but it's not good quality it is just a picture which is nice but it's not a good quality picture
okay but my one I have no problem sekarang sebab I have microphone I have microphone
what sekarang my camera quality for me macam tak apa uh not bad okay cuma kena ada good wi-fi
connection if wi-fi connection is not good dia akan
so that's why sometime you see my video will be like macam err a bit not good quality sebab wi-fi connection wi-fi connection is important
like that is apa kena pakai wi-fi connection more daripada mobile data kalau mobile data bila pakai dia lagi rabak dia punya lagging
benda-benda yang I tak tahu I pun tengok youtube juga ya so macam ya because so come back to youtube juga of course tapi macam mana eh you nak jual baju dekat youtube
tapi I nak phone baru mainly sebab I nak ambil gambar of this baju yang I ada okay I'm not concerned about

you talking to someone yang belajar photoshop so why you saying that guy that way
yang mop canteen mop canteen
you know what reminds me of my sekolah time sunrise sunrise sunrise kan a'ah sunrise
is a kitchen so you have to clean up our clean up is like thorough clean up as well um sapu
lepas tu mop lepas tu cuci all the pan pots all wash
no flour on it make sure there's no dust or flour it just like okay and then jap when you cakap macam gitu teringat macam oh okay macam sama kat sekolah aku pun sama bikin gitu
know the rubbish bin all that right err so kita again ah upper aside those ya not so basically we will most of the time we will ask like
um everyday we have our own leader you know everyday we have you know like if if if apa ni primary school ke secondary school prefect prefect secondary school
eh secondary pun ada eh
so like prefect kan macam everyday kita ada prefect dekat sekolah tu walaupun it's already a a
ikut dia punya register number something like that so it's not loser basically this person do right is like everyday dia akan assign like
okay the four of you will do the pots and pans the four of you will mop the four of you will do this ataupun okay the four of you will collect the ingredients the flour and put on top okay the four of you
there's a term for that we don't call monitor or president other term other term I lupa apa chef entah apa chef I lupa but I hate it when it comes to my turn
no I'm not I'm the most macam no um the most shy because like in the morning I have to be talking to all of them like as if like I'm the leader sia I have to talk like okay I'm the leader you guys have to listen to me I'm not that kind of person what I'm not
so macam bila part I jer macam macam mana ah macam mana ah everytime is my turn I will be like ah shit I'm so scared I'm so scared I will get like anxiety macam
panic uh macam mana macam mana but the hal is everytime dah dapat tau everytime dah dapat because it rotates what
even if I don't want to lead then I'll be like macam on lah very on very kiasu you know
tapi kan macam ini macam tak ada pilihan langsung everyday orang rotate orang yang ada yang lagi pemalu daripada I
yang very shy super timid ada that one also like
but that we as a as the dia punya classmate tak ada macam
wah this one wah rabak sia cannot sia cannot sia we don't kita akan macam
for for example lah nama dia michelle eh michelle we would encourage her would be macam michelle it's okay you tell me what you want me to do you tell me I sitting beside you you tell me
ya time sekolah that's why I really love at sunrise you know at sunrise it's like the most amazing school I mean okay maybe the school is not really amazing tapi I punya classmate is the most amazing classmate ever so I macam happy gila
time secondary school primary school jangan cakap lah paling merepek

ya kak
ya kak
tak ada no I looking
hello mas apa khabar
it's okay macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana mm so what are your plans for this weekend
oh yes ahmad is there uh dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada uh think four or five kids
no lah it's okay ah rezeki masing-masing ah so are you not going out with your family today
like kesian kan
bagus lah tu boleh jaga anak-anak
bagus seh masak untuk husband all
ya but ni adalah satu uh precaution for us to take ya so kita perlu berhati-hati lah
so penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah jer
ya lah stress lah at work macam-macam
since it's the holidays kan banyak orang-orang datang uh visit museum
so kalau you nak datang dengan family nak kena datang on weekdays
uh weekend tak boleh lah pasal terlalu ramai
uh until nak queue under the hot sun pengsan pula
um tak ada lah semua kena queue macam biasa
ya so ya lah kind of sad pasal tengah holiday sekarang but we have nowhere to go
oh ya ya I've read about it but belum ada time lah to redeem tour voucher
oh I don't think ada
for kids ada tu vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
online ah so it's not that bad lah hundred dollars pun jadi lah kan
biasa lah singaporean bila yang dia orang tak complain
mm understand ya I think uh COVID nineteen ni menjejas banyak singaporean
then ya lah kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah ah nak pergi holiday pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu lah
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so pasal I think malaysia pun sekarang masih ada banyak case ah so it's still unstable lah
I think uh ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also ada bilang juga
ah no lah I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask pun can do its job lah
ya lah sekarang pun yang baru-baru case dekat tampines mall tu wah
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall terperanjat seh
uh so far tak ada pula case yang lain-lain
I mean yang in the community lah
ah because you will never know seh who yang ada penyakit ni then kita pun senang jangkit especially dengan macam
warga emas dengan kita punya parents nak kena jaga-jaga
ya I think baru semalam news uh that people are queuing over at mana eh
in place ah tapi kan from the look of the photos tak ada jer think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
ya lah that's where the christmas light up is lagi so this year has been a challenging year lah ah
ada bagus juga lah that you
tak ni lah but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to ke malaysia ke I think it's affecting business everywhere uh kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian kan
I think mm mana-mana affected
mm ya lah but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business ah cuma are required to have the mandatory swab test then uh like
tak payah lah so I I dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena swab test yang
uh kalau
kalau dibuat dengan betul tak lah rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru or trainee yang buat wah rasa lah pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali
ya I think I even my friend yang
ya actually quite kesian ah in this situation macam banyak orang ada family but
kena berhenti kerja business tutup
twenty twenty has been uh ya lah like I said a challenge lah untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan lah
measure steps ah I think which is quite good lah for all lah even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted tak boleh keluar ke apa but still it's for our own good lah
oh I do actually err I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like ah so he and his wife dah beli
ya but I don't know how berapa bagus yang reusable punya mask
tak lah because uh
bulan december err think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe nak ajak makan lah but
wah only can keluar um five lima orang sahaja
think kalau the atmosphere is different lah when you dining outside err dengan makan kat rumah kan
take care of ourselves lah think the celebration is is actually pasal kita nak kena
mm mana kita berhenti tadi
um ah awak
seorang baker awak suka masak apa
untuk family
pandai juga awak baking eh abeh kalau masak masak apa
oh untuk lah eh suami awak family awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal COVID ni
mm mungkin pasal orang dah stock up ke uh iya lah singaporean kan macam saya cakap kiasu dia orang suka benar simpan
oh beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi uh three or four packets for a family of
ya lah kesian yang orang-orang yang ya lah tak ada pendapatan mm tapi saya rasa ada juga restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
mm ya lah saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah lah mana dia orang pergi
mm betul tu uh there's a lot of platform yang go digital so I think uh everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop ah these are now necessities
ya I think uh a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can lah so it's best they do so lah during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected seh ya I think my friends either yang kena retrenched at an early age eh
ya kesian kan
I think dia tak akan take the swabber paying job lah pasal I think he has more kids at home kesian takut he'll be affected lah even though he'll be uh think
he has his reasons lah for not doing that kind even though it's uh gaji tinggi but still dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan uh
ya where should we go to makan what is your favourite food
yes the curry is uh sedap
ah ada yang baik tu boleh juga pakai app sekarang kan semua
wah see sekarang semua dah high tech
order makan pun boleh
ya at this point memang ah it's not
not right to be walking on their own tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah terexpose dengan COVID ni I think it will take masa yang panjang untuk dia orang to recover to get well ah kesian I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic kan macam I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya kesian kan
mm betul tu abeh lagi cause my parents are staying on their own kesian kan we don't get to meet them as much abeh ada some old folks tak tahu pakai smartphone so lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu so kesian dia orang so masa-masa gini lah kita patut berwaspada even though it's sad but we have to follow lah
ya lah yang generasi yang
lama mereka tak terexpose dengan internet macam kita sekarang so with this technology I think dia orang will
ah ambil masa untuk
so kesian so
macam makin kurang and there's less interaction human interaction
ya lah tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia and dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh
mm actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones lah yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya lah nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa lah
that's why it's uh important lah to untuk mereka um update dengan keep with the trend apa yang berlaku bukan jadi trendy lah cuma keep up with the times
mungkin juga lah tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga so mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat
um balik semula kehidupan yang normal
some dan hari raya
mm uh macam
kirakan contact is now minimal lah mm
sedih lah tapi macam mana
mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan lah setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya
iya lah pasal singaporean usually kalau holiday akan go overseas uh mm holiday uh tapi sekarang tengah
tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di singapore
oh bagus tu idea staycation
boleh juga awak dan family destress
mm okay lah ya lah macam saya cakap ini adalah
the new normal yang kita akan lalui tak tahu berapa lama lagi
harap bersabar sahaja lah kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua
oh itu safe distance ambassador
ah dia orang akan memerhatikan
okay lah ada yang volunteer ada yang dibayar gaji ni part of the
government agency yang united mm
mm tu lah saya pun perasan juga
tak lah mungkin mereka
berjalan-jalan untuk mencari orang yang melanggari peraturan lah tapi saya tak rasa dia orang boleh mengangkap dia orang boleh menasihat
uh dengar kata dan tak lawan peraturan-peraturan mm
oh tu mungkin dia orang volunteer daripada lain lain agency mungkin yang tak ada uniform tu mungkin
dalam bekerja lah untuk united
mm agaknya pakcik tu
uh tu dia orang tu dah nak hantar boleh lah
dah diam lah okay

I don't know ah that's the plan ah I follow only cause I think the the whole idea of song by song is like at least you know scared like kita release macam all one shot kan nanti macam people get bored easily ah like ah so kita punya style gitu ah I mean is four songs only apa it's not it's not like a whole album lah if whole album then
what what's the whole concept ah you know what I mean the whole concept of the is macam is all err is is interconnected ah is like err is like err macam a story ah from song number one to song number four
ah yes concept album so semua macam interconnected ah there's a story to it ah
so kita plan macam release song by song right then every song ada different artwork
budget ah see what kind of concept lah then also must pay for mastering err then we use up some money also for for our recording and all so but then we'll see ah we'll see how it goes ah pelan-pelan ah pelan-pelan kayuh ah
tapi dia still macam part of it pe part of us dia tak keluar like know tak keluar in a bad terms dia keluar in a good term
and then you know he he was also part of the whole recording journey in the beginning pe ya so then tak kesah ah then we will we'll see how ah kita nanti duduk berbual we discuss with everyone see if they okay with it
entah tengah rabak juga ah
pasal dia was working dekat mana eh
dia was working dekat
then lepas tu err circuit breaker dia kena laid off just like that
baru masuk orh baru masuk like I think one month plus two months ah
then kena laid off so dia struggle ah but I think he's doing graphic design and also food delivery ah but okay eh the food delivery actually actually cannot help cannot help ah
so not bad ah I mean simple don't want to make it over very overly mix if not like rabak sia like like overly produced
duh rabak rabak rabak rabak rabak that one rabak but okay lah we see lah
tu lah
tapi aku rasa kalau touring kan confirm tak so soon punya confirm lama lagi seh
aku tahu aku tahu aku tahu pasal siti nak kahwin
tu ah abeh macam mana kacau mesti kacau punya abeh macam mana orang nak kahwin
tapi kau dah set seh
aku rasa dia masih cakap the the only girl in the family
tapi depends ah individual pe tapi tak tahu ah tak tahu tak tahu apa pasal lah eh but maybe sekarang memang period dia nak tak tahu aku tak tahu maybe dorang buat grand ke tapi
ya but entah lah eh
I think he doesn't show ah he doesn't show that he needs to struggle lah but but before that dia he was okay what when he he haven't got he was going to get married I I
oh ya lah beli rumah cause rumah expensive but then got pe
ya aku tak tahu tapi
but then again both kerja full-time pe full-time should be able to sustain apa macam kalau you say you like freelancer okay ah of course ah that one jialat but but full-time confirm every month you will get
tapi pun depends ah if how big of a house you want to buy ah I mean if you technically if you one time you want to buy one big house of course it's quite expensive lah but if you start small anyway houses you can sell what you know some people will start small buy three room first ah
if not ah if us ah walao confirm confirm huru-hara one macam apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni
nanti aku depressed dengan duit orang dengan aku sendiri stress seh eh macam mana ni
tapi tu rabak juga sia kalau dia cabut
tapi estee power ah estee pandai manage ah
but entah lah
tapi okay lah band band aku missy shoot pun
missy shoot pun nak record lah so tapi kita take it easy pasal sekarang I mean hakim is busy with work rabak gila aku macam dah beberapa minggu sia tak jumpa dia ajak lepak tak jumpa ajak lepak tak jumpa
dia jam dekat sini tapi dia actually tak reply message
bila dorang book
dia tengah busy
dia so dorang tak ada dia dorang message dia tengah busy dia tak dia tak dia tak dia tak reply pasal tengah busy kan so dia belum cakap dia okay ke tak then suddenly they book
they book already ah dorang dah book huh serious ah dorang dah book semalam aku tak reply sia
then dia turun ah tu pasal aku rasa dia lambat cause dia kena settle family benda punya pe I mean he work also busy already then he needs to spend time with family so bo pian ah
ya tapi okay lah but missy shoot pasal kita selalu jam also on weekdays jadi dia pun tengah busy tapi kita tengok lah but definitely the plan is to record at least by
hujung tahun ni ah
tak tahu ah
I think sial is very influential macam banyak influence err orang-orang probably also cause of
dia female fronted
abeh and then nyanyi malay lagu melayu
then very very strong musical apa
bagus juga rare juga nampak band macam gitu like playing macam
betul aku realise that juga
I mean aku ikut korang yang time europe tour aku realise actually aku get to see many things
but then again I think the twenty four hours pun macam can feel the vibe lah pasal you are still macam dekat another country orh then you see like even though macam say for example eh for example kau main germany ah but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different ah
so at least you get to see that culture know macam berlin really very
power and hipster hipster-ish very ni and then you go to another part of germany is like very more rundown ghetto sucky very kampung like in kampung ah but then
macam save cost ah kau tak payah spend duit on macam err apa lodging dorang will kasi kau crash tempat dorang I mean that's the give and take ah you know
I mean I think dia maybe that his style ah if he don't like that culture or not say culture ah he don't like the vibe of the place I think he don't want to go lah
ah same same as long as I get out of here like singapore for at least that whole stretch two weeks ah two weeks pun dah cukup
cause kalau tak rabak sia kau
cause aku realise siti is is quite an adventurous person looking at her travel photos like when she posts on her social apa instagram
she can travel alone dia boleh travel alone pergi macam
ah tu pasal ah
gila cause aku realise cause bila that time kita dekat london tu then dia willing to go jalan-jalan sorang dia pandai explore seh like like she knows her way ah like to to just explore ah dia tak takut she got she's fearless ah but I think
that something yang holding her back ah
ya but tak tahu ah
aku pun nak tour lah dengan macam urgent matter I mean missy shoot lain sikit lah pasal kalau nak tour
probably lagi susah lah pasal lal pun macam iman's league right and then it's very
it'll be hard lah I mean cause missy shoot broke up for quite a while then I think the focus for him was iman's league ah then he came back so but I think he he still very on lah he wrote songs for missy shoot like even like you know when he do chords then he will ask eh does this ni kena tak
then macam tak ah ni tak kena ah ni very very iman's league ah okay tak apa then dia akan tukar to change to kita punya vibe
selalunya is dol or most of the time is dol lah
he he he did give some ideas err when we take in some ideas some ideas macam tak kena lah pasal it's not our vibes but he tries to control not to go into macam very rubik's vibes
you know ah dia macam
err but he will try to control he he don't want to macam dia tak nak tukar the sounds
ah bad religion I mean influence ah cause we influence with bad religion abeh macam influence with rise against dol punya influence is heavily rise against
heavy lal is very melodic guy lal suka melody so he
japanese punk like cause he grow up with macam he grow up with a lot of ska music and then japanese ska japanese punk rock he he he dia banyak macam on that vibe but aku is more very bad religion penny wise ah
ah propagandhi err that fast and know a lot of yes so that that vibe so at least it's but bagusnya everything is jumble up you see so semua dah jumble up semua dah macam
biasa ah
but entah eh
dia macam very err straight kan
tapi dorang tak tahu ah zul dah tak cakap dengan ni ah dengan bob ah eh practise ah single pedal aku feel playing single pedal
yang buat dia very unique ah dia macam unique gila ah but then ah to each its own ah style ah ya but see ah see ah I don't know ah we still got a
betul dorang dah boring ah
bad religion still stick to that sound but then ada modern element I feel ah that's how I feel
he got a vibe ah a different vibe I still like bad religion ah cause dorang
cause they very abang abang
I don't know ah he some pop punkers like feeling feeling tapi macam
entah very kental ah I cannot this pop punk pop punk thing ah
tapi tengah set ah
then will send us then cakap okay err ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit
err then he will adjust okay okay let's meet then bila time jumpa baru like minor tweaking and tweak as much as possible
then dah lah see how pasal kita record with no clicks then very simple err
miking macam drums only four mikes err so that's why some sound macam really tak boleh dapat and stuff lah but we this is like a trial ah for me lah it's a trial ah but then nanti tengok ah like in future future recording kita do it like better ah
cause hakim macam dah offer eh next recording aku aku will make sure like all the all the miking will be better lah
ya lah that's why dia dia discovered tu pasal that time actually dia offered to macam eh macam kau nak rerecord balik kau punya drum but then
ah but then aku cakap eh tak ada click orh we don't play with click so it's gonna be susah sia like okay lah we try ah I did record like what um we tried half a song ah but it's difficult cause there's no click
tak feel ah like tak feel ah so then I think then I told him next time ah like the next time we we we try to record
cause he discover but good thing that but good ah he's very hardworking dia discover sounds so he he knows more stuff so next time round he can give more input lah but then again it's not a bad recording ah this time
correct but then have to be patient ah but then but then again for example this spacedays punya
spacedays punya vibe is because we we needed to
big one the big one tall one ah bass man fender bass man I think he bought for like what seven hundred plus then he he refurbish balik err for like four hundred plus so he actually spent like thousand plus on that cheap
dia rajin gila ah ya but good lah know he he he he invests on that lah he invests on that then to have like
then apa tu force vomit pun tengah record
ah then recently dia cakap last week eh last week dia cakap dia record dikir barat
don't know I think cause he knows some guys you know he he also got this ranggi ranggi guys ah ranggi is the motorcycle macam
ah so ranggi is actually macam um
ranggi is err some of them ada budak-budak dikir barat ah
so I think dorang
abeh hakim is a buat sounds pe
so dia macam pergi dekat dia lah but then banyak lah then it's like side bazaar bush man dia punya side project
adib I think adib playing bass err then got err um restam bushman main guitar then err rizal rizal dulu main sound of province rizal main sound of province dulu
rizal kecil
he covered ah session I think for sound province but he's a good drummer lah then dia main for this band aku tak tahu siapa lagi a few more guys ah like play for his band
so dorang macam rerecord balik ah ya
um but then financially maybe tak sangat lah
tu lah
tu pasal lah tak aku cakap dengan zad juga zad dia tahu macam dia tak ada benda abeh then tiba-tiba macam korang main semua cakap zad kau nak pakai pakai ah kau nak pakai pakai ah eh tak boleh ah kau mahal sangat macam tak kesah ah pakai jer it's a wear and tear thing
aku tahu dia mahal but then I'm giving you that that green light apa that green light to just go and use instead of
but okay ah understand sometimes people don't want to terhutang budi kau tahu
tak maybe maybe also from experience
like we don't know like maybe dulu dia pernah macam have this friend who like okay just use ah then after that after using already then like eh wah now I want to you never give me back macam you know
jialat ah jialat got friend ah but then tak tahu ah but I'm okay ah kalau zad nak pinjam
dah ah
tapi end of the day also all the stuff macam like it's a wear and tear punya benda pe so
tak boleh cakap kalau kau pakai tak pecah esok aku pakai pecah eh you also broken what it'll also break what like know like so it's okay lah I mean the thing is
ya that's why kesian sia I know he's been macam dia berbual dengan aku ah like cannot wait sia I cannot wait to play drums sia
ah I cannot wait to lepak I cannot wait to record you know I told him lah if you need to record a band say for example band want to record you just record then call some of us lah we can help you set up the mic setting ah
like I know he don't want to terhutang budi that's confirm and maybe his style is different dia takut macam dia
maybe he accidentally say for example we set the mic he scared he accidentally scold eh macam don't like that then he scared people like heart hurt what hurt the feeling hurt what so I don't think he's like that
but kita dah cakap ah I mean I already told him also eh kalau kau need to record you need help you just call us lah ah we will we will not ask for anything we will just help you ah cause you is is is you are the one doing the work
we here just to help lepak
sekarang mesti dia rabak gila seh dekat rumah tapi tengok ah
no but the thing is this type of thing right the walk right you cannot pikiran you know just go regret lepas tu ah regret after that ah but there's no regret ah I mean for me personally when I went err the walk was was rabak ah the starting was fun cause everything but
no but she also was struggling ah cause the last I think there was like four hundred metres we already saw the the entrance for coney island right that last four hundred metres suddenly like eh guys guys sekejap sekejap sekejap stop stop stop aku tak boleh aku tak boleh ah so we actually sat down and azil macam okay no problem no problem duduk
then it was like matahari dekat mata the sun was already like in the eyes ya
ya eight o'clock then kita macam eh kita rest like it was only like still it was also four hundred metres five hundred metres more can see already it's like the bridge was just in front of us then we took out our shoes then we lek sekejap lek sekejap
rabak ah for me ah personally but I told them sorry ah I say paiseh paiseh ah like we have to have a lot of stops
so you you still go but we take it slow never mind don't care about the time but as long as we reach there we settle ah ah so we did manage to finish ah so the moment we touch that thing right kita cakap kita sampai right
macam macam azil we made it ah we just high five sia
eh take photo take photo take photo lepas tu kita pergi tepi pengsan I lie down already sia I lie down already I don't care already take out shoes take out socks azil take out socks take out shoes aisyah also sit down then all termenung already like good twenty minutes
eh hafiz fetching ah jalan to the punggol settlement there is like another one click ah
one point five click ah betul
rabak ah
I I almost got into like hallucination already cause it's tiring already ah like oh dah penat ah dah penat ah dah penat ah mata dah rabak I cannot think properly then like want to smoke also malas you know like want to minum air just drink water ah drink water drink water drink water drink water
they even reach they want to eat also lazy you know so the moment we reach right actually hamimah zafran all they wake already they wanted to go makan
ya lah breakfast but cause aisyah ah hafiz fetching aisyah mah so they wanted to go makan then they ask you and nazril kau dengan nazril plan ah nak pergi makan mana then kita jumpa somewhere tu aku cakap eh tak boleh ah
kita nak balik tidur balik tidur ah nak balik tidur
so hafiz fetch us fetch actually wanted to fetch fetch aisyah then we wanted to grab home then hafiz cakap eh tak apa ah aku hantar korang ah
dia cakap semua orang dia dah rabak aku pergi cari toilet aku jalan balik dorang dah ketawa ketawa pasal aku dah slow gila then aku duduk aku duduk macam eh sia ah to go into the car also macam eh sia ah rabak sia ni
ah apa oh ya ya cause coastal
twenty one eh like like almost twenty clicks ah actually almost twenty clicks ya include east coast one way err hud told me is about twenty five clicks ye
tak but I think this time if we go right we we go that route but we
that sengkang we thought you is after that bridge thought the sengkang is already punggol sekali eh bukan it's another sengkang
but then the coney island right is if you go straight the park connector dia macam sampai dekat red bridge tau but this one is before red bridge kau dah belok kiri
mm tengok yang last sekali
mm nasi ayam
sustenance wise memang boleh lah tapi kalau fikir sangat pasal
the taste I think can be very boring cepat muak as well
hmm I don't really like mee kuning
boleh lah
peliknya ah do
and I tak faham dia cakap pasal apa
steamboat macam dekat
ada wire
itu lah kalau lama-lama nanti sesak hidung mm
mm ya good first time lah tak pernah try mala
tetapi kan
pun boleh kata macam muak juga lah
tak boleh lama-lama sangat lah makan
tetapi ini sedap lah
rasa sikit-sikit kan
ya so kalau private they
dah bagi timing lah nak datang hari apa and at what time
oh macam acid reflux ah
I kena malam itu just berapa like a few nights ago ugh
lepas itu nak kena bangun pagi untuk kelas like pukul lapan or
mm nak
tetapi kan takkan setakat nak beli satu sahaja tempat
so macam child best situation ah
err I think season four baru nak masuk
dia buat makeup dia macam itu ke
but I feel macam
I mean memang ah it's a show but it's too overplayed
macam terlalu drama lah
I know dan is jadi gossip girl tetapi macam tak make sense eh story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
mm sebab boleh nampak mm
dia macam he in one scene dia pun terjekut he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so dia texting diri dia sendiri lah kan
tetapi kan kalau
kalau theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl boleh masuk akal
ya or macam
ya and the fact that dia dapat marry serena pun macam err
serena and then he talk trash about her dekat gossip girl
mm raccoon lah bapa dia pun sama jer
tetapi wait dia punya part
part rambut itu
no lah dia punya hairstyle dia kadang-kadang macam tak match
eh dia dalam cerita star trek
oh bukan eh
uh siapa baru give birth tak eh
oh bukan bukan dah lama dah
apa seh
I mean I'm saving up all the cerita for after exams
mm tengah belajar
so nak kena make sure lah
kena make sure betul-betul nak yes
macam interesting jer
psychology is something you can take on tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa
time duit and betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja
uh well selalunya orang cakap two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
but tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil
ada duit ada time tapi kalau tak ada dedication macam buang masa
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you ada lah these three
perangai melayu yes
ya lah fikir pasal duit lah sekarang memang okay
but kalau nak ambil one more
and kalau
personal betul
why kenapa
tetapi kan ambil lesen
nak fikir pasal sekolah so kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena divide
exciting itu memang lah but sekarang I pun tak ada kereta
ya tetapi kalau tak ada macam
kalau tak ada use for kereta
macam waste of time itu sahaja
ya lah I sudah biasa sangat naik public transport
yes yang pasal the drawing mm yes
it's like an accomplishment dalam hidup
not seven wonders ke
I think so wah kaabah sendiri pun tak tahu
okay so america then europe tak ada tempat lain dah ke
apa try studying
tapi itu lah
change starts with you so kalau nak start saving
mm you know boleh is very forgiving
tapi nak kena tengok juga jangan potong too close
apa semua nak kena ada allowance
so I think it got a bit derailed sebab exam kan banyak focus dekat exam so dah tak fikir sangat lah like I think
ya so I think maybe selepas
yes selepas exam maybe dapat masuk balik lah then
ya tapi bila buat sendiri is tak as senang as dia tunjuk
ya memang banyak video tetapi I underestimate how
mm I thought is macam yang
speaking of I think my kawan-kawan are planning like a dinner or something
uh tak dah bangun selepas itu tertidur tapi bangun balik dah macam terlajak
mm tengok cerita incredible tales
tapi cikgu itu forgiving lah dia cakap okay tak apa lah it's late but I will mark as present
mmhmm apa dia
err ya I agree as well belum buat banyak pun macam uh
nanti dah tak ada moral lah
ya tapi bunuh satu pun dah macam mana
otter satu biasa pun dah besar macam mana

bila dah hidup sendiri kan tak akan ambil
mm tetapi kalau fikir balik kan if you're not there at home is
what's the point and ya menyeksa lagi ada
walaupun kucing boleh hidup sendiri daripada anjing kan
mm tetapi if you're not home
tetapi nak kena ingat juga it's a living thing
ada corner lah
ya lah there's no saturation of market lah dah tak ada orang nak beli and daripada

ah ya takpe ah
macam standard ah cakap english ah okay okay not bad

but what about kau
eh by the way kau watch uh umbrella academy
aku rasa they talking about like
kau tahu like
but it's like a natural thing ah for kau kan and some it's honestly called talent ah to be that smart at that young age
yes correct ah betul
so in a way pun kau like grateful lah for what has happened because it made you too because
a'ah overrated pun
aku still wouldn't hear it lah to be honest cause
but also don't need say ah cause kitanya radio our campus radio pun overplayed their songs ah
if kau realise
eh I wanted to join eh come on lah aku nak join sia
aku feel like okay this will definitely make sense but
then they will need to be make more and make more then the space especially kat Singapore kan kitanya country small
oh mak yes
low-key kalau ada ah eh
but kau imagine though
confirm yes correct betul betul aku agree
work is a an activity apa
ah we can call it a food lah that I know you won't be jelak of is sweets lah
because normal lah everytime aku nampak kau selalu makan gula selalu makan gula ada benda ah kat dalam mulut kau selalu
K kau rindu sekolah sangat ke huh
standard confirm oh yang that sebelah drink store that western the burger
betul lah betul lah cause before you eat with your mouth you eat with your eyes ah they say
but here's another thing though aku nak kena tanya kau
takde no such thing
dia kau dah check up
awal pe
ya I know aku dari tadi nampak ah so that's why but it's okay understandable
so kau boleh cakap dengan diri kau macam
takde I cannot
just a little bit just a little bit eh perang ah just a little bit jer
head ah kirakan head of department
but I mean actually not that bad especially yang that time ah
aku dengan cyprus kena caught kena kat toilet
err suruh jumpa miss tan mister adrian and that time mister adrian was a ah
then dia cakap dengan aku pasal all these actions
then dia cakap dengan aku oh your punishment is going to be you have to go to
no thank god he he just he just then I'm like eh serious ah aku stress sia twenty twenty class what the fuck
mmhmm eh macam tahu jer not bad macam tahu jer

ah sorry ada orang ada girlfriend takpe takpe takpe
I mean in a way kau boleh train kan that shit too
oh like macam straight away not bad
not only macam pasal discount price and shit cause
ah apa lagi soalan kau tengah tengok ni
dia ada berapa soalan sia
yeah that few is berapa lah
aku definitely heard of the word
apa ah
macam detective ah aku ingat aku ingat
but honestly ah aku like just like that ah the aircon on the bus
sekarang most to most yang buat joke is
aku lah
ah susah sia
okay ah but I understand uh pun kau have your own things going and you know I wish you well and shit lah
no the best time was when we were year one kat J seven
uh kau setakat kat belakang I don't know why you looking at fish hooks and okay lah that guy interested

I mean aku understand lah aku understand
oh merepek

you are better off now kau tengah buat what kau love honestly we still keep in contact so that's also good lah
kau wait ah kau tunggu aku I think I got told you this before bila aku ada motor aku datang situ kalau tak kita lek lek jap
uh tak aku kalau lagi four more
tapi takpe kau tunggu jer
ah boleh boleh enjoy that's that's my main goal lah to be honest lah eh
ah fifteen minutes twenty fifteen minutes boleh ah fifteen minutes
if aku
aku not sure sia
do kau have something in mind I'm really not sure sia
especially kau dengar Converse seven to ten august that time
tak tahu tadi terhang sikit ah eh
I'd say looks ah cause honestly body you can do anytime but if your looks rabak kan and your face ah that's it got nothing to do already just give up unless
body can do anytime makan makan makan
how about kau
wah bagus bagus abeh honest eh
it's just aku rasa mainly cause of apa body type is it that kind of thing
ah yes I mean at that point of time pun kan so like kau just need more experience a little bit more experience that's all
kau tengah cakap pasal which food court ada
yes is it that one yang kau tengah cakap that food court
dorang taruk those uh what do they call that
like feed properly the chicken that kind of thing kan bukan macam give them some
air and
kau punya melayu hancur sia apa yang oksigen apa sia
I aku tak pernah sia cakap like oksigen like
ever in malay maybe that's why aku tak tahu ah this is my honestly my first time hearing it
exactly and the fact that macam mana eh all those dormitory workers
but it's just sad that they have to live inside there until aku tak tahu bila
actually that's what they should do sia after like phase two pasal kita semua quarantine kat rumah kan and shit
then you slowly move to phase two which is yang kau cakap implement tu and then slowly gradually macam sekarang ah
tapi sekarang tak lepas phase two jer semua orang keluar
but you know the problem now is also pasal
older generations them and their phone tak payah cakap ah
aku pernah experience like customers old auntie lah
kau pun heard ah the reason they
pun is just cause the economy is dropping that's all
oh ya ya aku nampak
at least also like go out with a purpose are ada orang just keluar setakat untuk lepak
ah yes okay ya betul betul betul
kau nampak national day
as in like tak yah cakap ah
like a lot of people then aku nampak like a tweet on Twitter that says like
because nobody is following the safety measure rules whatsoever one metre apart takde jer semua lama just one big ass
ah takpe lah president
eh but area kau ada fireworks
but like you know romantics sikit who knows bring you to bali
I would like settle down if one country if one country aku boleh settle down kan aku would settle down at
have you seen the mountains there just online aku macam
but if kau nak peace you know do your work alone enjoy retirement shit
that place untuk aku is perfect ah
K the other side aku dengar it's like something about
aku nak quit sia aduh
but ni macam last minute ah aku didn't know that err our school provided a bursary
cause aku didn't know until miss tan text aku like
ya I think so but then aku fikir balik eh bukan aku dah nak graduate april oh sekarang jer baru dia nak bagi
oh nenek eh kau tinggal sorang kan dalam
asal room kau gelap sia kau tak
oh takde apa
subuh so technically kau should
aku nya time eh
eh hamzah um that time bapak have the iphone eleven the plan um starhub
um iphone eleven know got sale ah macam tak sure kalau um the plan worth it or not because now my plan I think is um twenty five dollars
think like macam I think about ten ah
macam wasted kan gitu so calculate um macam
um so that means I one month macam about extra thirty dollars then kalau dua tahun
nanti ah nanti tanya bapak uh I think he he save a voucher or what
but for me I I use only macam about ten gitu lah
ah tak banyak ah ah
phone ni six S plus ah I think since um which year ah since twenty sixteen uh remember that time we go which wedding ah medan ah medan ingat
ah siapa namanya kahwin tu kak lia eh kak lia kan
ah medan ah that time so that time I think eh that no that time medan twenty seventeen twenty fifteen eh tak tak sure ah twenty sixteen kan
oh no I don't want upgrade it's maybe four years ah macam gitu ah
the lowest the lowest macam fifty five dollars jer yang the next expensive one is I think eighty kan something like eighty ah ya but I don't want I don't need the what data what thirty all this thirty
tak pakai pun kan
bila dia dia ah bila keluar ah when bila release
but the specs um similar to uh yang which iphone
actually ada ada iphone eight plus tak ada kan
oh masih ada lagi eh
um mana yang lagi mahal um iphone eight or
iphone eight iphone eight ada tu kan face face kan
I think iphone ten pon ada kan uh face
ambil iphone ten ah pelik ah
oh uh today pergi sekolah apa

yesterday there's ada satu interview eh recruiter kan

that is that makes sense what kalau tak nobody will also macam
full time but because sekarang kan I teach tuition kan
no but tuition only left lagi dua bulan ah until um october kan O level atau N level kan
last week I just start um this new student ah budak melayu ah budak apa N level ah N level dekat bukit batok
no I think now they they make more centres ah I think they I think dia orang there's no way they can do in a big hall what kan
then yang students yang lain all pergi normal classroom ah
I think same time ah the the whole singapore mesti same time what kalau tak later how to know that you know
I think part time got got a a lot job ah macam yang this um
kat mana eh um
for part time mesti commit
for me best is um data analsyt atau business analyst
atau system analyst ah
kena twenty four seven support
it's like like to me not much difference right kalau work from home then
I think python macam python for me is okay lah because it's a
actually high level is the the code that macam can be readable kan so kalau macam if a human being baca the code
ah there's this code thing called fortran right betul tak
then what ni apa this there's this language namanya C hash eh apa C hash eh is it
but it's um the pace is what like dia ikut which um which language
I don't really like to like build you know macam build all the app
ingat tak um during the year twenty
my job mostly like ah then investigate ah gitu
ah error error dia akan email kan so times ten kan times ten
like macam need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
like enriching to do this kind of work but yang tak suka is the I really benci is support twenty four seven on the phone ah
the like not say down time ah macam
nenek boleh pergi balik ah nenek
um I think tak boleh ah but eh but dia right yang syakilah iman is maybe ah I think
eh I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think berlambak ah mail dia
no ah oh auntie I always just say cik cik rozi ah cakap something ah
then dah you all dah makan belum
semua tengah tidur kan
tak dia punya ingredients kan beli kat pasar atau uh
you mean the ikan is the the one that is boneless eh
um mesti
ya the sauce right then pour on top kan just just tuang
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make ah macam mix and match
apa apa ya like
tomato semua ah tomato um pineapple
ah capsicum sedap I like I like the capsicum
the yang makan masa ah kan
for for us actually if let's say our our family kan macam nak ada maid kan
kalau siapa dah kahwin kan atau like we have our own house kan maybe separate ah let's say I
no I mean like one maid ah because like the maid tak payah just stay at one house do all the work what because sometimes mak ada nenek ada kan so maybe can
the maid is okay then we we must bayar for the transport
and maybe give them time off ah kan kalau
tak complain atau tak
feel macam pressure kan we we like they call it give and take ah
don't over over work the maid lah kalau maid is okay then okay what you know
this one maybe we can plan ten ah next time because bapak kan dah tua<malay kan nanti mak
like at least like the maid boleh masakkan actually the best kan the maid masak
right because if the maid masak right then we just need to buy the stuff ah then sekarang
tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh just order online kan
but any online pasar or not macam pasar food eh buy meat or chicken ada eh
but I mean like the betul punya pasar online maybe maybe
no because fairprice jual beef tak eh because beef is very hard to find right
um macam mana the person tahu
oh no oh but means the device kan then the the user mesti jalan to
our our house all small what america everything is so big kan I mean america everything you see dia punya rumah besar-besar or I think european some also the house big kan
but the device is uh quite mahal kan I think thousands right
so seven days tak payah pergi kerja ah just somewhere else ah
itu hari cakap open the ikea but oh but now open lah
so nobody can meet their friends to eat what so they just have to eat cepat-cepat makan then then just balik class ah
but that that time weird you know ah dekat mana eh
apa nama kedai dia yang mister you you know orchid house dekat serangoon gardens tu
orchid house the the indian food macam mamak ah
mamak food
al-azhar gitu those kind macam woodgrove gitu ah
phase the first week of phase two kan atau I think I jumpa my friend during the phase two second week ah kan
phase two is about nineteen june kan so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend makan dekat tu ah orchid house
pelik ke so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird ah kan
mesti customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else kan because
because of the apa seating arrangement
and some people they apa like they in a group kan say eight people ah four four kan
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then bersembang lah dengan kawan-kawan kan
um I heard the store owner kan atau business owner dia orang call the
but sometimes we think oh it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you tengok news
eh but do do you think it's possible kan kalau dia orang make a system kan means by far away then they auto checkout
ah if the person off then tak boleh ah kan
ya the the app apa what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
it's good kan macam but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
actually that one bagus tau pasal you like eh hey google then the you can play spotify
K because my my friend he dia pakai google home eh google phone tau so I use apple ah but the that time I stay punggol also share with him kan
so he use the the what google assistance eh yang cakap the voice ah
dia cakap even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
ah macam macam mana nak tahu ah
no I mean macam mana nak nak tahu that whether they are listening to you or not
no I think if let's say oh but I think google kan macam mana eh if you like ask question kan like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say um oh sorry we cannot
something basic ah like uh what time is it maybe dia tahu ah kalau tanya something like um
my friend eh my friend singaporean kan but then he dia study full time dekat pergi luar ah
then dia punya apartment kan
then dia pun ada alexa I think now alexa better ah because
I think that one bukan maybe that one is it thailand something ah I cannot remember
ah the ah the dekat mana eh ah this place ah that time I went interview tanjong pagar go it's called what guoco tower ah
so when you tap kan dia dia tahu which which place to go to ah like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down what
I got here lah so I mean initially we plan to meet pukul dua belas gitu but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay lah I want to naik basikal then now I'm regretting it lah
hot pun it's not tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah like the past few days it's not really that got lah but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place tak tak jauh sangat it's eleven kilometers
and the weather cuaca pun okay juga lah so I mean it's okay you got lah so I mean it's
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law tapi dia cakap difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling tak payah pakai mask pe
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask yang kena and the one the government kasih atau the one that they government suruh lah
I just use the kain like the one the the they call it the kain untuk muka
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent ah barang-barang kena muka like some debris you just go to uh face what's that at least apa dia ada protection because if not like
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is tempat kosong so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre lah maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to cepat juga lah but then
then some more ada construction tempat construction so
so the tempat construction is just debris ah then the habuk-habuk masuk hidung then I was like my nose a bit itchy lah then I mean
okay ah then ya so that that was the time yang cause that one tempat dekat dengan forest forest sana because it's the ulu ulu tempat ulu sana so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya lah err lalat masuk lah hidung
eh lalat masuk mulut
I mean literally it's not at house anymore lah dia dah dekat luar lah
eh ya dia masuk lah I mean
you are cycling penat-penat jauh it's like you are jauh then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna pakai mulut eh pakai your hidung ya it's kena use your pakai mulut lah you
then by chance the thing masuk and nasib tak masuk my the the air pipes it masuk my esophagus straightaway so I just telan
dia makan betul ah I also tak berak-berak so okay ah
sakit no ah it just
I think it's just extra protein ah I don't know apa dia makan kat that ulu area and I mean forest I mean housefly they flies are basically came from maggots what then then they evolve
so I don't know maybe there's something they rotten there then I'm just extra protein lah abeh some people confirm makan maggot what good
you want nak makan bat
currently I'm taking kat the the ubi sana lah I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing ah like naik basikal if you exercise you go distance and if you work pakai kerja deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also lah like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license lah bike license boleh tolong apa like like two in one so just settle everything
aku pun tak tahu but I I think depends lah I think now the the rate dia dah really drop dah jatuh so
cause I think now there's a influx dah banyak I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now kerja ah apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a ada grabfood dengan foodpanda eh apa deliveroo account ah I don't really need dapat masuk joined foodpanda lah so I think
I those two is enough ah and then now also masih because I'm now masih like recently kena diagnosed dengan hyperthyroidism so my saya I just sakit sangat lah I just susah nak nak exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down ah just do less
I don't remember calling it docket uh I think the maybe dia orang it's a foodpanda punya benda ah pasal for apa grabfood dengan deliveroo they call it ah incentive so dapat incentive like you deliver ten ah
thirty forty dollars that was itu pun only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one kerja lah the orang lain semua kerja kerja so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
competing competing orang-orang lain semua ah so
that is grabfood lah for for deliveroo incentive punya ada every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
like you in a in a pickle you just call jer nanti they just will assist you ah tolong just tolong you like just like that grabfood you call sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat
oh ya ya depends lah kalau dia orang nak kasih tip dia orang nak kasih tip ah I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself tak ada tip culture what it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip nanti dia orang fikir eh ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
ya they give ten dollar I tip just kasih ah
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app atau the cash so they will just give you cash ah like from singapore's tipping
food their tipping like their the the person the company they ambil duit the the that it was supposed to tip but to you so it's like
rabak ah but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip ah so that's what the company the company
well I mean because tak ada duit selalu no pocket no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment pakai dia punya that account lah so ya so my biggest is paling banyak is ten dollar ah lah but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar lah itu dapat terus sepuluh dollar just just the just deliver and it was a tempat pun like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically tempat dia is like depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan then he just like maybe
fifty meter and lima puluh meter jer I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar dia orang kasih then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter pergi angkat itu jer
been a long time ago lah like dah lama juga ah I've gained back the empat ratus tu so
like four empat about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories ah barang like
it's err I mean you want to do something you on the road ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun it's you what
the thing is sometime pun orang like you rider you will sometimes take naik basikal you I mean then you anything happen like then eh guai lan padahal sometimes you forget eh your your means your safety first lah you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you lupa about yourself lah so it's quite stupid ah sometimes like you
we are paid by duit apa by by by time so the time you cepat you get more money so kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu green green light belum green light tu showing but you want nak to go you want to go
ya lah so safety also have to come first ah because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk lah but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian jalan jalan lah so like senang
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I since I can go two in one go to the road and pergi the pedestrian pathway tapi
kadang-kadang pun singapore drivers
memang semacam ah
err talking about check back blind spot tadi on the way here already I was I was really know I was
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on um from the main road going straight so dia dari the the the other side nak masuk the main road from the zebra crossing ah the junction so the
the driver dia tak nampak ah I like I was really prepared to break from jauh but I was already dah macam dah nak
I was really like to be beside her in that main road dia just jam break ah then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like dia not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her ah
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour boleh nampak apa dari jauh then like there was a car like
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't tak ternampak tak nampak so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break ah
so she just she jam break herself ah then just I hear dia cakap sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her lah
oh ya err so sekarang I'm taking my bike license lah like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
I mean it's a good thing for a license lah you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are dari the cyclists ah you are like basically the food chain ah kat bawah sekali
ah tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh
ya like I think then I think the instructor pun cakap you because some people dah dia dah ada three A license of the three class three three license
then they dia orang nak ambil class two B then they then I think they instructor pun cakap ah you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but sekarang nak nak naik motor then now you know orang motor apa yang jadi so just now I was doing practical lah I did revision but then I think what reason siang sangat because
like cepat sangat ah because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
uh prac five is the revision dah I mean it's the internal cost lah but I already cleared that just that I did revision because dah lama tak naik motor
six kat luar
oh you mean keluar from the to the main road ah yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also naik basikal so I can see apa yang or like what's happening ah kata orang too happening sia I also macam takut ah nak nak nak nak keluar that main road just to naik basikal
I because I choose ubi pasal pun like dekat dengan basikal so I think I I mean naik basikal sana okay lah I don't want to naik basikal every time go pevery time go
I mean aku pun don't mind lah kena ride on some something ride on me but
depends lah so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay lah once in a while occasion so like how aku naik naik basikal sini to to here then also I need to go back naik basikal so depends lah but then nak every time nak take lessons no thanks ah
I will just take public but then now pasal nak dekat so I naik basikal to jer lah
dua puluh enam dua puluh enam the practical like depends lah kadang-kadang in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
I mean basikal pun okay for exercise like I mean comes to dapat motor pun okay lah you
like for transportation because now also tengah like belajar pun like easy lah like boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik public abeh public tempat penuh sangat then you cannot sit down terus macam
I don't know lah I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always macam
I I I don't know lah macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik
singapore I rasa lah I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the I mean the buses everything is err I mean reliable just that I don't know why ah
I was I rasa kubur-kubur dan kena you dug up the kubur then underground then hantu dah semua datang
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike kat sana is one sixty
I don't know ah I want to jimat duit pun okay lah but then I want to nak like I mean nak nampak handsome sikit ah so
tak handsome sangat lah
ya like ah muka aku pun buruk sangat so kalau pun tak tak boleh tolong tapi at least kalau at least I from a seven maybe masuk naik atas ke nine ke eight ke all over there ah
you pandai juga eh motor kau
I think when I think kalau nak beli motor pun I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe uh as a second second owner ah not gonna buy until dah nak habis maybe maybe
kalau ada duit of course obviously I will buy ah like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out ah like
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing ah macam like that's because I would be macam jauh away from singapore ya like for enam bulan so I think see how first lah
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing lah ada ada datang balik terus the tyre hilang tinggal handlebar jer kat sana but park kat carpark tinggal handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing lah but
ah I so that's why I need to see first most probably tengok lah most probably I just comeback
then uh I think most probably I will still nak ambil class three three license lah I mean
I mean we err like uh nak buat family cannot be bringing your child kalau ada child naik naik naik motor pe I means still can lah but then like cannot lah like but singapore I mean were asking if want to naik naik bus pe public but then
like when it comes to reliability macam barang-barang selalu breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
aiya I think that one too vague lah like everything can be improve lah semua benda boleh boleh improve pe ada benda merepek pun boleh improve
so tengok lah like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much ah nanti benda problem nanti then you are relying that thing benda rosak then you are
so pandai-pandai ah so that one also cannot rely too much lah
oh ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn ah berbual for I mean this conversation we are having so
which um the surprise yang paling besar yang orang like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
oh so like ah okay okay so duduk lama-lama then suddenly you just don't know either dia orang datang so they put your car then what happen next
so we basically dah kereta you just waiting waiting then dia orang dah sampai tempat pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park lah so then after that dia orang nak bawa to the place to eat lah so and so tempat makan dia at where exactly
okay now let's understand so siapa like you who siapa who was there like siapa kat sana semua like is it your all your soccer mates ah is it just them or ada orang lain celebrating
okay lah I mean ya I mean the also quite gerek lah but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday ah orang like you are with lah people you love orang kalau kawan help your family depends like everyone like ada orang macam nak celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves tak nak orang involved
everybody orang celebrate differently ah so I think it's good lah like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want ah ada some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite dia padahal dia tak nak celebrate they are just nak lepak kat rumah
nak tidur tu jer so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want ah
just kasih duit jer I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff ah I think like ah you give me duit I I can spend myself you give me a voucher kat also I happy dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah
so I think that will be is enough untuk like for me lah tapi
I mean it's good lah you like your friends chip in everything for barang-barang for you
right your your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting lah like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are eh apa like what is happening and like
tengah buat apa ni what they doing sia you are dalam dalam hati is just takut tapi it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say ah duit vouchers are a good thing ah like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just orang just acquaintances you just tanya the mutual friend like eh apa dia suka ah like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to apa
pergi shopping rather you maybe buy a like get err voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also tak shopping banyak sangat
and ya I think the typical barang for guy is orang kasih apa eh kasih those perfume I guess the the they demo apa lagi uh they don't call it perfume dia orang panggil apa eh oh cologne ah cologne but I mean
I don't know lah jangan nak nak step atas cakap perfume sudah lah for me lah okay but
err tapi ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch lah like senang ah unless orang dia macam those uh yang benda benda the all the watches dia dah dah dah ada rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course lah tak payah fikir pasal tu
even grand but then orang orang orang siapa seh ni aku tak berbual then terus it's like
it's like err it's like eh ah like awkward lah you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand lah so so orang kalau fikir okay invite orang lebih lebih padahal you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself tak payah tak payah no need to hide your personality gitu
okay that is I mean birthdays lah but then it's like I mean to me you fikir fikir birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like apa that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person lah dah dah dah tua dah lama or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
okay whatever you said that one orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat like you I mean like birthday birthday ah
tak payah nak mm susah sangat like what you said kalau orang nak book tempat pun as a as an example kalau the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december orang orang confirm like it's gonna be fully book lah so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya lah there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday nak barang-barang semua yang bagus ah like I mean for a celebration lah it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays ah once in a lifetime ah you can you are gonna be that age for once only uh unless err I don't know percaya reincarnation that one different topic lah
okay uh uh ya I guess that's susah ah tapi I think dah nak they by their by their age
jauh lah like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december ah then you have to book very early but then
banyak banyak hotel pun nak book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard lah pasal you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating ah
okay lah ya I mean ya lah I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya lah COVID sekarang buat everything susah even
not even just nak keluar holiday like nak keluar untuk kerja overseas is like the deployment kat overseas is orang semua susah susah is like now everybody kena in singapore like thinking
like they're like whether this apa apa this career dia orang tengah buat is on hold pasal of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point lah not just birthdays ah so like all other like holidays or even like work ah kerja kerja critical this is a it's like a
a good err thing that is I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened lah so like orang can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect ah like in the future is this ah like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead jauh jauh lain ah
I mean the furthest I went paling jauh is U like the I went to that was bila kecil-kecil ah los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember apa yang I did
I mean it helps lah you you got you like you already plan lah nak pergi okay okay I want aku nak pergi jepun so I want to like at least belajar a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
taberu makan like like all those ah keyword like taberu makan and ah coco desuka like ni nak pergi err like go where nak pergi mana go where some something like that lah so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard lah nak cari makan makanan halal but then
I mean yang the big staple food there is you can just I mean minta so I guess ikan sushi nasi and one
I mean hokkaido no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only yokohama that eh no oh no tokyo is lagi tinggi dari yokohama so no that's the highest I've been is to tokyo so but
I think hokkaido tempat tempatnya ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff ah benda-benda cream is usually benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk I mean that that that latitude tinggi-tinggi pun memang understandable lah so ya I mean hokkaido is when it comes to makanan tempat benda sejuk lah dessert
I think it's not also just that lah I mean you also tempat
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also dia orang pun cantik juga I mean their complexion is there tempat pasal there tempat sejuk if it's cold then you don't really sweat much tempat so it depends ah
I mean that's understandable lah you see orang-orang yang mat salleh orang those memang the further north
but the percentage point tak tinggi sangat lah so it's ya lah I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends ah
honestly I think it's a waste of money orang like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just takut eh orang also pergi then I never pergi it's like I cannot talk about it sial berbual abeh then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that dia orang dah pergi so that can talk
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot untuk nak anuh dah just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite merepek ah orang nak belanja then up to them
kaunye favourite drama apa
boleh macam-macam ah I mean you can go korea korean drama
actually aku tak tahu like legit
eh tapi I mean like you always tengok ni apa
so what you macam you punya favourite drama
oh jadi kau most of the time tengok yang variety show ah
aku rasa is tujuh hari
okay apa cerita dia
bedek ah
aku sekolah then
ah yes kita semua more of like
itu actually rabak gila seh
betul betul I mean kita tengok
kita selalu tengok I think YouTube
yes ada dia punya timing serious gila
that's my macam go to err
it's the it's the only time that I baca surat khabar
a'ah betul kau habis cerita kau
aku kat tepi tengok aje dah habis belum
langgar tak timing dia
thailand drama not for me I mean aku tak tengok sangat thailand drama
yang macam comedy movie because they quite funny ah
aku tahu lah I mean
so obvious cam dia ada adam apple and
ada like they very tall for guys dia punya features macam very tall then very rough hands
that's macam
dia punya telltale sign ah
now now because of surgery also susah nak apa tu nak err nak bezakan lelaki ngan perempuan you can lacking of open you know you know
oh ya actually aku tengok juga kat Facebook that one oh my god like really look like ya really look like a woman
that that's the dangerous part kau imagine eh kau imagine macam
uh aku tak tahu aku bawa balik ni
uh oh my god aku tak boleh imagine aku tak boleh kau imagine reaction ayah ngan mak
tapi long distance relationship apa
dia kat singapore abeh perempuan tu kat malaysia
so they just communicate by ni ah cam telephone ah like just call
boring pe kalau tak nampak
ya long distance relationship susah
tak ah I mean I got see like couple of my friends macam they take uh long distance relationship kan then it never work out
tak lah banyak perempuan tinggalkan lelaki
a'ah legit kau tengok ah boys to men kan
it's not a norm tapi macam it's a thing
I don't know the period ah I mean dua tahun apa I's quite long dua tahun
like you nowadays very susah ah nak dapat
ah dapat yang baik
more of like a kampung kampung area I mean that's quite good
kalau future wife I will look for if she macam religious
ah religious um pandai masak
pandai masak is important yes I know I know you I know you don't know how to cook but it's a fact kakak you nak kena tengok dia punya
oh ada banyak lah I mean um looks looks kalau looks wise kan aku tak macam
tak tak kesah sangat ah boleh cakap
ya I mean looks nowadays kan kau tengok eh looks doesn't matter lah for me looks doesn't matter but most of the time guys go for looks ah which pada aku is just uh
which pada aku is just uh not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to macam
bukan aku cakap not all aku tak cakap yang all beautiful ladies
perempuan lawa is basically jahat ah tapi
kalau katakan eh like ninety per cent
kalau from my point of view lah aku tengok dia ni lawa tapi oh dia buat kawan aku macam gini oh
it give you macam a thought ah macam so perempuan lawa macam gini ah
like my like nowadays it's more of kita judge the book by its cover kan
I mean you can judge a person based on dia punya personality first tapi sekarang most of the time they judge on looks
just because dia tak lawa eh dia ni macam gini ah dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu
last time is more macam they understand each other like
macam mak ngan ayah punya time is more ah wah aku suka dia K eh she's the one for me macam gitu like
like last time people is more of a macam loyal tau sekarang is more of K ah
ya attention kalau nak cakapkan they need attention ah
because now is kita living in a modern society tau so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with faham
tu pasal ah
that's why they need attention as like macam uh pleasure
not uh pleasure ah macam how to say ah
kalau married couple for me kalau nak attention is very hard ah
tapi kalau nak cakap kan eh um
aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku attention tapi kita ah macam you're not ah giving both
kau nak selalu cakap I need attention tapi you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things apa
no ah kalau nak cakapkan piece together all of it kan is susah juga pasal
sekarang is more like kita have different thoughts different feelings kita punya emotions all jumble up
jadi kita ah
and singapore eh kalau kau nak tahu eh singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world tau serious
because of the stress that macam kita put on ourselves just to survive every month
and singapore eh have the macam the highest divorce rate
mostly melayu lah tapi
it's very hard lah because nowadays more of like dia orang um
dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan tau
they fikir okay macam orang putih cakap yolo eh
you only live once kan so they never think macam ah beyond horizon tau
dorang just fikir okay uh aku nak party ah all the way but dia nak kena fikir juga
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going macam downhill ah
so pada aku wise eh nak cakap sekarang punya zaman is more stress lah basically
tapi yang penting eh daripada drama boleh pergi marriage
I mean like is like macam uh a playhouse tau
kau boleh buat mistake tapi kau boleh buat mistake tapi it's uh it's scripted ya it can be soft because you're in the playhouse kan
aku ada tu aku ada tu thought tau eh what if I were to become this guy this rich guy
what if I apa kata kalau aku jadi dia ni aku jadi dia tu
macam oh but it's not going to happen ah it's just that kau ada dia punya thought ah tapi end up macam kau face reality ah basically susah gila
kalau nak cakapkan drama
drama is okay cakap-cakap scripted kan
tapi aku lebih suka macam reality show
kau suka variety show variety show is most likely buat macam games talkshow api aku lebih suka macam aku tak tahu ah kalau kau tengok shark tank
it's about macam got an entrepreneur tau
entrepreneur apa pula eh
oh uh macam kau businessman
kau businessman so kau nak jual kau punya idea
ask people to support you lah macam gitu beyond this five people ah
I mean these five people at the end will uh will macam cakap ah okay aku akan sponsor kau kalau tak semua cakap big no ah
ah one of them can sponsor you two of them can sponsor jadi it depends ah on idea bagus tak
it's not voting basically macam kau datang sana kau ada idea okay kau nak orang tolong kau pasal this five people they are very uh
uh their influence is big tau and their market is big also jadi kalau kau amik dengan dia orang kan you will gain a lot
jadi that's why they a lot of people go there actually tapi that's why I like reality show it's not scripted
bondi rescue apa
kau jadi lifeguard
macam ni eh bay watch
so basically kau suka more of like cerita yang berkenaan dengan
kalau in-laws bukan adik ipar itu mertua
um brother in-law abang ipar
oh my melayu
so by the time the lifeguard actually masuk laut tu balik kan this couple dah face down
lemas ah drowning ah
abeh lifeguard tu macam sedih ah macam eh
tapi it's not their fault apa they they it's their job it's their job tapi
kadang-kadang it's not meant to be ah it's not meant to be
it's macam aku boleh cakap kan this world eh is scripted
macam K you cannot predict this one you cannot predict that one but like only god know lah macam
tuhan aje tahu when is your ajal when is your this one when is your that one
so you cannot predict ah if they are meant to die that means K ah mungkin diorang pergi somewhere better lah
oh macam err
it's ah macam mouth to mouth ah
oh that penat gila actually that one is very penat
diorang try to keep their emotion macam in check ah
it's like macam kau tahu cerita yang dulu kita masuk adam khoo workshop
pasal seratus orang dalam trap dalam bottle
abeh diorang work together just to save this one person's life
it's yang diorang actually got no where to go tapi dah ada this high macam it's a escape route escape route eh
so diorang ah cakap okay that means mungkin korang satu orang pergi keluar panggil orang datang
so diorang panggil budak ni ah budak ni pasal
it's not pasal ringan he's the
it's budak kan they they are all adults ah
kan is they kesiankan K so they so okay kau pergi panggil orang tolong kita I think about seratus orang gitu ah they all stack onto one another
then uh pangku yang budak tu ke atas then
then diorang pergi dia dapat escape ah budak tu
abeh bila dia datang balik dengan pertolongan eh it's too late
like the ninety nine people dekat botol tu kan died
that's macam gitu lah
they cannot save ya they cannot save everyone but it's great ah macam diorangnya job
guilty conscience ah betul
tak salah north depan south belakang
east kanan west kiri
oh dia cari bapa dia

dorang tak order cater tak I don't think is cater that wasn't cater pasal tak banyak orang datang
like they didn't invite a lot lah but then it's kat Zoom
then they like she invite kawan pun like secondary school just me and another person

movie romantic ini memang aku suka lah sebab aku ini suka nangis abeh tengok cerita-cerita macam gini I mean iya lah kalau kalau aku nangis kan memang dapat rasa emosi dia lah bila tengok orang berlakon

memang aku suka lah
dengan um iya lah I mean other than romance I'd say I mean comedy would be my go to ah
kalau aku ada time capsule being the very nostalgic person I am
jadi aku boleh iya lah kalau sekarang buka aku boleh tengok lah gambar-gambar tersebut kan
and iya lah fikir lah masa sebab dulu masa kita sepuluh sembilan sepuluh tahun tak banyak stress kan dalam hidup
kalau nak bandingkan dengan sekarang tak banyak risau tak tahu apa-apa about the world we don't know how bad the world is nowadays you know just think of yourself a more carefree time
whoa memang menarik itu jawapan dia
I mean duit itu memang penting lah kalau aku aku pun nak duit lah seratus billion dollars itu memang
tak tahu lah nak buat apa eh dah terlalu banyak sangat dah duit dia
um dalam keadaan dunia ini sekarang
aku akan wish untuk semua orang
dengan stable ah sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah
dunia ini pun semakin um semakin mahal untuk tinggal dalam susah untuk keluarga untuk survive kan
so yang pertama I would wish for poverty to end cause
I mean ya um liverpool is a good club I I would like to argue with that but aku rasa chelsea itu memang aku dah lama lah sokong so aku aku tak akan tukar minda aku
aku memang aku memang jealous lah yang liverpool menang title tahun lepas
tapi aku aku rasa kalau aku control chelsea sendiri aku janji tiap-tiap tahun kita akan menang itu aku pastikan so iya lah kalau aku dah sokong itu memang aku tak akan tukar lah eh
kegemaran lah yang
eh nasi pula lauk lemak
and aku and I really like it and I do not know how to make it so
kalau kalau boleh I want to become a journalist cause
iya lah betul lah memang
betul betul betul betul judgemental kan sekarang
so kalau aku boleh pilih
kalau jujur cakap aku nak pilih badan yang sihat lah
daripada muka yang handsome lah
aku akan pilih badan yang lebih sihat lah sebab lebih susah untuk nak turunkan berat badan daripada
lebih baik lah untuk orang lain kan
kalau orang itu badan dia memang bagus ke muka dia betul-betul handsome ke
apa that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
um I just why aku rasa hidup dekat singapura ini sebagai seorang remaja memang
memang laju lah untuk senang kata lah memang laju memang banyak stress banyak yang nak buat
dan ini baru sebelum orang masuk kerja ini belum lagi masuk kerja akan dapat lebih stress
culture di pada negara-negara di asia lah sebab iya lah benda macam um kesihatan mental ini memang
bagi keluarga melayu ke dekat asia ini memang tak diambil berat lah
untuk ibu bapa kan sebab cara mereka dengan cara kita kan tak sama mereka datang daripada zaman yang mungkin lebih susah lah jadi mungkin mereka tak anggapkan kesihatan mental sebagai sesuatu yang penting lah
you wish you could have helped to avoid it but tak boleh so
yang one way or another has been at fault
um when I think about the past twenty years living in singapore I'm very I'm very thankful and memang bersyukurlah dapat pergi sekolah belajar daripada kindergarten sampai sekarang dekat sekolah poly ambil diploma
um dapat buat dengan senang tak ada tak ada bill yang mahal-mahal yang kita kena bayar macam orang yang datang dari luar negara um dekat sini pun um healthcare macam dekat polyclinic ke dekat hospital pun
kita punya apa dia kita punya government kita dapat tolong dapat cover kan dapat bantu and ada um as someone who has two siblings with special needs
and um with that both of us would like to say thank you and have a nice day thank you terima kasih bye bye

dia tanam apa ah
ah err tanam papaya
and then those err macam seasonal like jagung now I think most of them is planting jagung lah or corn
uh jual pasar
massage mall shop is quiet very quiet takde orang
err because I think dulu dia orang harapkan apa
parlour over there err dah tutup
takde business
then dekat mana shopping mall err I would say
mall the mall is empty tak ramai orang
err like even on the street dekat dekat tengah jalan kat jalan tu kat nagoya tu is very quiet
I left on twenty nine october turun turun jakarta
jumpa kat jakarta then sama-sama balik err
balik balik batam
ah because nak jumpa
so they came from from from dia orang datang dari kampung

then before that you fill up so when you beli when you beli when you buy the ticket at the counter they would want to see this email
sampai kat singapore
I see is bila you dah after in front of the immigration tu there will be cisco officers lah so ah the the immigration will just go signal to them that say okay this one is like that lah
then from there I don't know macam you just wait dekat waiting area then all the all of you all of us will leave in one bus lah
but probably communicate they mention about communication wise is through err macam for me also I don't tak tahu pun where I'm going to
err they did inform ikut jer
I think but I think I think kalau kita tanya they will answer lah but then they didn't I think they are busy sorting out all the all the going here going there kan so that time communication wise I think ya
err nazi semua when you think of nazi is
not not until like that apa is all systematic what singapore
uh uh melebih melebih ah cara-cara the way they discuss sampai ah tu melebih lah kan jadi sama jer macam kita bantu tak tahu kita ikut jer pe
for me is fine but I got I got I don't know the the hotel that I'm in is a whole window so macam
I think they it helps lah dengan apa tu dengan kalau cermin is a small window cermin apa window kecil gitu I will akan rasa stress lah but but because it's a big window
so you know dapat tengok luar
tak stressful lah tu you got a lot of pass time kira kereta berapa ah that is what I do lah in the morning during err peak hours
err randomly kira-kira kereta jalan berapa banyak
macam you know alah you you you you you you are you are when you leave the country you should be prepared that you will be getting through this which is good enough that you get a good hotel a decent hotel apa
ah berpada ah you know some country another negeri dapat tempat is really really bad
for me is just alhamdulillah lah you know dapat makan you get a good hotel then after that a good bed for two weeks
I mean it's your it's choice lah how macam mana kita nak nak tu kan how how you nak nak how you want to make use of
what you have apa yang kita ada tu ah ya lah like I have for me iya lah tu lah kita duduk duduk tu kira appreciate but for me is that I got that room I I got that whole window I appreciate that very much lah

apa yang kita dapat apa-apa what our government give us ah yes yes yes
macam how to say ah macam
dulu macam kita for last time when we are here abeh kita tengok macam tengok this year how come you know  mak dia orang ni everyday dia punya cases naik macam tak jaga kan ah but when when you are there then you realise lah err that sometimes you know it's not that they don't macam dia orang tak nak
tapi looking at their economy
and with azan lain macam dia orang kan kebanyakkannya
gaji hari then kalau kena quarantine empat belas hari
ah betul itu lah itu dia orang tu nak quarantine susah macam kalau dia orang empat belas hari siapa nak kasih makan keluarga
ah tu macam tu lah kadang-kadang bukan dua orang tak nak kan but then
negara tu kan
nak nak quarantine lah that kind of stuff
oh macam sometimes the government ada kasih until when the amount to reach them it's it's not the original amount lah
ah along along along along the way itu
ada potong potong potong itu lah situasi sebetulnya
kurang uh uh
then also masa err some of them
no they don't dia orang tak nak pergi hospital sebab
kita too negative
apparently for every untuk setiap orang yang mereka hantar to pergi refer the hospital get money
not under table is government government bayar so hospital tu hospital tu will just say you're positive
ah ah satu
I just don't know that's why for untuk orang local ini nak pergi hospital
ah and if you speak to most of them semua semua gitu ah because initially I thought this is full macam tak this is bullshit right sekali but then berbual dengan orang sana berbual lepas tu orang-orang A orang B orang C kan
they give semua jawapan semua sama dia orang takut nak pergi hospital hospital dapat duit
no they no no they they check they check lah no they check they they pergi swab test tapi came back is positive lah
but bila bila kat sana ambil dah negative
for them janji aku dapat duit sudah
uh uh takut semua orang takut
tu lah kan
kesian but kesian orang-orang yang malaysia kan
ah tu macam you saw pasal saiful punya video tu
yang sebelah causeway ah just the causeway tu
setulang dekat ah tu ah R&F dia dekat woodland woodland checkpoint tepi tu
I I think I think dia nikah kat johor
huh I think singapore I mean kat johor yang dia married
officially tu dekat johor tak johor johor mm mm
sorry dia balik
under spouse kat johor malaysia
leave dengan no pay leave lah everything for two months in malaysia ah
eh duit balik tu lagi mahal tau
uh empat ribu enam ratus I was talking to him I was I was talking to him I say
even for malaysian malaysian pun dia orang nak kena bayar I think two thousand plus eh
ya malaysia ni dia orang dia orang how to say eh kalau step step step apa macam like they are strict lah ah tempatnya I don't know ah but I think if talking about strictness lah I think malaysia lebih strict than singapore for in terms of their immigration tinggi
tapi tu lah dia orang
kat yang dalam locally tu lah
that's why told him lah you know it depends have to bayar but then
is good investment then it's worth lah you know macam your
ah duit boleh apa ah duit boleh cari but then the moment you have to treasure because
was thinking of the best if I tak if I didn't go back
maybe nak tunggu dia buka maybe two zero two two right two years
okay lah for me is for myself personally is well macam
break lah one and a half month tak kerja ni sampai sekarang dah one week pun nak kerja malas body aching betul sia body aching
tengah hari balik kan tidur aku punya kaki sampai from top to bottom
ache semua sakit kaki
no lah I walk I walk in the room lah five five ten five to ten minutes one end to one end walk that's my exercise first week play game makan sikit ah second week habis
makan wake up ten o'clock breakfast is ready kan makan breakfast
twelve o'clock lunch will come I will but I will I mean keep the food ah pukul dua baru makan tidur tidur sampai pukul lima lebih bangun jer pukul enam
dinner dah sampai
makan dinner pukul lapan
pukul lapan ah watch movie and and then watch movie ten o'clock eleven tidur
pagi bangun lagi the last two weeks last one week the cycle is like that
my toklang tu I got one page lah it's uh batam concierge
when the border reopens err ada plan ah this transportation
macam-macam I can provide lah because okay I was I'm inspired by my neighbour
dia hari-hari before this COVID kat rumah jer main dengan anak pakai seluar pendek lepak you know
then I was talking to him but the last one month tu
ah every night kita berbual then he did he he inspire he is very inspiring lah
so he made so he told me you know abang abang pernah nampak saya kerja tak memang tak pernah saya hari-hari kat rumah lepak
and dia buat is a
so dia bilang bang saya tak pernah saya pun tak pernah jumpa saya punya tamu so he never meet his guest before everything is done online
uh and and and he you know he looking at him starting from nothing tiba-tiba ada kereta ada ada bus uh uh is all made is all from from from from travel lah
I think I think for them even ticket tu rupanya selama ni ticket
majestic pun dia ada
uh then even apa tau
you can only extra biasa lah upselling ah kan you pay extra
you get express lane so when you come ada orang dengan your name masuk dalam tak payah queue
ah so like I was like bang try takpe bang abang tak payah buat apa-apa abang
I was thinking eh macam boleh belajar dengan dia lah kan how he how how how he did lah
oh masuk
when you tengok eh it's a it's a niche lah a'ah exactly exactly
someone dah tahu kan
exactly people get the idea right orang akan ikut because I believe also there's a lot of macam err local singaporean guy who got married to
berani cuba you know
all these different kind of food ah kan ah dah berani tau so as as as long you make it halal I mean is halal then orang akan dia orang orang melayu akan try tak macam dulu orang melayu takut nak makan ah sekarang
more I mean they are adventurous lah dia orang berani apa
ah berani try ini other kind of food
macam saturday sunday nak
ah ya lah but normally by ten eleven thirty weekend twelve o'clock eleven twelve baru order masuk
normally like that ah ten to two balik rumah tidur
but if I want to continue dapat lebih lah kan tapi for me rest nak kena rest lah
oh tu baju putih tu eh
kalau balik habis ah
ah balik
that's always that's always the case lah kan balik jer habis
I was thinking mana tahu yang mana ni ni orang-orang ni
oh a'ah ada trail lah
dari tadi ah orang keluar turun
tempat-tempat gini oh semalam aku hantar kat mana eh semalam food at nine o'clock ah eight o'clock hantar dekat bukit timah
baru pukul lapan dah rasa aduh tak boleh balik I I after nine I don't send bukit timah area already
actually it's not ah apa for us the feeling ah cause
you can see the people over there ya kadang-kadang aku masuk malam pukul sepuluh orang berani tau macam perempuan
you know the the the sebelah situ dalam dalam they will go jogging alone you know ya and I've seen like I think I didn't think bukan orang local lah expats kan pregnant at about eleven o'clock walking
dekat tu that that stretch of roads ah macam kita like night ah
tak pantang ah dia orang a lot you know
rumah dia orang astaghfirullahalazim ada satu rumah kat dalam pokok dekat dia punya so called dia punya garden tu pokok dia macam pokok besar
dia relax jer rumah dia orang ah besar-besar gitu ah besar-besar
ah pokok-pokok
tak tahu lah besar pokok tu no okay lah pokok kapas pokok apa yang apa tu yang ada daun-daun panjang apa
nampak kat ayer rajah boon keng oh dia punya tu kan
all the stick tu kan lebat you know like tebal you know
petang alamak ni kalau malam ni at night jalan ni oh
eh betul lah kat situ yang kat boon keng ah
sini ah sini ah kat colonial mm mm
okay so from my understanding right apa tu
the kadi is you book the kadi from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them apa tu
takpe lah it's okay ah
it's okay tak payah banyak-banyak then ya
oh okay jadi kalau kadi tu macam stay further but you select that kadi because you prefer also okay lah oh
boleh ah
tapi I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
oh I see that means kalau if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
oh I I I I takut what or not I takut go in ah then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend kan then is charges takde eh
tapi on that day is your date available already lah on the
oh I see so kirakan before the date available
you go in you select the kadi so err I mean you play with the form tapi you don't submit
oh I I was thinking of doing that tapi macam takut tersubmit then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference ah the the charges ah and then ya so but I was also curious ah I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very err sought much sought sought after lah so don't want to make the mistake ah then that time you book masa tu nya err it's a sunday
mesti popular kan but then err
takut tak dapat kan
dia punya cause the dad is bukan is a non-muslim jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke I think sepuluh then
oh I think about ten ah ya but dia ada lagi satu err punya susah lah pasal um dia nya kadi kan dia tak boleh apa tu
err kalau buat dekat err location lain kan dia nya kadi cannot be yang full time staff
so full time staff sana ada about tiga orang so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english ah so my err number of kadi shrink shrink then entah abeh sekarang nowadays I cannot see the kadi reviews on the web eh dulu got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
he's okay he's fast I prefer pasal dia nya dia nya style is like
berbual sikit then go
ah itu lah ada satu err kadi tu dia quite quite
very eloquent ah tapi bila I tengok dia nya video kan
ya pasal sekarang I know yang satu kadi ni yang I identified this salim jasman I saw
cara dia buat macam betul relax ah err he just
tapi bagus ah because you tak ingat then that means also no stress lah bila baca baca jer ah
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds baku ya
ya lah ya lah tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga ya
tapi yang kadi tu is your family punya err acquaintance ah
oh tapi by then you don't know who that colleague is lah
okay mm okay jadi kirakan my plan sekarang is to go to the website fill up all the details then tapi bila dia punya date available submit straight mm
oh tapi dia to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through kan okay
mm okay same here okay jadi kalau time slot dia is err macam mana tu satu kadi can have more than one time slot ah
okay and then the charges untuk err this registration ada tak
tapi the marriage prep course tak payah kan
tapi yang yang dia tanya tu is masa jumpa kadi
okay yang dia interview tu is
yourself your err bride the the wakil
the wakil from your your wali ah
okay so so sebelum interview dengan kadi is you jumpa the head of the first
oh so jadi yang dekat tu jumpa dia punya punya
oh and tu masa during that time will be the time dia minta to any prep marriage prep course or he ask you to go ah oh that's after oh
okay berapa eh
tiga ratus lebih kan I think dengar-dengar macam tiga ratus lebih
okay oh dia masa tahun bila baru dia cakap tak compulsory eh
huh ye ke oh okay
harus ah
betul juga wah tapi masa tu tak ada wedding cake
pasal dia single single layer kan
ye lah ye lah
tapi yang cake ni is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay
sekarang nowadays they offer macam hotel one they offer dummy cake just to for the photo taking
oh yang jaga makeup okay
mm mm nowadays got pak andam
mm pasal nak ikat dia punya bunga eh
tapi sekali jer kan maybe before the dia nikah jer kan
tapi mak andam sampai the whole day mah
sama lah
cuma cuma dia punya masa tu thinking is dia nak pergi sana cepat so dia ada time to makeup lah tapi
for bride lah ya you dah plan pe
oh tu tak boleh jadi
tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh seh
kirakan sekarang ni macam they are macam err they messed up the err planning
some some some mak andam because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning lah okay
okay dia panic lah okay
kirakan flexible lah okay okay uh huh
mm jadi kirakan kalau macam if we do nikah and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
oh kirakan bukan pasal delay pasal they earn more lah no lah we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
tapi oh but you know how their charges are is like per whole oh not oh
mm tapi prata okay
okay jadi mak andam is not requirement unless you have err several outfit change
oh okay okay jadi sama lah I think for my side I think I don't want to have mak andam I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have err ya
I I even thought of what you know because dekat err katong sana kan there are many err salon ya then we thought err go there early ya
ya cause very close eh because yang grand mercure ada banyak salon ya how good ah that's why I have to go there okay
ya dia pun I email juga mm
most likely we also will do the same thing lah kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi ah the day macam one off saja lah
oh okay mak andam is for rental cause they got special rate
tapi of course photography on the same day is the best lah cheapest ah cheapest lah because you do makeup all that
oh okay so we do the nikah and the photography after that
paling senang dekat dalam hotel tu tak boleh gerak-gerak
mm ya dia nya swimming pool I ever went it looks nice lah so I think I need to ask the person on that day
three three err I think for for your case kan tiga jam macam okay ah very manageable
apa yang teething problems
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem aku outside mah but I can see people no space sit ya
pasal panas oh ya lah hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat err lawn tu mostly budak-budak parents semua tak pergi seh ah
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the nikah
for for my case okay lah terus settle
cause for for err the place I have right there's a stage jadi kalau kirakan okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the nikah start at eleven thirty
lagi-lagi kalau apa tu like what you said
betul juga tapi wedding memang ah orang macam panic kan jadi ada sikit problem sikit lah cuma apa tu
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my nikah so
nikah plus err tea ceremony ya
ya lah siapa nak ikut to the letter kan yes
okay cause I thought the nikah and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
kirakan I want to like macam eleven thirty to one for example is nikah tea ceremony and then
that's also the time kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar lah
okay tapi kalau COVID dia ada different kind of rules ah only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
err out of that twenty they have to be in their table oh but mungkin maybe masa tu policy belum start ah tapi I went to the Grand Mercure right and err
kalau ada COVID infection ah
okay I see but only worry like err yang table yang tak mingle boring ah duduk tengok each other makan cannot mix with the you know
kalau ah
pasal your wedding lain tau your wedding can mingle is a is different cause err your time can be taken ah you know speaking ah
simple simple hmm okay kalau ah
kalau if I
hmm okay okay oh I itu yang category macam err emcee ah yang macam too much lah that's why
I kena fikir juga pasal ni
that is one thing then ya baju you all buy the fabric then make at the joo chiat right
some more is if my date considered is during the syawal tau so have to do it early okay okay lagi apa lagi eh
pasal is it pasal melayu punya photographer oh oh ah
ya nasib baik dewi is not so
you ada kawan
yang boleh yang ada recommend recommend
for photography I tak tahu seh really I
oh ya pandai apa apa pose yes yes
kirakan macam know how to live up the atmosphere then ya
tapi the that time your punya photographer is the that guy is not that good
younger guy was good he was very err dia punya social skills good ah
ya tapi at least dia tahu I mean ya
okay ah terperanjat gue sial lah
err lepas the normal ambil gambar on the dais lepa stu after lunch or
cause I remember you ada macam speech eh tak ada eh so everything
tapi before the ending you all go around each table ambil gambar with everybody ah
okay jadi

and you're like okay dah settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
so that's why mourinho selalunya dia nya team err their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
klopp and mourinho ni macam dorang macam opposite sides of the spectrum ah in a way ah
apa swan eh swan swan and harry kane
sun sun ke swan
okay ya lah I mean it's like it's like championship manager ah right oh no no best is the best is like FIFA what am I saying okay okay sorry sorry aku dah lupa defence ni apa
how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone aku
okay lah takpe lah anyway ah I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing ah cause you know I've just uh
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so pada aku macam
I I like what Netflix does these days eh dorang ada macam ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
sial lah bro that one macam for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
kau zuleika zulkifli actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
tell all documentary ah an anelka and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything macam basically
aku rasa nama dia macam gitu ah I mean he's muslim name is supposedly bilal but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
like one was the the france punya
and macam pada anelka it was not fair ah like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
okay so so so basically macam I've watched cobra kai I've watched err I mean I don't tend to watch the series ah I would watch like documentaries or macam movies ah so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting ah
err social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now uh it's about how macam Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants kan dorang basically
dorang tahu like what attracts you what what you're interested in uh
so dorang buat macam uh and if not an avatar they like what do you call it lah
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like macam they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why macam Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
sia ah why do they think this way sia asal dorang fikir macam gitu like dia
kau how can people just support sia macam tak masuk akal but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya lah usually it's either very insidious thingy ah
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like macam lost his faith a bit lah cause one of the themes of the movie
after he has a son of his own he starts to macam go back to
like worshipping god ah no macam macam it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like macam ya lah orang beragama pun macam
kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu that sort of thing so macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang for like five years lepas tu dia macam eh astgahfirullah aku kena qadak balik solat aku
ya so so so that's a tragedy macam something happens and then after that he he has this macam love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like macam ah
you know that twilight fella lah huh ya the glittery vampire so dia yang sekarang
okay shouldn't stereotype err pastor dorang
okay lah so it's an lah it's not the Android box yang Android box yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada kan tu benda kan
no he was in house of cards and and err house of cards the final season just macam tergantung macam gitu apa
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang cause of all the
religious upbringing to say like eh ni benda salah sia what am I doing you know that sort of thing so macam I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no lah no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like macam it won't have been like once every few months ah which is the situation you find it you find now ah
dia panggil kau sir but asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau seh
check it out I I was wrong okay lah I mean I think I can tell this to the camera eh to the camera pula to the recorder okay I was from serangoon right
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like ini aizat adam ni semua like eh ya eh eh you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school dulu
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude lah but but macam
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many uh malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese lah macam you won't find a malay chap in the in that class ah
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times nanti aku google aku check kan lepas tu aku aku aku forward dekat kau lah
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that uh inhibits our society ah but basically ya lah back to what we were saying macam aku rasa that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference apa betul tak like
ya macam one thing about us mungkin err compared to kita punya parents eh macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita tend to macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita you know like our parents aku rasa dorangnya generations is like kau kenal ni satu perempuan
within a few months tunang another few months kahwin you know that sort of thing
what was that so so so you see eh macam what ondre said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different ah you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case ah macam like oh it was a norm ah like oh your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants ah you know so macam like
orang pakistan kat sini will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now ah so maybe kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa then talk talk talk eh I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing ah macam it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to ah but of course I mean
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that macam err syed ahmad was interested in your mother
um okay so what was that okay so basically macam ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing ah so macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir sia eh anak aku
I think girls these days they are like lagi beza dari kita macam in the sense that they are really pressured to
susceptible to this ah macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa in a way lah but aku rasa untuk wanita ni
dorang lebih senang dipengaruh ah pada aku ah ah like compared to guys ah macam I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife macam
ah kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah you know that sort of thinking you know
where they provide a place for you to do the walimah kan
a still somewhat rare for the whole majlis from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like masjid mawaddah
no but bartley is like macam bartley is is is so called not really
I'm trying to say is that macam nowadays you have instances where people do say like eh should we have our majlis in a mosque cause then like orang nak sembahyang and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like macam it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding what you know in a way lah but of course
pada aku pun aku rasa macam if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a walimah a small walimah outside the mosque ah
okay ah not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam that was
something that that was on her mind like macam eh why are we doing it in the mosque abeh macam like oh I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but pada aku macam like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
eh why you buying a three room flat sia it's so macam aku rasa macam I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure ah I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning ah
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way macam at the end of the day you just have to be
ya huh ya ya aku dah end of this month eh end of this month eh end of this year dah enam tahun
aku fikir aku nak upgrade to macam five room ke ah
sengkang juga
bro bro tampines mahal bro tampines mahal gila no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so tak ah tu abbas nya parents aku sengkang apa
basically basically okay basically basically sengkang right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale lah so for those people who don't know sengkang you know is divided into this so called macam four districts gitu lah so err anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this sungai lah
it's called the sungai punggol I think ah so like if you look out my window here you can see the sungai ah
so that sungai punggol err is the boundary between sengkang which is held by the workers' party and ang mo kio which is held by pinky work
you should talk to my cousin abbas ah who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me eh kalau kau suka breaking bad kau kena watch this better call saul lah
so aku macam aku ada tengok ah like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while aku macam how many seasons are there oh my god breaking bad only has five seasons
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where abang dia yang very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
okay I I think roughly around at that point aku dah macam
kan there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle dia macam terus didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya lah but he kept on macam like downplaying si jimmy nya achievement ah dia macam cakap you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing kan
and the witcher ke apa witcher witcher pun aku tak tengok sangat
eh prison break si dia tu dah mati kan the actual dah mati kan the guy who plays michael scofield lah
okay let me google this michael scofield mati
so is season five good or not dorang ada tulis prison break season six lagi tak ah
the movie was not on the ni ni kan the movie was on siapa eh only the final break
shucks ah ikram stop getting me hooked back on all this crap lah malas sial nak pergi tengok ni semua
oh my god stop sia kau
aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh once I see macam satu benda ni ada four five seasons kan
aku terus lemah ah aku macam no lah I cannot watch this sia
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass punya app
mine is after iPhone eight lah basically boleh ah so so so it's one of those things that I don't know ah Apple fan boys are talking about these days ah
double double tap then the code keluar
the scanner the scanner the scanner keluar not the code the camera thingy ya
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code ah macam ni kau tengok ayatul kursi

the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot lepak one corner it it doesn't feel like the lepak place ah it feels like you just go in kau beli makan dekat no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
okay ya good joke but ah so then macam apa tau dia macam tempat makan dia eh dia macam okay kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam queue up dekat the stall ah so it's like a hawker stall ah it's like a hawker centre
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like abeh kau kena pergi sana order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that makanan dia okay lah not bad lah but pada aku macam so so juga but it doesn't have the lepak feeling lah
because like pada aku lepak feeling macam kau kau duduk then like eh bhai teh tarik lagi satu ah eh if you want to go place you should go to mahamoodiya
yes the one next to the Shell eh dorang dah up market sia
then aku realise
mahal sia it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the apa last week of the year what
kan then aku tak tahu macam mana like we need to have more options I guess
but unless we go for the apa ah smaller rooms ah
that one untuk yang the suite room so aku rasa macam besar sangat I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
aku rasa boleh ah but I think it's about dalam empat ratus gitu
aku rasa ah
ya I think aku rasa for now empat orang but
the price confirm makin mahal
botanic gardens theme ah the boy bunga theme
oh ya dia belum decide right
prime is hard to find you know there's only like berapa jer dalam singapore ni tau nak cari
kipas oh it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know sebelah-sebelah leh like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
ya bodoh so big sia
ya so what is just the four of us ah xing jing oh no with the others right because we doing dinner dengan yang lain-lain kan malam so
kau plan lah then kau bilang kita then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
ya they bodoh
this is christmas so tak payah lohei
I think dinenr can go all out lah I guess not all out as in macam terus
apa sakan ah but more like a
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve lah I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the makanan will dia ada server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
he kena bullied
what what do you mean location kena change you mean the buffet town run away or what
for the dinner dia orang boleh eh
um terrence I haven't check with him yet tapi aku rasa maybe dia tak boleh because that week he's going back to school already
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least macam tujuh puluh percent untuk
dia orang go to phase three lah so
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members lah yang tinggal dalam serumah right
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas punya dinner kan
so aku tak tahu ah macam mana like
bo pian lah kan macam tak boleh apa
I mean technically it's not even a macam public holiday on that day right
I think he never go there before so you should be safe dia tak ada benchmark untuk tempat tu
then the next morning he will aku rasa go to the work straight
so the tuesday morning aku rasa he has to go back to work lor
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday punya time slot I mean err rates ya
masih ah kau taiwan
ya it was that one I go on march it was macam sejuk ah tapi macam just like aircon kind yes
the he say macam apa like
he's not going they are not going to macam vaccinate everybody kat singapore
tak tahu save duit agaknya
apa purpose kan I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat they can just spread to each other lah
oh cactus cactus yang kecil-kecil gitu eh then
dua cactus
no the normal cactus yang besar dia ada thorns then macam bulat-bulat gitu and dia punya shape
straight then bulat-bulat eh right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
kau siak ah hey mahal pokok tu
kau tanam pokok durian jer lah
the experts say lah the lockdown causes more macam apa problems than benefits ya
macam dulu dia tak pakai grab but sekali now oh I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it lah rather than kau tahu macam kalau tak ada COVID like everybody is still
macam oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay lah aku rasa
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money untuk
aku rasa okay lah
bagus lah kan macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef kat rumah kan semua buat dalgona coffee macam kau
you will just stuck at home with your family lah you got no choice but just to interact dengan dia orang like
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like kalau kau baca that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
then aku rasa like I think they dia orang tak concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
I mean during the even like dia punya apa
so they don't really care about that part aku tak tahu but
it just go without the track what sia bodoh
iya lah confirm ada lah
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then macam suddenly kau dalam hutan tu kau introduce monyet kau introduce pangolin kau introduce lemur pelanduk I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya ni bukan library tau kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil tau
so they have to kill or macam that one lah like what chicken flu like that eh bird flu chicken flu
sekali coronavirus from plants leh
kau masih tau
I only need to buy one plant untuk taruh dalam office aku
but actually mati a very terrible death to do
ya sia kau teruk sia
then we got scraping benda tu
aiya the typical kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu
dia macam coconut tree but it's not
what is it called eh yang
it's not coconut tree yang pokok-pokok yang
fern gitu is it look like a fern
tak lah serious
ya usually events that kind of pokok lah you know like those
standard pokok I don't know
it's the typical pokok at events you know
yes that's one thing pokok pisang
the youngest means macam early twenties twenty two ah wow I feel old now
cakap lah kau nak cakap dulu ke aku cakap dulu
eh abeh yang sulaiman tu
kau cakap apa dia ajak kau gi ubi eh gi pancing
but which part of pulau ubin kau pergi pancing
apa yang dekat jetty
is it the place that that time you saw me and my friend pancing
kampung melayu ada satu jer kan
then after that malam tu kau dapat ikan
kat hidung wah
aiya ya ya ya tu jer satu ikan potong steam
then lepas tu sulaiman jumpa kau kat sana ke dia jumpa kau kat singapore
then kau pancing from what time to what time
but you you go there with no intention of pancing ah
the place where you guys pancing was a a man made structure then but why he asked whether you want to stay there because when I air pasang all all around you semua
but if pasang betul you guys habis lah
sepuluh malam nine oh ya moon right
oh enjoy enjoy but then you guys got bring tempat duduk ah
backpack bikin tempat duduk
I go pancing actually pancing that time yang kau nampak aku tu dekat apa tempat dekat dengan office kau lah that time ah that one that one I don't remember we catch much lah but got one that's opposite apa crab island eh
ah pulau ketam that one we we caught like berapa enam enam ekor ikan bapa duri apa
is is middle of jahan eh johan
I know the biggest one is jahan tak ke ke ikan oh duri is the middle one lah
ya so it's what what's the small keli eh keli duri jahan
bukan johan johan nama orang
johan tu nama orang ini jahan ya
ah medium lah all the medium then no no jahans then um we caught one stingray ah small lah kecil ah uh then
I think we caught like what countless number of crabs lah we caught like twenty then the thing about the crab right we never bring apa yang kau campak tu ah we don't have bento and we don't have apa yang people usually throw
ah jaring I think it's called jaring ah net lah ah jala ah
tangkap pe
changi changi village we reach there pukul five plus six plus then masih lah we go buy chendol rilek pre-COVID last last year last year
then my friend ya si hanas hanas ah so he was like eh err I forgot what's the place ah but it's behind the that place lah that one that I told you just now ah pulau ketam belakang tu
tak lah he ah to the jetty the ah
taxi ya the taxi the best part is my friend already ask eh nak beli bento tak
then ah tak apa ah malas sangat bawa
then in the end we go there then because we got no bento no jala no what so in the end we use rod stand
rod stand the metal rod stand then we we just asar the tip make sure it's slightly sharper lah we go inside the water
we see we see we see one crab we whack so all the crabs right the twenty plus ah all got one lubang
all at least got one lubang one
think ketam bunga ah
wan one wan one dah tidur juga ah no you wan five I think then wan one wan okay wan one
he thirty plus wan tu baru kahwin wan three drive lorry eh err van van sorry wan four I never seen before
ah this wan one sleep han dah sleep then hakim tengah masak
err the behind the crab island lah ah pulau ubin he was there at pulau ubin then after that so I I told err hakim eh err nak nak tukar tu ah umpan because he's
then I ask him eh you don't want to open your rod campak umpan then he was like nanti ah tengok then I was like okay lah tak apa ah I go I go change my umpan
the the rest of them was doing their umpan on the left side so I went to their right side
then ambil ah udang hidup pegang lah benda tu goyang-goyang then tengah tengah dah dah dah
dah poke ah dah poke the udang
then dah campak dah campak dah rilek ah then I was like ya tengok it was it's a nice scenery lah then then I realised I I heard something on the right side then I was like itu apa tu then I I listen closely lah
then it was actually azan ah ah three
three azan I don't know azan buat lah terkejut I also don't know lah
ya three ah azan then I was like azan eh then because I look to the I look inside I look inside the forest then it was pitch dark
then I was like the only the only way this can be like real ah if there is a kampung beside lah
so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask nos eh nos beside yang tempat we pancing got kampung ah then tak ada lah then I was like
oh tak ada ah pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan
I heard ada macam ada orang tengah azan and I I stood there for quite some time lah just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly lah eh kau tak bilang ah
oh kau tak kejut aku then I was like apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ
so he was like um tertidur
then he tried to sleep you know ah he always try to sleep when he pancing one then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then dia pusing pusing pusing then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree lah kat tengah-tengah in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree lah then he saw one nenek one nenek
walk pass then he was like ah the nenek told him like cu cu dah tahu sini tempat keras kan asal malap jer di tempat you eh macam tempat you pula eh no no no not that
why why um malap jer tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight lah but that day he just never on it lah then
apa tu err macam this one is mystics lah like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
keep quiet then rilek-rilek then the nenek um turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that lah
then the driver say got one time he was passing by ah at night ah then he actually saw at the pokok there ada err pocong ah tengah
so it it means that like that nenek come to actually warn them that that place very malap then got other stuff also lah then that that nenek just go there to warn them lah like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice lah but it's just malam ya malam kena jaga-jaga ya
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this one is where the driver will drive eh drive then this is an open area di sini ada satu pokok in the middle
path ah actually the right path also can you will see pulut ketam in front of you that stretch like that ah towards the tip lah you can see the whole tip of pulau ketam
then your past few days macam mana your past few months ah ah the time the last
time I met you then you say you just berhenti kerja pe you just stop work
so apa you you apply mostly what type of apa industry
what phone call eh kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau english all the way eh have you never notice beginning
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the cerita so kau dah apply kerja habis semua tak dapat ah all all rejected you
sakit hati ah
surrounding have a few other masjid in the east
no lah I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background juga kan
you will need to come in and explain to them oh tak lah this the way the reason why I letak the moderator first then followed by the asatizah then followed by err fandi ahmad is because
um according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever uh I know that first kau kena letak the moderator first
why why why the moderator first pasal dia yang akan moderate everything then followed by the asatizah who are
no lah to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of macam situasi lah
ya that's why lah that's not like you said lah is tak professional lah
of course is the comic lah because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group akan dibawa naikkan to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that dalam kamu punya age group lah so it's better for you in that sense ah
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera dah berapa mahal then err the time you took to edit I actually
pernah I pernah help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge ah tentang video ah the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship lah then after that then apa tu the thing is
kenapa tak ada any background in Photoshop ke apa ke so nak edit tak tahu macam mana nak edit so I ask you for help that time
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was tak susah because tak banyak animation tak banyak at that time lah it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence itu pun dah boleh jadi gila
then ya I understand because as a programmer nanti I do some programs ke apa and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti eh hakim um actually the client tak suka uh this part of the game ah can change it then dalam hati aku macam what it took me hours to get that part working
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research tengok whether apa tu apa yang client tu nak is feasible tak can it be included
into the program itself macam the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so oh sakit
true story actually sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap
no lah is is just pelik lah
dah start merepek
you know the back to the story sikit right just now I talk about my intern so my intern kan I was being paid err one thousand dollars
eh rilek ah rilek ah dengar dulu but but the thing is the time err I'm from
so bila kita um want to sign up for apa tu for internship you need to go through this website ah I forgot what's the website oh my apa website dia ah
ada lah website tu ada ada lah masih situ ah
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to gaji so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over ah fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through gaji like which one is higher pay lah
then I went in then I went in rilek-rilek talk with my colleagues then got other interns juga situ they are leaving already
then I was like eh your gaji berapa ah how much kau dapat every month one thousand huh eh one thousand sikitnya
wah sikitnya one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like oh according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know lah but
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like apa hal ni
malas you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay ah once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay lah rezeki di mana-mana
no you will say can boleh macam mana oh you need to sign up this you need to do that ah tak apa
Grab lah last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see macam dia punya timeline ah like what do you
kau cakap kau nak kerja Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo oh betul eh jauh
if you if you hustle even more macam hustle demi hustle jer is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
if you really can't get anything because apa tu okay lah I got learn some finance also lah kan you should know lah so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in lah rather than just duit terkeluar duit terkeluar then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the rezeki belum masuk lagi in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering dulu lah then while delivering then you can because when you do part time
take off like okay ah pukul sebelas sebelas sampai pukul empat ah I want to do delivery I got nothing much to do so it's it's quite a good
from your house sini jalan kaki punggol sengkang further eh macritchie further
mana seh
kenapa tu kenapa ada kick tu how long
dulu twenty four click take so long
macam might as well lah I park my motor somewhere
ah cerita cerita apa ah yang the worst witch
it's about this uh kid lah abeh dia ada power but then dia dia macam harry potter tapi it's about females it's witches
quite fun lah to pass time pasal sekarang aku dah tak kerja apa abeh tengah tunggu cari kerja kan so I just watch like whatever I can find lah on netflix then that popped out so I watch it it's not bad got four seasons and each episode macam empat puluh minit gitu
tapi dia orang pun baru pe so that kind of standard pe
abeh sekarang kau masih bayar untuk netflix
berbulan-bulan ya berapa ah dia orang naik harga kan
banyak benda sia naik harga my google drive also naik harga
I haven't seen any updates on it but I know google dah ada
assignment apa sia
I mean it will get better lah I mean yang COVID ni semua bukan like forever what they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better tak tahu ah
tengok ah
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on cari kerja ke start business ke
kau nak buat business apa sia
but ada juga ah macam sikit
abeh kau masih beli benda kat habbo
mm masih spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like jual your benda and quit or
banyak sangat benda kan
not like what if it gets worst macam like dia orang remove banyak benda from the game then orang semua macam tak nak main
I think dia orang macam tak fikir they gonna cause
macam like to them at the end of the day kita like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
macam like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then orang masih beli pe it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
habis smite apa jadi
oh really cause I know that day uh siapa naim asked uh ilyas to join but then ilyas said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
mm four days ago three days ago ya macam
the file got too big for ilyas so like dia tak boleh download then sampai dia have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why ah ilyas dia cakap dengan aku like oh I cannot play with you cause sekarang dia main among us jer
I think baru ah like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but dia cakap dia delete semua benda tinggal yang programme files
like dia basically formatted his ya
dia cakap dulu file dia macam fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu
cause that time dia cakap dia punya app ada issue lah he couldn't log in so dia delete then bila dia nak redownload balik tak boleh
so dia format like remove everything from dia punya lepas tu semua benda like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
that'll be cool though can you imagine yang character character dia semua jadi spongebob punya character macam mister crab sandy
probably go with good looks but I mean pasal kalau
badan sapau pun I mean you can just go to the gym boleh pergi gym boleh pergi like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that tapi kalau nak muka baru I mean you can't really do that also what so probably good looks
ya I guess banyak banyak duit at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like kalau nak like make yourself fitter and stuff boleh pergi lari and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
I mean to a certain extent semua orang pun macam at least a bit ah
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff lah kalau tak then there's really like no point
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but kalau
kalau ni hari not much lah I'm just going to go home and like rest but like kalau esok maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang haven't dah lama belum potong rambut so maybe I shall do that
rasa macam free kan
sekarang muka macam maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short macam medium length gitu lah tak nak panjang sangat pun
kalau kat rumah hmm
netflix lepas tu
main and playing a bit of
apa lagi ah
uh no I haven't played cause like I don't know macam
main dengan naim and muhammad they very competitive and then like if ilyas is not there like can't really
so I usually kalau dia orang dua jer then I I avoid
but like kalau the rest main then aku main ah cause I
I mean the same thing happened bila that time I tried to download kat my macbook apa
cause I don't think they have a punya file
oh ya kalau satu benda dapat rumah ah
I mean kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah then at most kau kerja untuk
maybe your savings and then like sikit untuk makan minum bills
we move to an island yang tak ada orang
uh pergi ah
so what the cow is the hantu or like
maybe orang maybe like someone like dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa
the latest the one I think just got removed what the kampung
I don't know buangkok some some no as in like an actual kampung macam
uh orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu ya
yang that time I went there untuk yang satu filming for this
cerita hantu ah
ya went there and then dia orang cakap uh tempat tu memang ada benda ah like there's there's actual hantu living there ya
and then like there's this one makcik ah like this chinese auntie
abeh dia orang cakap macam um like kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam have like
good intentions like you can't be there to macam
she said like kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur lah just let it be
we film from I think like we arrived there at six ah so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the hantu was late
and then we had to delay and then wait then um when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her punya costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the hantu it was quite quite interesting to see her change ah cause
dia ah she's like I think some
abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu and then it's kind of fun lah but macam
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal yang kecil punya contact lenses it's a full eye one
we were kind of worried lah that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god lah like nasib ah
benda tu jadi so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary ah to see her in the dark
ya lah but then it's the only kampung I know that exists in singapore lah
that kampung
they are very nice and then the when we were there kita nampak macam uh tiga caucasian people ang moh like white people
they were like dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok ah then dia orang nampak then kita punya filming punya benda then dia macam oh what you're doing
they like oh okay cool cool and jalan
quite a few like um there's a lot of kampung houses lah but macam maybe ada lima ke enam orang jer tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang ah
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that kampung
so macam she does the upkeeping and stuff ah and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
like ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
ya it's very close it's like macam kalau
dia like here and then it's just kat bawah
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the kampung area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
besar juga ah like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks gitu
it's all kayu and then like very old school lah semua macam
stay in the kampung
ya it's quite gelap I mean there there is a few street lights ah like around the area but it's quite dark and then um
tempat dia memang besar like really quite big ya
like explore like one small corner of it cause bila kita masuk kita naik lorry kena bawa semua equipment kan so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
aku datang just tengok-tengok abeh like macam tolong sini tolong sana
ya dah pukul lapan gitu then she came over
then she was like kau orang nampak apa-apa tak and I'm like um no and then she said like kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut nothing one
dia hantu baik then I'm like okay
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will tunggu malam baru keluar cause panas sangat like everyday it's so humid and hot
tiga tahun eh it's quite recent sia
but like kesian juga ah like you when you tengok the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
I want go yang tempat apa tu yang dekat gardens by the bay ah
pergi satu kali ah when in maybe secondary school
tiga wish
oo okay lah kalau dia orang nak kasih free ambil jer lah kalau kalau bayar then okay ah aku bingit but then kalau free
then collect dekat dekat rumah aku okay lah and
I mean ya memang ah like buang masa juga cause
they tell you like oh you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing abeh it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
but I don't think macam
kat bawah block
huh sini takde banyak kucing
only got lembu
have you seen your cat luar
seram sia
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad lah macam
hmm bila like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
abeh batuk rabak sia it's like cannot breathe and stuff
sekarang if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy ah like if he comes too close like my face
and then kalau when I mandi him like
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to macam pursue technology
the president speaks in malay kau orang semua stop it eh
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi I just I just want to give you a warning eh kau stop jer eh jangan buat lagi tau

 semua boys
ah  macam planning bar goal lah ni
 macam my cousin
four kids  juga so what happened was uh for them the first three
like just before university lah then  dorang pun happy happy kan yay dah  boleh semi retire
hurrah hurrah kan  mane kita nak pergi let's travel around the world
uh  macam gitu lah  kalau birthday  ni selalu we always tell people that you know ah really ah even when the adults celebrate the birthday kan frankly speaking alamak you know is really ah for the kids you know
it is really for them  pasal macam they really get into it you know  nanti kan uh  bila you tell them eh no need lah anything lah
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like oh must put this must put that oh must sing put the candle ah  semua ni kan all them ah
 ini topic eh I tell you eh I think every young adult ah will know this topic very well
kan kan  kita selalu gaduh kan
I think it's more frequent than that kan if only it was only every weekend you know  pasal every weekend kan is when you actually see tau
 kalau you  tak nampak in the week  pun kan  nanti dorang stealth tactic you know uh  behind your back ah eh  selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
ah and they will uh how shall I put this ah they don't even get defensive when you tell them eh how come ah when I was  kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
no kids uh but I was uh raising  itu my nephews my nieces kan from the time they were young lah um partly because for err me err usually lah I'm not around in singapore  pasal
I was studying away kan abroad then after that when I was working also um I was living abroad most of the time  pasal kena posting
so  selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my  apa abang or adik already  duduk kat rumah lah  jaga
my  mak kan pasal my  apa parents my late father dengan my mak my mak masih ada lah tapi my father dah  arwah so I moved them into my place lah so when I'm home in singapore ah I jaga all my anak sedara lah
err  dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa err foreign service
ah  jadi macam err
 lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say eh you go ah ah then you go lah so to be honest lah I spent most of my uh youth away  pasal belajar kan you know away in university
then I come back  pun
out of the country the thing is  ye lah kan people always say eh but you come back what you know what's the big deal but I said ya but people usually travel I don't travel I live away
that ah that the big different lah  pasal most people kan  macam business especially you go in go out  keluar masuk lepas tu  ye lah  paling-paling maybe  seminggu you know
 semalam
 ini biasa lah
 tapi apart from  macam bonus  macam grade kan I mean  takde apa-apa macam incentive  ke or
uh is just to put ah  betul lah
ya actually ah your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend lah  pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu kan one of my friend so he was
uh like you accountant also err so actually  yang hantar dia so went to  belajar lepas how many years ah three years ya three years  lepas tu balik lah  balik then of course serve the bond lah
serve the bond buat accounting kan and like you lah also quite good at it  dia punya bond  berapa eh  enam tahun masa tu
not too bad  pasal pun for them  dorang habiskan  dulu baru pergi unlike me lah  pasal for me kan disrupt uh
then ah then  pergi luar lepas tu ah  balik you see so
err  ye lah for
for me a bit different so  lepas tu my friend  balik as usual lah  kita kan
you know especially when  biasa lah kan  ada baby then baby shower
 lepas tu keep up  lepas tu kaya-kaya then  macam every  dua tiga bulan you know eh fed up lah let's go have  teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue kan suddenly he said
you know I thought very good what no  ye lah but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short  apa dia jadi nursing officer
ah  dekat hospital
until today ah  pulak sekarang COVID kan ah  pulak dia tan tock seng
ah wah high demand  bukan more in demand high demand  sekarang mengeluh aja lah so he saw already like alamak  kene shift work  lepas tu tengok sape foreign worker everyday kan
err I think that's just tip of the iceberg lah  pasal masa period gini kan  kena buat banyak lah I think the most important yang  dorang kena buat triage  macam
 semua bila datang tu kan ah  nanti is uh people like my friend and his team lah then they check and then they ask them eh you look familiar ah because after a while ah
they keep coming back  tahu because now they know what to do like oh my back pain uh  dapat oh I feeling
kan  pasal when you tell them ugh my chest ugh cannot breath sir ugh ugh ugh ah then you cannot take the risk kan
so my friend after a while wah  boleh kenal muka tahu
I mean that one for sure lah it must be twenty four hours  pasal you just never know when this virus will strike kan ah so  sebab itu susah eh for your job  yang last time  tu so you say you cover asia pac  selalunye which countries ah
ah see I'm older than you kan so  tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk lah so I covered all fifty-four african countries
 pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know ah and then djibouti  pasal starts with a D D J
so I tell eh A to Z know you think what ah fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that one wasn't posting lah that one  macam
you know  dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then after one month eh you go back there again then you go to you know um  macam namibia then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
kan um  macam gitu ah but back then ah
ah you cannot stay too long lah  pasal
so from that time ah you know  sampai ke malam ah then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work kan
so ah it's fun ah especially when you're twenty something kan  penat pun penat lah of course but you know it's fun get to see the world ah by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone ah I'm different era
you must understand ah so much harder I mean  dulu
then uh you cannot find uh where you're going  mana ada Google map Google Earth  ni semua right so wah everyone  cakap eh
and I always tell people ya you all ah think now life so mafan ah  susah lah  ini lah  itu lah  leceh lah you know but imagine my time I told them started work ah no laptop is this thing called ah desktop
oh when they  itu ambil lah kan
nah I I've been uh using until today  cuma sekarang supplement uh  gunakan Netflix kan  gunakan you know Rakuten View
ah banyak lagi lah sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two ah  macam macam dah  tak worth it  gitu lah kan  pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
 budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus eh
I went through that whole  apa uh how shall I put this ah I went through that whole cycle ah kan that whole cycle ah
twinx the magical fairy  ini semua kan that that was I went through the whole cycle
kan then you have to be always referee kan  nanti uh  yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband  lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else  abang ah then you have to be referee kan then when the cousin  semua datang ha  lagi lah kalang kabut
on uh handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them kalau nak tengok semua share okay
ah  macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right  macam mana pun kan I mean cannot lah you know when ipad first started kan I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put kan  dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
 macam kenapa lah you know maybe lah you call me jurassic eh  pasal I'm conservative about this thing kan  macam huh why is your baby looking at Youtube lah and this and that kan to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry  pasal dia punya lung
get exercise  tahu
 cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor lah you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying  pasal babies are
father of four kan you  tahu lah kan  budak-budak ni semua  bila nangis then you  kasi attention  sikit aja semua okay
exactly exactly ah  sama lah
no  pasal you  pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family  keluar kan
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point ah oh my friends  semua marah if I
say things like that you know ah  kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so  macam no lah you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures what
kenapa I don't tak faham apa-apa you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids ah
said  biasa lah
eh let's face it lah you know even we as teenagers ah last time kan remember when your mother  tanya score  macam mana ah okay lah
lost your homework  kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
ah tease out kan bit by bit and find out  semua kan all these kinds of things lah
no I think until you basically die I always remind people  pun kan you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them ah you are still ah
people over and over again lah kan  pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off  macam even  lepas I  hantar last time lah eh my  anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
although  ada maid ada  dia punya you know grandmother  kat rumah kan
but I don't think it's it's just you I think uh there are still a small but good number of people yang macam you and that's good  tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about  setahun gitu for one
you know take some time talk to them kan  tanya-tanya macam mana kan then you realize actually they are quite neglected
mm  tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know  macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them  macam manja-manja dengan teacher  pasal macam
dah lah  every day pergi sekolah kan and even during COVID and home based learning kan they see the teacher still online kan  pasal
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two kan wah  budak-budak semua balik sekolah kan
no more home based learning for many schools kan wah most parents hurrah hurrah  pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out wah
 betul kan
 ni macam shift work kan follow the time zone so tell the kids okay ah  tidur eh
ah  betul
or you can travel a bit lah take one day off to maybe  beli-beli barang boleh beli present kan
mm  beli present kan ah
especially if nearer to the school holiday  ke kan
 musim apa musim sejuk
you're lucky if is brown lah  selalunye kan is more like like greyish black  tahu
and then the other thing is I call it slushy  pasal is really that  macam yang that seven eleven  punya slushy you know the Slurpee ah kan  pasal it's
ah the colour of course Slurpee  lebih sedap lah you know
when you walk around kita kan  tak biasa pakai waterproof boots and this and that
and that's the thing I I don't like about that lah  tapi london during that period also nice lah  pasal christmas ah
wah  pergi london bridge
 empat-empat
 kenapa tak pergi itu euro Disney
wah ni mesti makan chocolate ah
 ni nak tengok that little statue of that little boy peeing lah kan
 tengok bola lah wah
correct  sebelum Grab lah mm
ah  itu lah
 tapi dapat tangkap glamour ah
 dia bayar itu lah family ah
your  kawan jadi super sub ah
ah kan  ada
for me last time I would go to manchester  macam a few couple of months I go up  pasal I was studying kan that time
oh  lepas tu nanti one of
not one ah couple of my friends  semua gila bola juga
then  dorang ada that time uh subscription ah
 macam membership you know so but the good thing is being asian  dorang semua mana macam muka kita
so we go and we go  bukan uh division one  aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for  yang macam
 pasal takde big name  takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
mm mm mm I was posted to paris  tapi from paris I also cover uh three other countries lah I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so  empat
country lah  yang kena jaga so for me ah when people come usual lah you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget ah I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
ah  pasal
and  kalau pergi london  tu just outside  selalu ni all this uh
housewives all these  makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
ah  dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world lah so wah shiok you know so I was in paris uh two zero four to eight so  empat tahun ah  kat situ
 nanti nampak yang that  lampu tu lah kan  dia macam lighthouse kan every night ah ah so I'll see that light lah
eh  penat juga budak-budak
 naik stroller lah two of them
actually gare du nord when you  keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal  banyak kebab  banyak yang maghrebian  nya kan  yang daripada morocco  daripada daripada mana eh uh
ah  ada dua option satu you just  naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down  pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's  macam symbol lah paris kan so  bila
 bukan sabotage  bukan ada terrorism
 sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat  ni semua dorang touring kan it's really really
ya and I do miss uh living there  pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world lah you know without a doubt lah you know
paris eh  memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london  macam K lah you can walk a bit a bit lah  tapi after a while  macam
ah boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and  macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery kan
 kena tengok bawah lah  pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni kan
they got lah  nanti after COVID
after COVID even for me  pun frankly lah eh  lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore lah  pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly  dekat singapore lah
 tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice lah  pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my  mak kan seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend ah  masuk johor lah
mm and also  pun aiya you know  boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids kan like I've got even uh grand nephews grand nieces kan  yang dekat malaysia then its easy to uh go to
Legoland kan  pergi makan-makan
only be able to travel kan pergi johor and whatever  sebelum kita boleh really go out there again lah
know  dekat-dekat lah you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know um  pasal every day before COVID kan between two hundred to three hundred thousand eh  dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu kan  bukannye satu dua ribu kan
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right  pasal apa dia punya
 penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
obviously lah but also don't forget catered also for the johorians who work here  pasal
as soon as you hire one kan then  dorang buka kan payroll payroll  nye tu ah so  dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
ah  dia by two kan when you go there  sekarang some shops lah they definitely accept Nets which is good lah you know
 pasal even for their workers kan  lepas tu balik malaysia lah  nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up kan nak tukar duit
kan when their salary is already in sing dollars so  dorang alah pakai Nets aje lah  lebih senang
 tak susah
but you can tell ah  macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites kan  yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town  betul lah
is really bad  macam city square tu kan
um  orang semua tengok wah really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully lah it'll be a slow and painful process lah but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not  macam kita aje kan you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so  macam gitu aje lah
ah that's always good question  tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me  macam each one is so different kan so
you know ya  pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know lah budget pun  bukannye banyak kan even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type  macam
you know you just  ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know  macam you  tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you  tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of  teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did lah you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd  lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends kan ah so for me that's where it's quite you know
but I must say um not so much now lah but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me  pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest  yang dorang  baru jer  buka kan err
 orang asing you know so was a lot of fun lah you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
orang melayu ah or like someone who belajar melayu
you rasa
to improve dorang punya
yes belum keluar
oh kat yang bedok is it tanah merah
apa tu err
and I got like three days off you know how I told you macam I
sepuluh hari lagi left
slowly slowly ah slowly gila
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths uh they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit macam
ah macam gitu lah ya
but apa tu
the apa tu the
kurang ajar seh kurang ajar gila
it's not it's tak compulsory tapi macam
eh asal you tak baca dulu sebelum you buat paper
okay I think that was me in in apa tu in
secondary school also when kita buat lit
okay jap
speedy ni
speedy tak tahu lah
dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini tau like everytime dia
everytime kita nak everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
okay lah okay lah tak cukup attention
tak cukup apa tak cukup attention kesian dia
but apa tu
so dia baru join
because there was this other person but he selalu
ya it was quite rabak uh
err apa tu err
ya lah abeh nak mandi semua
so anyway he told me that lah he told me macam
so macam he was damn lost ah
my language classes then dia macam
dia macam tak cakap apa-apa never say anything so aku macam okay
ya so it's a bit macam give me some heads up uh
tu lah
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot paksa orang to
datang and you know
and then macam it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I have to really plan macam straight away after finish
pastu keluar lepak and then go straight to work atau sleep a bit more and
tidur jer kerja
ya and because my shift pukul berapa pukul tiga
no takde takde takde
no they dorang big fans of macam the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill uh actually
tu lah maksud dia
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything ah because it's a totally lain punya client ya
ya she she took chemistry in the pastu um
that I've been very complacent macam I've
not complacent macam terlalu banyak
err oh yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok the the deadline and all that
abeh kita proofreading we put everything ah like whether the date is correct
the numbering and all that and the oh categorisation and all that is betul
macam whether they
whether they apa tu
volunteer because kita punya kerja kan banyak ada nak kena chope
macam you must chope certain deliverables lah
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of macam mana kita kerja
okay so pukul tiga setengah I bangun
let's say pukul lima we have to send headlines
because I'm the kind of person yang I cannot tunggu for people
like I'm not a apa tu
that was last time uh remember I told you there was like one time in between july sampai
september ke august
just jaded like macam
so dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat
orang ketiga lah
apa benda home wrecker
no I think dorang nak more natural conversation so that
I know lah but macam we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
I don't know takut it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kesian seh
ya what have you been watching lately cerita
good tak it looks like very old
berapa episode berapa season
satu jer ada
okay bagus
ya it's so sad uh banyak
banyak but
shows nak kena
either like postpone their dorang punya release because of COVID
bila dia when is it supposed to be
ya same as apa tu yang mugen train also what it was released quite super damn early in apa tu
in japan lepas tu like only came in singapore berapa bulan jer nanti
ya macam
not transfer macam how they send over copies to
macam but what what cloud can carry that then how we have google drive
ya I'm I'm so interested in that macam I think that's what
to datang in like in a dalam ada bawa briefcase
wait so back then actually dah ada
err apa tu portrait on
ah nak kasi nanti lah sekejap lagi
ya twenty more minutes sayang
speedy nak say something
okay tunggu kejap jer just now I give you food you don't want to take
pastu macam gini ah how how how anyhow like that can ah
tak don't breathe on the thing
ya macam
apa tu err different types of
jap eh do you want anything from pasir ris
tak nak my brother can get Gong Cha you want
ya macam
then macam
I don't know lah there could be those directors yang very macam oh I need this shot
I need this shot it needs to be this particular way you know macam
ya what what kind of movie would you film melayu
would it be more macam
embodies that the most yang paling
paling like paling dekat show that the kind of movie that you like
okay more prominent ones yang kita tengok Handmaiden tu was it good
mm macam the food change eh food chain
wah takde movies what movies is
you know what I mean like you it makes you think macam oh my god whoa
but like you know when he went through the apa tu
kan ada I don't know whether the lady or the man yang cakap
if dia go through the door
did we watch another movie together about the the cerita indonesia
yang ugh was I with you
it was this cerita pasal
who had to balik to balik kampung sebab
dia nak reconnect dengan family dia ke apa
ke oh dia nak dia nak cari
remember yang dia hang baju pastu
cerita apa eh
yes yes yes that one yang tu yang tu
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like uh tanya or ask anyone I don't know
but this kind of thing definitely need macam to set up to set aside like at least
oh yes you're right you're right betul betul betul
betul betuls okay lah
cute gila oh my god it's very cute
ya ya I dah wash lagi I dah basuh
I dah kering
I dah apa lagi err vocabulary boleh kasi dorang
I kering I dah squeeze dry
I dah compress tu jer
ya I dah I've done quite a lot of things lah
ya so as in it's drying now tengah nak kering I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
bawa balik ah mana satu yang you nak
because it all looks so pretty semua lawa gila
dia macam those who know will know right
and then people think like err this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai jer
ya we've talked about this before berbual
like you know how when it when it's macam when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
dia macam it feels a bit cheaper because like
oh now they are going more mainstream lebih mainstream
popularity of macam demon slayer for example
not as popular of course lah but macam ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise nak beli nak beli apa lagi
ya macam these merchandise nak beli baju you know
ya lah but macam if you if it were another show for example macam Fruits Basket
atau I don't know what's another show I don't hear it err hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular eh macam you know what I mean
well known so macam that's why I say there's pros and cons ah
you tahu kan I ada classmate jepun in my korean class
so dia
so macam most of us kita ambil sebab kita either
kita tengok cerita K drama dengar lagu K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so I asked her like oh how about ya so I asked her macam
and she say macam
macam real people
the life in japan macam how was her school life or like at least lah
she's quite nice lah then she shared with me like about her school life uh how dia kerja part time
quite interesting ah it's it's I love this class because macam
and like the eleven year old punya remember I berbual pasal
cute gila
ya because like I like I talk to her about macam my trip to yogyakarta the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also macam in jakarta and how dia rindu lah rindu gila dengan jakarta tapi she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place paling
tak kat yishun not at yishun
and then um dia macam I don't know
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to um calculate lah because dorang punya numbering is very susah gila it's like
dorang count kan dorang punya currency besar gila kan
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia sama juga
so nak kena you must really calculate lah
banyak fikir ah I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
exactly but macam
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to layan my korean I feel like I'm such a
lawa gila it's very it's super damn it's super nice

ah kau masih ada kan so aku akan buat macam ni lah tapi bila kau dah takde aku terpaksa cari plan B kan takkan aku macam gitu kan kalau tak ada apa-apa betul tak
mungkin waktu rehat aku lah lunch aku satu jam tutup mata no choice ah jadi jadi aku perhatikan kau tahu pasal aku rasa hidup aku ni macam kosong
kosong sebab kau tidak takde seorang wanita yang boleh memberikan aku kekuatan macam kau tahu macam partnership macam mana
aku terus cakap dengan kau lah eh
tadi kalau kau pernah pergi kat one north kan kau akan terlihat seorang perempuan gempal tau kau pernah nampak tak
siapa eh mesti kau pernah nampak dia kirakan uh yang temperature screener dekat sebelah one north security kan
iya lah kat luar station tu lah so sekali hari aku dah pernah jumpa dia tapi dia ni pula kelakar ah cakap dari sini eh dia masih bersuami
ada anak dua tinggal dengan suami tapi dia ada matair lain kat luar matair dia pula dalam case kau faham jadi aku nak kenal-kenal dengan dia pun macam mana ni
suami lain matair lain abeh aku ni siapa ah cina buta jadi aku cakap ah tak payah lah aku korbankan sensasi bontot dia kan aku korbankan aku punya niat
aku tak nak teruskan tapi aku nak tegur dia dia takda aku rasa dia dah tak tahu entah resign ke apa tapi budaknya baik abeh aku rasa umur dia tiga puluh dua tahun
K kita punya segment macam segment segment apa segment rumah tangga pula eh kau ni jauh-jauh seh dari kau punya line
jadi sekali hari tu aku balik naik sampai ke choa chu kang lot one K hujan lebat aku ikut dia babe dari jauh sebab aku kirakan macam dah buang tebiat kan jadi
pada ketika tu aku nampak dia bawa barang banyak tau lepas tu dia belanja tu bulan puasa babe bulan puasa recently
dia nak balik dari dia punya lot one nak naik bus kan lepas tu aku nak ikut dia sekali aku aku tak dapat cari dia punya jejak lah dia hilang tanpa jejak
kemudian hilang jejak dia pun um the next day aku jumpa lagi aku ikut lagi ah this time aku beranikan diri aku approach dia tak silap aku that time oh okay
aku approach dia aku tanya nombor telefon dia ketika dia tengah temperature screening so aku rasa a few days later berapa hari yang lalu
the next day aku jumpa dia ah aku minta tanya dia lah nombor telefon dia lah eh
dia perasan aku bilang dia aku bilang apa yang terjadi lah aku bilang dia saya ikut awak gini gini beberapa hari yang lalu dia bodoh bodoh ingat aku ni macam psycho takde lah niat saya nak kawan-kawan jer takde apa-apa
so lepas tu aku tak kenal sangat pasal dia kita pun jumpa ah ajak keluar makan ah
keluar makan pastamania itu kira bila bulan puasa lah jadi aku tengok dia
so far okay ah tinggal dekat choa chu kang anak dua tapi dia kasih tahu aku status dia ah
so suami dia kirakan okay lah cakap cakap kira cakap pendek kirakan
bawa perempuan tu datang rumah kat atas katil dia kan dua dua terancang lah dia dapat tangkap she came back jadi
dia benar-benar rasa marah kan so aku tak tahu apa terjadi
tapi dia kata demi untuk anak-anak dia masih simpan perkahwinan dia tapi pada masa yang sama dia jumpa satu abang grab ni lah dia naik grab kan dia jumpa satu abang bawa grab ni kan abang tu pula pun kat dalam case nak ceraikan bini dia
jadi masing-masing mungkin dalam situasi yang sama jadi masing-masing pun kantoi mungkin uh masing-masing berpacaran ah for the past like seven eight months sebelum aku nak masuk dalam picture
tapi kalau aku kaji kembali aku lihat eh
aku rasa tak boleh kan sebab apa ni uh complicated kan betul tak
kalau aku nak jumpa dia sekali pun nanti aku pun rasa tak sedap eh kalau aku kalau aku ajak dia keluar ajak makan mungkin aku belikan dia barang ke apa ah kau rasa sesuai ke dia dia masih bekas bini orang
abeh lepas satu matair orang aku ni siapa cinta buta takkan tiga orang dengan satu takkan nak takkan nak gang bang pula tak boleh babe takkan tiga dengan satu boleh gang bang
tak boleh jadi aku rasa macam alamak tak kisah lah kasih dia lepas ah betul tak
aku dah stop jadi apa yang aku buat aku punya cara simple aku delete aku hilangkan padamkan nombor telefon beliau aku hilangkan aku ah buang segala
record record ataupun ah history eh
aku punya message message conversation dan juga eh so that's it so aku tak payah apa-apa ingat ingat lagi
so lepas tu dia pun tak message aku aku pun tak message dia jadi kita pun buat macam takde macam buat bodoh lah faham
aku dah lama tak contact dia jadi dah dekat dalam dua satu minggu lebih dua minggu jadi aku ingat dia masih kat sana tapi ni hari tak nampak
mungkin dia dah pergi tempat lain mungkin dah resign tau tapi kerja dia ni macam ada contract kau tahu macam dia datang kerja dia tu
five and a half days kan ambil temperature sahaja kau faham tapi aku bilang sama dia awak kenapa tak nak cari macam kerja permanent macam cari kerja kau faham macam admin kan so dia bilang aku dia nak ambil security course
aku bilang dia security course aku bilang dia lah dua belas jam tau you awak nak ambil security awak punya anak-anak macam mana aku bilang dia lah kan saya rasa lebih baik awak fikir dua tiga kali lah saya bilang sebab kalau awak kirakan awak dia suka buat event
ah so dia suka macam jual-jual barang kau tahu macam flea market dia suka macam organise tempat flea market jual barang she likes to organise things ah jadi pendek kata dia ni baik orangnya
cuma aku rasa tak payah lah aku teruskan niat aku kan sebab dia satu bini orang
aku tak ada besarkan nafsu babe kalau satu hari lelaki dia dapat tahu eh
telefon aku sorry eh itu siti eh saya nama saya manap saya ni suami nya si
perempuan ni lah eh
eh kau kenapa kau tak ada perempuan lain nak cari eh this thing akan terjadi tau kita tak tahu apa yes walaupun lelaki dia main tiga sekali pun tidak bermakna yang aku boleh kacau bini dia
sebab dia masih satu bini orang masih tinggal bersama lagi satu bumbung tau betul tak
jadi aku rasa tak payah lah aku teruskan jadi kalau dia nak bermatair dengan budak tu yang matair grab dia tu ah itu pandai-pandai dia orang lah kan kalau dia orang kena tangkap dia kena kena kena tanya dia jawab kau faham aku tak nak
ah betul tak itu aku punya cerita
iya lah sebab ni pun datang asal nafsu buat apa kalau kau nak jumpa seseorang tu apa sebabnya kau nak kenal perempuan tu agama dia ke kecantikan beliau ke
kerja beliau ke harta ke kau tahu aku pula dalam case nanti aku cakap dengan bini aku very simple aku berdoa kepada allah subhannallah wa taala kalau benar benar
bini orang isteri aku yang cina ni sanggup berubah untuk aku dia sanggup convert agama huh aku bersama dia lapan tahun berumahtangga tak ada anak dia bayar segala-gala untuk aku aku terus cakap dengan kau untuk pengetahuan kau lah kasih kau
aku tinggal dekat rumah dia dekat condominium kan kat telok kurau tu pun kan eh duduk semua dia bayar
duit rumah dia bayar duit tong sampah dia bayar even macam dulu aku bawa kereta kan sometimes lah bulanan punya deposit pun dia bayar tau kereta tau
dulu aku bawa kereta kan mitsubishi dengan aku bawa C class kan jadi dia banyak membantu aku dari segi kewangan dulu aku pernah ada loan dulu aku pernah
ah apa ni ambil loan sampai sini tau dulu-dulu lah dia bayarkan aku punya hutang dia banyak berkorban wang ringgit untuk aku
tapi aku terbuat silap aku terkenal-kenal aku aku terkenal kenalan dengan satu seorang aku aku bilang kau kan
yang perempuan tu yang celaka tu kan jadi aku bilang diri aku kenapa allah bagi aku ujian besar jadi aku bilang dia okay lah untuk aku menghilangkan segala-gala aku punya keperitan aku malam aku kerja aku lupakan si pinoy tu
aku ada harapan kan siapa tahu nanti next counselling session mungkin beliau dapat berikan aku peluang kedua aku tak tahu lah kan kalau itu terjadi aku akan berubah kau akan lihat aku tak macam sekarang
aku rasa sukar tapi aku tidak menafikan segalanya terserah kepada allah taala jadi kalau benar-benar terbuka hati dia tiba-tiba mungkin dia nak kasih aku peluang aku akan pastikan
ini benar-benar berlaku lah aku rasa sukar tapi pada masa sama walupun sukar aku dah buat keputusan kalau katakan lah aku ditakdirkan bercerai kali kedua okay aku akan bergelar duda
tua duda tua eh aku akan bergelarkan duda tua lah tak kisah lah tua ke pun tak kisah jadi aku bilang diri aku kalau aku dah duda tua tak ada duit lagi teruk jadi aku nak jadi duda tua tetapi ada duit kau faham
aku nak jadi orang berduit kirakan aku nak kena kerja kuat aku nak kena banyak berjimat cermat aku nak kena banyak cari kerja dapat kerja dapat allow tarik tau dapat kerja malam pun ambil dapat rezeki ambil simpan betul tak jadi kalau duit ni dah ada nak buat apa okay aku ada hutang kakak aku bayar sikit hutang kakak aku kasih sedekahkan mak bapak aku faham aku bagi apa kau faham keluarga aku dulu aku nak focuskan keluarga aku dulu
kita kerja ramai kawan betul tak kita dapat kawan jadi kalau kau perhatikan eh aku kadang-kadang suka message bebual sama yasir kau tahu kenapa tak yasir dengan aku pun sama dia pun tak ada bini tak ada matair kan yasir
jadi aku dengan yasir berbual pasal dia punya hidup jadi aku suka yasir dulu aku jumpa robert tapi robert dah buat hal kan sekarang dia buat hal sendiri robert aku rasa

dia sekarang status dia okay lah aku
kata dia dia bilang aku yang dia sudah denounce dia bilang aku dia dah denounce bulan may last year
jadi kira dah setahun lebih lah dia dah denounce tapi aku tahu mungkin dia buat itu kerana perasaan marah jadi
yang allah subhanallah wa taala dan tuhan kita dan nabi muhammad salallah wasalam kita punya ah rasulullah kita punya ini
aku rasa tak jadi masalah aku rasa masih boleh bawa dia ke dalam akram kan tapi pendapat ustaz sana kan dia boleh
ah peluk balik lah agama islam kan tapi mungkin nak kena bagi course lah kan
okay aku bilang kau terus terang lah eh selama perkahwinan aku lapan tahun dia
masih macam dulu dia takde macam dia tak macam islam sangat lah maksud aku di sini
ah dia kalau meet mak bapak aku pun dia pergi salam kan dia pakai macam pakai yang macam

jadi itu yang itu yang berlaku masa aku dengan dengan family aku yang lama lah that's what happens
jadi aku bilang kau eh kau punya jaga keluarga kau babe kalau satu hari engkau next time maybe next time kau tak jumpa aku macam sekarang
kalau satu hari kau akan berjumpa seorang perempuan yang cantik mungkin lagi muda sikit eh
kau harus engkau harus kuatkan iman kau ah engkau nak kena sembahyang ah kau nak kena kuatkan iman kau engkau tak boleh
kau tahu lah budak-budak muda sekarang kan dia tak peduli tau kalau kau dah ada anak bini tau
dia kalau sukakan kau ah dia punya cara simple tau okay lah kalau you suka I
you ceraikan bini you ah banyak macam gitu babe jadi
tahu tak apa dia orang tak peduli tau
ah kita punya masyarakat zaman sekarang very selfish mereka tak fikir ini semua
jadi kalau kau rasa yang kau engkau mesti ingat tau kau punya tujuan sana kerja
kalau ada situasi macam gini aku tahu ramai lelaki-lelaki kat luar sana yang akan
tak ada kan scandal dia orang lebih suka macam gitu tapi aku rasa kau orang baik kau jangan start ini semua lah tak baik kau tahu asal
nanti walau dia boleh bayar kau dia boleh sponsor kau dia boleh
ah support kau mungkin kau tak cukup duit sebab aku tengok kau kadang-kadang sesak macam aku juga kan
nanti dia kata eh azri you okay tak you you nampak macam apa ni takda ah I punya motor
dia punya ah spark plug meletup ah gini oh berapa tiga ratus ah nanti I transfer you
dia orang akan kalau perempuan tu kan kau dia akan buat ni semua babe dia akan beli kau dengan duit dia orang tapi bila kau dah termakan budi mereka
apa yang berlaku kau akan rasa bersalah sebab aku ada anak bini jadi kau mesti ingat tau kalau kau nak pinjam duit kalau perempuan nak tolong kau kau mesti hati-hati
nanti perempuan tu nak kau punya masa nak kau punya time commitment kau faham
azri nanti lepas nanti lunch time you nak pergi mana azri uh I nanti dabao ah makan dekat zam-zam dabao eh jangan dabao lah tak best azri tak panas

nak himpit kau kau berhati-hati tau kau jangan tergoda dengan bisikan syaitan
siala sini muka muka muka izzati abeh muka si kak zarina abeh muka sumati muka si kak sabariah
bukan ah kau tak akan kau tak boleh pandang remeh ni perkara kalau satu hari kau berjumpa dengan si girls macam gini kau ingat pesanan aku
jadi kau kau kau senyum dan kau cakap satu jer lah kau cakap
jangan marah ah itar saya ni
ah ada plan tengah hari mungkin nak jumpa I punya wife nak makan sama-sama kau bohongkan gitu sudah
itu lah cukup nak kasih dia piss off kau faham perempuan ni
bila dia orang nak bila cara untuk kau macam kasih mereka marah ataupun macam turn off kan
kau sebut nama perempuan lain mereka akan rasa turn off ataupun eh orang rumah kau itu tactic dia
ah jadi kau tanya aku kalau kau kalau kau takde sini macam mana bagi aku eh aku akan teruskan kerja sini macam biasa
aku tak boleh get attracted by your deparute kau tahu asal sebab kalau aku tinggalkan tempat ni kan
aku aku boleh bayankan cheng mun macam mana
he'll be under a lot of pressure faham
kau tahu lah li che tak suka dia
fiona pun tak suka dia aku rasa cheng mun pun mungkin tak suka dia roy pun tak suka dia ramai orang yang mungkin tak begitu suka dengan dia
pun macam gitu aku aniakan dia takkan babe sebab dia dah tolong aku
bila dia pilih aku terima aku bekerja walaupun aku melayu satu jer aku bilang diri aku
kenapa harus aku aniayakan dia aku nak kena support dia
that's why kalau satu hari tadi dia bilang mister see kan kau nampak kan kalau kalau kalau apek boleh tolong
aku akan beterima kasih sebab kirakan engkau pun support aku punya boss
chey syarikat seh kau cakap syarikat macam macam kat malaysia eh
dioye lah sini sini sini punya company ataupun iya lah syarikat untuk your right eh sini punya persatuan ah syarikat company semua ni kan
mereka punya cara satu mereka kalau boleh nak nak save cost ataupun nak kurankan perbelanjaan
dia orang nak kurangkan segala-galanya babe
mereka ada sikit macam apa tu favouritism memang dekat mana-mana semua ada
ah tapi bagi aku
tak ada sebab apa sebab sebab kita punya tu kan mereka dah cari orang tapi orang tu reject orang tu tak nak datang so bagi mereka aku dah buat aku punya kerja tetapi kalau
okay azri nice to meet you again so I just wanna say that kadang-kadang kita ni hidup
memang banyak dugaan life is full of challenges and of course what happens is like
jadi pendek kata kalau kita ni um
uh suka dengan kerja kita kita teruskan betul
kalau kita tak suka maybe dislike ataupun there's push like this then we have to
so in short K kita nak kena tahu
apa jua yang kita buat dalam dunia ini whatever we do here okay
ah jadi macam mana kau nak kekalkan kau punya ah
contohnya tadi aku bilang sama boss aku bilang sama you know aku bilangkan tadi kevin call aku kevin
so kevin came previously so if you saw right I put email dia I emailed him
dia punya request for this um to come down to check look at one eleven kan
was exhaust kau perasan eh so aku nak dia propose based on kita punya requirements apa dia punya exhaust fan size semua lah
so tomorrow he may come down around eleven thirty dia akan turun padang eleven thirty
kita bawa dia tengok tempat itu kan
then boss say kenapa aku cakap because when I try to activate rin cho
he can he macam ah always busy kau faham he got a lot of excuses right and then we he don't want to come then he cannot even give us the required proposals and quotations
so I told boss that I rather do not waste that kind of time and buang masa
tunggu contractor yang tak begitu focus
ataupun yang not really looking for all these things lah so aku bilang dengan boss
ah aku bilang boss ah aku bilang covalent so far is the only company
that have come a few times and then talk to azri and me about what they need kan kau ingat eh
ingat tak the earlier case about the issue at level nine of tower
dengar dengar dengar they are the only one eh that give the proposals for both the air issue and the and the motor you notice
they are the only one tau even Y&T tak kasih eh Y&T belum kasih
Y&T kasih yang dulu punya kau ingat ah Y&T kasih yang lama tu yang kita pernah reject alright
Y&T belum kasih tau ah abeh tu aku nampak ah kai long ada kasih motor oddly eh
air asia tak kasih lepas tu ah ray choo belum kasih abeh tu company C belum kasih
kau bayangkan tau of all kita punya contractor lima company
ini covalent one company can give us that two proposal tau and it's only company kau faham tak
kenapa wani tak nak kasih so it means aku nak kena gunakan dia orang punya specs
nak kena call lagi invite quote for the other company lah that's what aku nak kena bikin later
mana covalent
boleh ah kau tengok kau tengok proposal okay bagi aku okay not bad
dia propose bikin asia semua kan boleh
can be done ah so aku nak kena minta dia orang so whether they want to go or not itu masalah dia sekarang kita nak perlukan we need lagi dua quote betul
ah lagi dua quote kita perlukan lagi dua quote untuk aku bilang kau eh aku macam nak minta lye kasih kita quotation sia untuk aircon works kalau dia boleh bikin
lye boleh
lye lye lye lye ini tau takkan tak boleh
kau cakap orang ke melayu orang putih ni kau cakap orang putih ke melayu nama dia orang putih cakap betul-betul lah
bukan ah aku belum tanya dia lagi tapi aku rasa macam nak panggil dia orang sebab
aku tengok eh macam rin joo
dia kasih kita proposal kan dia rin joo belum kasih tau dia punya proposal I will write to him again
so far I've not really okay you see eh aku tak tahu what was the arrangement before my time
tetapi bagi aku aku still akan invite dia to quote for whatever that he needs to quote lah correct
sebab the idea was given by him correct pasal itu motor correct
so ini semua aku nak kena standby dia punya argument aku nak kena standby any email dapat nak kena tembak email sebab
every month care pax kita nak kena update alexis tau apa dia punya updates kau faham
takpe I will just send them another invite because I'm going to send invite to beberapa contractor jadi I want to see how is ah their
response and memastikan mereka boleh berikan peluang aku tak nak satu hari nanti mereka cakap oh aku penat-penat turun padang I came all the way down meet azri and rasyidi
I gave proposal tapi yang dapat kerja orang lain aku tak nak ini punya cerita
kita dah berbual selama empat puluh dua minit alhamdulillah jadi tak mengapa

ini tak kena mengena dengan kita tapi aku cakap nevermind kau just tengok kita punya issue you see our air issue
ah kita part kita dah maintain lah jadi tempat kau orang nak kena buat sesuatu so
we just let him know that what have been done and what required by the tenant ah faham
ah aware aware aware ya he will tell victoria meter punya cerita very simple as per fiona's permalas fiona said
this one install okay lah noted noted I not sure I'm here I'm only here six months I'm not sure so dia cakap
ah kata dia lah so okay lah so diam tak diam kirakan yang yang suruh rosakkan
so that is the arrangement lah so tomorrow si covenant turun
we have to focus on this O one eleven exhaust kau tahu pasal
ini benda eh we really need to get the quote soon because richard dah tanya orang pun dah tanya
because ini beruang punya madam F kau si xie
si gemuk tu kan dia nak handover bulan september tau
he wants she wants to handover in september like that kau faham
ah place ah so mereka dia ada plan yang
hebat lah untuk dapat tempat tu tapi
she got some requirement kau nampak there's some that you saw the email I know did you saw
top up dia punya cement twenty five add twenty five
lepas tu half of the probing
then number dua dia kata apa dia nak apa tu then they want to put the
nak letak gas outside lah then they want to puncture to our it is like good to have aesthetics
ah dia dia kirakan they want to do a lot of things okay but but whatever they do
to the centre of the place that is dia orang punya ah so called short floor lah correct
jadi ah twenty twenty five tau look
lepas tu dia orang kat atas ada big kitchen so that the other half eh all the way to the end of the unit is dia orang punya area ah
ah itu naik atas ah naik naik nak naik tu mesti naik punya
tapi kalau kau tak nampak tak obvious ah kan
depan depan the shop front front would not be affected yang belakang dia akan itu
ah they won't akan affect lah because behind they have to put some
ah frosted glass ke apa they have to do something to cover the behind ah
tapi dia orang ada intention nak letak itu gas cylinder itu sebelah kanan
the dia punya piping dia cat warna putih tembus kita punya ah cladding tau masuk dalam above ceiling
toilet eh dia orang kan most likely aku tengok dia orang akan convert sebagai store because dia kata dia tak nak dia punya staff gunakan toilet tu
okay lah I mean tu dia punya hak kan it's up to them
then they can dia orang boleh convert tempat itu untuk macam tempat simpan barang-barang lah
ah to me okay lah I mean as long as dia orang bikin
apa yang dia nak gini tapi so far aku rasa based on my understanding is like
ah cakap dengan fiona I told fiona as and as long as you tie your sprinkler
that is a requirement tapi kan he said masa tu cakap tak payah there is a waiver from then you must show us which clause ah
tak boleh dia mesti ada submission you must do a proper submission

mereka nak kita buat sesuatu for the untuk mereka for their ah ladder
lye lye boleh bikin ataupun um
satu kedua dia kata they will get dia orang punya contractor to come and see the place lah apa-apa lah kan
they want to see but because they want to provide another alternative lah because initially mereka cakap apa
ah just apply sealant after they take out old sealant kau tak nak
so now mereka nak bikin another proposal okay lah
lima puluh minit lah belum lagi empat minit lagi okay kau ada empat minit babe untuk cakap ada soalan lagi untuk aku tak apa apa lagi soalan kau what else your questions

kalau dulu tak ada dulu masa company lama kan my old company
whatever my gave my will do whatever my give that's it tu final tau
ah tu macam baru bagus
will know the situation better and kalau also feels that okay
so dia orang dah sign dah sign dah sign hantar dekat no way nobody can can can ni tau
because eh they give full trust to the side staff punya in-charge in this case or the apa ni
that's why tinggal dulu abeh kalau sini macam mana

tapi bergantung kepada orang sana kalau sana rasa kau takde apa-apa you are nothing boleh
itu normal normal aku pun kena gitu juga bikin

yang penting babe itu rambut kena warna hitam babe hitam eh rambut kena hitam jangan lupa
itu sahaja dua satu akhir alhamdulillah syukur stop
get a get a real job yes ha susah sia nak cari kerja sekarang
err I ya lah but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me uh pasal my wish is my need ah right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish ah to something else I tak tahu apa ah
dia orang cakap by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb err
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know oh my god I don't know how we gonna do it lah but ah I rasa dia punya
dia punya the struggle is gonna be real lah like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless kita hop on trends or unless
we have quality content lah but I think we have quality content eh I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that err getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I rasa itu paling susah lah sia
I think you are confusing streaming dengan video kita memang buat video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the err console to record the whole the whole the whole session
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing ah so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play lah because I don't think people wanna do that yet kita kita not at that level lah nor we want to venture there pasal kita I think
streamers orang they are like deejays they are like radio deejays dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak inside jokes ah where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff lah but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality ah ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
so people will be interested lah I I I baca dekat dalam dekat youtube dia orang cakap if you want to start something like this ah you have to be you have to know what you are
uh like you are trying to focus on ah macam
macm kita kita nak kena main this specific game jer tau because what people want is people want
this content from you jer so you macam the speciality ah so ya macam they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a macam a doctor advising sickness what that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy kita nak kena like specialise in this one game jer and then like a random kadang-kadang kita we see if we can selit one or two games inside
apa like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game lah ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I rasa challenging sia
tak ah of course not man
kita punya tak begitu sia I I make sure the content that we kita push out semua quality sia I mean it it should provoke a feeling lah and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness err like you kalau ketawa I think that's that's quite good already ah where we ini kerja keras like a no brainer you just tengok habis doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad lah pasal kita edit susah payah kerja keras sia ni
oh the live stream one memang tak ada apa-apa like only live stream one is really moments lor the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
settle sia I dah belikan safwan dah
err I rasa like fifty err so ya I think fifty to hundred and fifty ya it was quite cheap
because kalau pergi yang kedai betul punya
but this one I got it for cheap lah like dekat Ali Express so that was good
so I think they have to like get the measurements right actually I also don't know whether they got the measurements right cause err I mean it fits ah I have no complains ah so I assume they the custom made it ah cause they they asked to put the measurement and I did measure myself ukur ukur ukur ya
got your help with that ah you ukur kepala ukur shoulder ukur my forearms
for the kids is just S M L I dah belikan safwan tengah on the way safi tak tahu kalau dia nak pakai ke tak maybe when he's older a bit
spider gwen ah okay okay ya tengok ah rezeki kalau ada lebih
I rasa nak pakai black cat lah no black cat is a spiderman version of cat woman but he's a black cat no
yes no I don't know I tak pernah where got spider spider cat is cat not a spider I say black cat I never say spider yes
I rasa nanti I minta cheese fries ah
tomorrow tomorrow dah call dah kalau tidak
take lah half day bila lagi nak ambil
next two weeks baru christmas
next week ada apa
ya is it bila you on leave right I thought you have long leave like
I accumulate dua puluh hari sia you
I selalu I selalu err selalu like fikir macam like last year punya tu I selalu tak nak habiskan I selalu simpan for the day that I want to leave the company
my plan is always to keep leave so I can macam ni I have to serve notice two months sia you now at least I clear leave I serve like
no lah from dulu sia I macam itu
I selalu tak nak habiskan if I can bring forward I will bring forward
there is no point in I don't know lah to me macam kalau kita tak kalau kita ambil leave to not go on holiday why would you want to take that leave
some more kita tengah work from home kan
bila dia hospitalised eh
because it's not dia tak tu ah dia nak kena kita punya sink kan dia punya bawah tu kan gemuk
IKEA punya is you remove that sink ada pipe theirs is for that pipe jer kita for the whole gemuk punya thingy
there is but it won't be err apa tu macam flush ah
the it's it's like a is a triangle so it's two triangles lah kalau you nak beli is two triangles but because it's not flush because that thing is gemuk dia it will protrude out lah so you won't be flush so you will be like ke depan ah
because kalau buat satu then the other one tak buat then the next time kena buat then is like err what buang masa but I think it's fast kan yang that time your father tukar jamban knock knock knock letak jamban baru macam cepat sia like in less less than a day dah habis sia ya that time remember ya lah he call somebody ah your err abang punya father

you look like macam apa pre pack your food macam ini you taruh dulang like cantik ah nampak ayam nampak semua ah
instead of that ah so that cakap possible not to do this dia cakap yes possible
so ibu cakap okay lah since dia cakap possible so I make a table lah put there
tray lah dulang in a in a dulang lah I cakap
dia cakap ya possible
so after that I send him the table to show that dia jangan salah lah
then okay they can put now dia pergi buat satu dulang
four daging
apa eh
I cakap hidup
if I known I cakap I won't ask you is it possible I ask you is it possible then you said ya ya can
itu that time kelmarin yang
we order takoyaki uh that day satu then after that we order yang nasi yang masa mika datang itu ibu order the tray satu
ayah satu buang lah but we actually ibu nak buang sekali ayah pergi cuci so ibu okay ayah sudah cuci put aside lah so ibu pakai that tray lah
so the rest pasal ibu ada tupperware besar sikit then okay lah put there lah ya
ibu purposely bikin table tau
uh ya lah like macam I I put there berapa eh
okay I put there bento mandi chicken
mutton masala okay that one's all correct memang one bento one packet
then three bento uh bento mandi chicken with add on kofta kebab
okay that one also correct ada tiga mandi chicken with
then I book one set mandi chicken uh buffet for five pax itu yang
dia bikin yang ibu cakap untuk kita kan dia cakap for five pax itu pun okay I he understood one set
then in the end dia kasih kat ibu
ya lah after that ibu call dia lah pasal bila sampai dia kasih ibu like packet dia ibu cakap macam tak nampak that round tray ada empat it's it's only satu but then I don't want to make a fuss I I ah cakap eh this one is only satu jer habis dia cakap ya lah ya lah I'm like just carry jer
just carry bring back itu lah then bila sampai rumah nenek ayah nak pack pack lah kat situ habis kat sana macam panas kan then ibu cakap no lah hantar rumah nenek satu then after that
kita pack pack
uh habis pergi rumah nenek then baru ibu buka ibu buka
satu jer that big round tray with itu habis
then I call her lah I say cakap you know when I say you put in my table I stated there four set what so by right must have four set lah why it's only one if not I just put one set right
otherwise ibu pun tanya dia it's possible because in your photo it's already show what is only five and above punya tak ada one pax for apa one round tray for two pax
entah lah jiu yang hari itu kasih habis after that
dia cakap okay lah habis dia cakap then how ah why like that I have to solve myself lah you ibu cakap
ask me how okay sorry lah this is miscommunication lah dia cakap
habis ibu cakap ya ya ya ya
tapi the night before I think before dia buat I think wednesday
can I just confirm that those bento change to dulang
is four bento of ayam and four bento of daging am I right
so masa itu ibu tengah tengok jadi ibu ibu cakap okay wassalam sis zus yes including four kebab so I think they misunderstood this
bila dia cakap salam can you just confirm yang those bento change to dulang
is four bento ayam and four bento of daging and rice so dia pergi taruh into one dulang
so maybe they refer balik to this
tapi dia tak pergi refer balik to the table then I cakap you look at the table table I put there four set
uh marah lah then
I brought actually I just inform err apa ibu bilang aunty bait jer yang okay no need to cook uh I'm giving you something to eat lah habis aunty bait cakap okay lah so the rest ibu tak bilang uh aunty lisha ibu bilang because ibu takut dia bawa siapa mika pergi swimming
jadi takut dia tak tahu jadi ibu cakap uh I'm sending apa
to you lah habis dia kata no need lah no need save money lah now COVID lah save money I cakap I pay already lah cakap dia cakap don't waste money like that I pay already lah oh you pay already uh uh okay
so I promise ibu sudah cakap aunty bait dengan aunty lisha saja so the rest ibu tak cakap then just imagine kalau semalam ibu sudah balik ibu balik dua belas setengah dua belas setengah balik sini uh pack pack pack sudah pukul berapa orang pun hungry nasib baik ibu tak bilang yang lain ada orang tunggu tunggu kata nak hantar lauk kat mana uh
tapi dia orang hungry macam mana
the one who make noise is ayah bukan ibu lah
of course ibu uh huh angry juga lah but then ibu tak
you know ayah kan the way ayah cakap kan that's why ibu cakap no
sometime we plan but allah yang tentukan yang whether
of course we will nak macam gini tapi we plan but then if asal allah tak izinkan allah cakap no it cannot be planned as what you want I will change the plan so uh if you can like this lah
ah dia bila dia gitu dia diam lah nanti jap ya lah tapi
uh tapi bila ibu cakap allah itu dia diam lah
and then kalau ibu cakap like uh
tak apa lah agak orang itu apa mana boleh ah dia kata
so by the time ibu hantar pun sudah pukul berapa
ah balik itu
duduk lah berbual dengan tipet tak habis
oh mengopi habis lepas itu kau cakap
uh ambil izu boleh

the berbual baik-baik boleh jadi lapan jam jadi empat jam saja

I I hope satu hari ah I hope so that
anime ada banyak type like what's your genre in anime
aku pun agree
selain anime
tak tahu ah this one is your favourite or not but it is two days one night
oh he's I don't know when is the last time I watched two days one night tak tahu ah bila
I tengok running man jer
my favourite girl group uh tak tahu ah pernah dengar ke tak
kalau aku ingat it is
agaknya that time
kalau uh I
but dekat sini
makanan apa you suka
like asam rebus you know especially when
I also think macam itu juga ah
kalau for me
um selain McDonald's what's your favourite fast food also
yes ya dia dari uh datang dari filipino
I boleh makan like three piece or five piece of chicken
it's just sedap
tempat dia dekat sana juga ah I think we talking about the same thing
and err ya mostly barang macam
mee goreng combo
because it's near dia dekat dengan botanic garden ah
I always eat dekat Adam's Corner
cause you just need to uh naik bridge
and and you already reach it uh macam dalam five minute
if I go makan there I think
maggi goreng combo and the drinks I think
oh I'm sorry my melayu rabak sikit
so tebu is definitely not bamboo
K K I'm K salah saya
I pergi sana is because
so bila I go there ah
dia kerja dekat suria is it
I tak tengok news
kalau free ke apa tengok lesung
sekarang ni I watch bara
aku rasa uh
dah ada dekat uh mobile
uh habis senang untuk kita just you know
you pay one-time fee habis senang untuk
can watch your favourite anime tapi depends ah
sometimes not all the show that you want ada dekat dalam
apa cerita you tengok dekat
yes so kadang-kadang my class start at eight
the latest that I arrive paling lambat I think pukul lapan
tapi I will try my best to come school early next time
cuba juga improve my
now I have a lot of projects so tengah nak habiskan semua
lama seh
I think nak apply kerja
susah lah nak cari duit
err bulan depan
apa-apa you cakap tadi ah
dalam masa depan pun I think will continue my studies
apa you join
tak tak tahu kenapa also I join then when I was sec three
my kawan uh all ajak me go
and that's where I grew my interest dengan rugby
I anggap rugby as a
whenever nak pergi training
so bila kaki tu injured
uh kena pergi doctor
so bila
time kecil tu my bicycle
tapi is not your normal bicycle is like
so daripada situ I pick up uh skateboarding also
so I play dengan skateboard together
tak ada break any bones because I want to continue playing
dengan skateboard and also maybe hopefully
kalau boleh lah um play rugby in another ten years
we live our life together sama-sama in dalam satu rumah happily
tapi I hope that phase three is coming soon because tak sabar nak pergi malaysia
tak mahu cakap pasal mask
then when you breathe and there's fog dekat cermin mata
I can't wear contact lens takut
my kawan like
I pun tak sabar nak uh habiskan ini COVID
ya sedih bila dengar Teo Heng is closing down
tapi um if it's not karaoke
I rasa I nak pergi main bola dengan my kawan
oh of course I want to keluar dengan my family
uh ajak dia orang pergi dinner um
you know uh pergi
tak pernah dengar pasal hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher tu boleh buat untuk staycation
dah lama plan
ease off my mind off uh jauh dari rumah at least you know
meet somewhere that macam
uh boleh relax my mind
bila I go wild wild wet
kita pergi wild wild wet but actually it's different because
kena lineup time uh the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people dekat dalam you only can go one round
boleh enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
cannot agaknya bring my girlfriend along
um actually tak pernah pergi sana but I hope to try
like just now bila
I cakap I don't like uh I mean I like heights right
I takut
bila dia tengah naik suddenly dia turun
tapi no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
ada ah similar
tapi tak boleh lah because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and nak cuba
there's satu specific
that I suka
it's a M three uh I tahu you don't like cars but
ya actually betul juga ah macam
tak tipu actually is one of my favourite
tokyo drift punya cerita uh in all the movies
kalau you percaya there's nine fast and furious movie
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so macam dah malas nak tengok
ya macam for me
macam mana I boleh suka bola like
semenjak kecil uh
semua of my family
uh yes ada baby pictures of me wearing a
actually I suka club too because of the history
uh but it's datang from a rival club ah
after like how many years dia orang menang club uh cup
um I'm not being a hater tapi macam I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
kalau tak nak pergi kerja you can always take tapi kalau dah ambil
uh pergi lah rest dekat rumah
hards hard time has to come first baru
easy life baru datang so don't expect everything to be easy
ya I get what you mean tapi
harap that everything will
and boleh dapat uh boleh dapat kerja senang
kalau boleh everybody at uh live their normal life after that
I hope that good news akan datang
kalau tak we will if orang tak uh
akan datang ah
it looks quite interesting lah I think kita should pergi like
err I think ada banyak ah ada tom yum ada
macam-macam lah a lot lah I mean we can just go there and see it's quite affordable also
pun ada dia macam steamboat then macam ada tempat you can masak macam apa ni hotplate eh something they call it
hotplate pun ada macam-macam lah
and kita nak tukar to andes pun boleh
biasa lah melayu kan suka barbeque
adam maybe kalau adam nak
so macam okay so because hafizah also tengah tidur sekarang so I also don't know whether dia nak ke tak
car lite I think a bit mahal because weekend then must top up petrol some more
oh tak tahu lah maybe dia letak air kat dalam
oh belum masih dalam bag dalam bag hafizah
ya betul betul actually kita boleh makan kat ni garden you want or not
mm ada fifty percent
mm selain daripada dining in garden apa lagi ada
I mean ya kita boleh ada alternative kat sana banyak alternative
oh jom ah kita pergi sedap mania
kalau tak pergi sadap mania pergi mana
katakan adam tak ikut
boleh lah
ya I mean apa tu okay lah kalau nak kita pergi cuba so our trip can be from
you know maybe bau jer sedap mania habis tu kita nak bicycle
tengok jurassic meyer habis kita makan jinjja chicken tapi kan that time I went to jewel um
uh ahad punya malam
so um the queue ah panjang ah lepas tu tempat dia duduk kena like they put us in front of the entrance so it was very awkward lah duduk kat depan orang nak lalu-lalang lalu lintas so
I tak tahu lah apa tu um macam mana begitu but
ya like singapore memang got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated punya food places ah the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about A&W baru halal kan
dekat jewel pun ada
kita kan nak pergi cycling
ya true also tapi tak boleh cycling
not really sure I think macam crab meat
shiitake cendawan shiitake
ya memang yummy
hari ini cheat day
K ya so macam mana
bukan B B nine eh
bukan eh
um K boleh ah
ke cakap pasal shares lah
I nak try lah baru try try I nak try stock then I macam rasa-rasanya tesla will grow lah in the future
sebab ya because a lot of countries are macam adopting err are banning petrol vehicles by
by investing in macam electric car company ini kan all those clean energy ones
the shares would probably go up lah in the future like maybe not now maybe dalam lima sepuluh tahun
macam bitcoin dulu lah bitcoin dulu also low kan but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance tapi I think like macam those stocks yang
yang permissible macam you know yang tak go against the basic purpose ah macam those thoughts yang deal with um vices then
you know all those macam clearly apa ni
that's my pandangan lah on this
okay for me eh I think kita kena macam
diversify lah our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like macam
uh wahed invest so this is a macam
only macam
syariah compliant punya stocks trading platform lah so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
commodities ah macam cash ke gold
ambil bonds and all these are like certified to be syariah compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in macam these kind of companies
you don't have to put in effort lah you just letak your money then you just
based on my experience dia punya fees is
tapi like maybe this is one
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms yang offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
maybe you can feedback to jangan invest in bonds
macam bank bapa kita
oh like betul lah I mean yang what you say is true cuma
I mean you want apa ethical investing eh in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
those the regular accounts lah me you have no choice what tapi that's why err you have to do your own research lah if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
err mana-mana company I mean mana-mana banks
cakap pasal investment ni macam mana kita punya trip ni
so dia punya kentut signify more to yes ke more to no
kita err
I think she I mean she's free lah it's whether dia nak ke tak
ya maybe dia malas lah tapi anyway dia dah agree apa sunday dia okay
ya mahal sikit ah situ
ubin mana makcik punya
boleh actually boleh tapi semua orang kena okay lah
besok tak crowded
oh so kita dah dah missed lah
unless kita pergi besok
kita pergi terus pergi ubin
oh ya tak nak
any lah islands or whatever sisters' islands ke batu ke bukit
eh itu jangan cuba I I okay punya
I pakai my army boot steady
we can okay lah listen to it later lah takkan nak busuk busuk semua but I mean take the car car lite lah car lite maybe we go in the day
then we explore these like macam make sense lor
huh mahal apa

how about those yang tinggal kat at risk blocks
boon keng eh boon keng ada ke at risk block
oh ya I heard also from my uncles because dia orang cakap dia punya kawan pun tinggal sana semua residents
ya pernah
oh I tell you just story lah ya of course lah I mean yang paling err famous is their macam a lot of drug addicts lah kat sana
err let kejap ah apa nama dia
jauh jauh jauh lah I think ah dia tinggal boon keng jauh
oh okay lah lame oh nama dia uh
nama okay lah I shouldn't cakap nama lah pasal tak baik kan kita expose orang I should just panggil dia Q lah
no lah it's one of my relatives lah dia quite kesian lah so
oh so macam ya dia dia tinggal dengan mak dia then dengan datuk dia
oh datuk dia ah
boleh lah datuk dia close juga lah tak close lah pernah jumpa lah like visit
so okay lah cuma kesian lah dia seorang kat rumah dia takde adik beradik kan then mak dia mak dia doctor actually
I'm not sure tapi I think dia general practitioner lah I don't think that specialize in anything
tapi maybe eh if I'm not wrong dia specialise in psychology
boleh lah
dia kawan doctor dia kawan police
vet tak
betul betul I think you didn't mothership ke bukan mother's gossip
ya I think betul lah I mean like kesian juga ah like people look down right all these people tapi in actual fact right you put any human being in that kind of
environment ah I'm talking about the block eh bukan the orang-orang lah block lah you put in that kind of block macam lonely kan takde family I mean takde support adik-beradik so any human being will also macam experience something will experience the same thing lah

because it's expensive eh you know COVID treatment there is like thirty thousand sia not like us like you go to doctor with like respiratory punya illness or whatever cock and then like you go you ah apa you go there again you get we pay ten dollars they have to pay for a nonsense amount of money one doctor's visit is like hundred plus sia
quite quite a high amount ah like merepek kind of prices ah like here okay ah somebody sick just call ambulance ah next time can pay I mean at the end of the day it's government run so like
at the end of the day if they are able to like do so much for the COVID punya crisis they have a lot of bank lah so
apa lagi kau nak kan
oh they tutup
ya it's always always like that one it doesn't do anything is more of a macam threat kind of thing
no this is this is called no it's diplomacy it's called like macam firm diplomacy lah or some shit like that
because they keep saying that taiwan is part of china like jangan world lah bro
and then like they are not under the world health organisation punya data list because they are not listed as a country
that one that one that one really rabak sia
no now it's worse because of COVID now you know malaysia lockdown you know ah ape tu

so he's like then I message he message me boring ah kat kampung aku nak balik main computer
apa then I like I didn't know that time that was lockdown I found out from him it's like ah lockdown balik then it's like ah lockdown sia
they all busy fighting each other also so takpe ah
like the Shell there and that's it then like macam boring eh macam
ya but can is can ah but malas
like ni semua nak tak nak
tapi to me tak nak dia lebih ah so tak nak ah
sad sia all the green ah all the green punya policies that obama put in place all gone
he got a lot illegal shit that he has done he scared kena indicted
that's how he won the millennial punya vote ah eight years back he was one of the first few politicians who was actively like in
come on look look at michelle obama all very ya quite influential in terms of macam presidents
because she's one thing because she's a woman lah and women of colour is another thing and then she is like not not not like black like she's like latino ah and then another thing macam she very fierce
for the benefit of the people you all don't want then you all macam
no the thing is dia world and then people still believe him I like sial ah and recently his rallies all the people wear mask wear at all but when did he ever come out with a negative test
like sometimes they ask celebrities like especially macam controversial issues lah
pissed right he got angry he tweet out and then he say because of the fake news media I will release the video first before the sixty minute come out then I like that's his hit back macam you gonna release it first because he wants to say that macam they gonna portray it like differently but then macam
tak kan they repeat the loop and you didn't realise in one hour right
ya I mean if you say you love the bible right it's like saying you love the quran oh which surah you like you know then you like oh I don't know man like it's private then I'm like
ya no the thing is like no I that people oh ya there was one one guy you know there's this guy that time macam oh who you voting for like that time what he does these interviews with trevor noah like he does these interview at trump rallies and ask all these questions about conspiracy theories and whatever shit lah
so that time he was asking like oh ah ape
ah who are you voting this guy ask lah like this random trump guy like so are you voting for trump this year he's like ya so how how's your uh what do you do for a job then it's like oh no he ask like macam how's your how do you think trump is affecting the economy oh is
or all these like or ape
ya lah so you just camp at the nurses punya houses then you wait
oh dia on dia tidur confirm dia on tidur punya
can cancel you you need to pay or not that time tak ah
dia punya waiting time dah justify the thing ah
ajak fight ah that one ajak fight
online ah then tidur ah then eh dah setengah jam
okay kita start hari ni pelan pelan
ah tak tak
dua jam memang ajak fight
it's like it's like the you know there is the apa tu the video the guy Deliveroo at he didn't want to go up the stairs because this apartment had no stairs
ah that's why aku macam bodoh sia jangan sia like oh my god that's why
I'm going to complain complain man mm you ain't coming down macam sial
perangai asshole sia
but but Deliveroo is like that ah memang the
but macam if there's a lift and then you got an excuse lah
tak pe ah become the cashier ah buka sendiri you know take out the cash
I would mengamok sia like fuck you man
jangan bodoh bro
semalam aku try main twenty then uh it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be sia
starting then you straightaway cam dia kasi kau options nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni so everything was macam flow after flow after flow after flow okay
semalam aku try main it's not like that sia
so ah apa tu kau dah create everything semua once kau dah start the game yet and everything and whatnot kan
apa tu positional positional training tactics kan they give you multiples multiple apa tu
tactic kau pilih sendiri
so formation apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri
no that that is still lah macam they give you pre-default uh
apa style kau nak main in that game for your players to play kan
can depend lah so let's say this game kau main tiki-taka four three one
then the next game kau nak main gegenpress four two three one pun boleh
yang gegenpress tiki-taka is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink kalau these two tak interlink
kau nya formation tak leh work
tak boleh ah tapi kalau kau buat gitu
it also depends on kau punya team punya apa tu familiarity of the tactics ah
ada ada ah
wah itu aku belum check sia actually
but yang what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense ah so macam ah there's this one player dia punya role is a central midfielder
macam their own behaviour in the games lah how they will react in the game ah
but then most of the minor minor leagues ah macam I see I go to the austrian league ke I go to the
aku balik jer dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus
in the span of apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam sia dorang improve
dah empat tahun sia
kalau tak salah dah lima tahun siol
tu kau masih poly so bila kau masih poly kan uh
tu kau year three aku year one so that means ya it's been five years ah
it will be quite late lah I mean for now kalau kau pergi download epic games it should be free pe
aku dah cakap dengan kau dia free
aku tak check
cause aku tahu
aku nya laptop yang I buy is meant for gaming
NVIDIA ada ada
semua ada ah all settle already
but should be boleh ah cause on my old laptop yang aku nya graphic card is based on intel's graphic card tau
cannot do anything punya
highly on graphic I mean you know nya graphic macam mana kan
kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya avatar nya muka dah macam
ah then after that your players pun lari dia pun macam you you know lah the graphic is
macam mana kan so
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is uh kau nak kena ada banyak data untuk kau nya computer ah kalau computer kau tak ada data then
macam tak ada space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then tu yang problem ah but
if kalau computer kau aku rasa ada memory then
macam slack sana sini in bola aku tahu but I
itu aku tak tahu ah how it will turn out lah but then
you can try at least ah maybe when you play the game then cara player dia jalan semua will be a bit
lag sana sini but on top of that
tu touch
not here not there punya type of products kan then I would see why phone will not be able to tahan by itself lah cause uh it's
it's there is too much detail in one team abeh kau tahu dulu kan kau main kan is just
okay player kau gini backroom kau happy dah sudah
settle sekarang dah tak siol
sekarang kan that player ada ada core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
macam this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so you have to push him into the social league ah into social group kalau tak you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
habis ah backroom kau terus habis ah
they influence influence influence influence terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang
so that means dia dia kirakan macam the senior of the group tau
okay so then kalau kau bring in a fresh new guy let's say uh you bring another senior player from this team masuk your team eh
takde gunanya cause
kau senior kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau junior juga apa
then but before that he was from dortmund so bila dia balik dortmund straightaway dia masuk balik as a influential player
a senior in the sense tapi kalau let's say kau bawa uh young players like mbappe over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there pe
ah so no matter how good he is he still get outlier macam aku punya dortmund sekarang sancho is an outlier
so macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam
it's like me when I was in the navy apa
cause kau tahu players kan dorang ada dia punya own friends ke apa benda ke so then they have their own players that they are closed with macam kawan gitu kan so then kalau maybe
you bring him to a new club yang uh
but then kalau kau ada player macam dia suka let's say he favours uh I will give you buckley lah
okay kau bring him to the club buckley ada then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group yang penting is they join the social group
in a sense lah cause it will affect your dressing room nya happiness ah
so kalau dressing room kau tak happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
so your dressing room nya happiness actually
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september tak salah aku
once kau free install it's free forever it's like uh playstation Xbox membership
kau download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library kau uninstall kau install balik pun the game is still be free
it's not your laptop nya LAN cable pe it's kau punya router nya cable pe
merepek pe
computer kau berapa lama sia ni
no Zoom lag it's not cause of kau punya itu Zoom will lag only cause of kau punya connection
laptop kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak
cause kadang-kadang kalau laptop kau is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I tak I mean
susah lah sia kau nak tu it'll be damn slow ah
that game is very intensive sia data dia
aku on tiga league eh aku port aku buka empat league four players per league eh aku nya computer speed jer dia punya processor speed kan for the whole for the whole game tu kan dah four star
empat league jer tau
tak tahu ah kalau kau nak malam kau nak jumpa boleh jumpa ah malam aku tak kesah
aku balik jer terus aku boleh jumpa kau ah
abeh kau fikir aku familiar ah kirakan aku pun baru ambil download jer semalam
ya I downloaded it yesterday okay aku tak I never touch the app
aku tu dah jumpa kau pe
correct aku download aku jumpa kau after aku kita berbual semua and everything aku balik dah pukul satu pagi
aku buka tu computer aku tukar cup sana sini tukar tukar tukar aku tidur pukul tiga pagi
there is that thing lah I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab kan yang came out
no kau maybe let's say uh okay cause kau tahu you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad pe so kau boleh remove filter ah hide injured players
merepek sia kau
technically you are apa kan bodoh
ah tu kau nak
eh kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat singapore pe
dulu kau boleh ah tak ada coronavirus you can just go around and ah beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik
kau stuck lah unless they didn't go home they stay in your country ah
ah then gitu maybe uh
kau ada chance ah to play and whatnot lah but if
eh apa tu
maybe if satu hari you go lower than that baru you come out with a semi-pro club
so even if you win games your point kena deducted
until someone else macam you know what
atau they pump atau your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time tu championship which needs five K
but whether your club kat dalam ah the club kau ada loss ke ada profit ke ah there it
tak kira dah cause at the end of day
kalau player kau
ada there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent one was this italian club I forgot what club it was
okay so dah tinggi pe kirakan serie A pe dia up there tau and then
itu lain lah itu tak kira lah bodoh
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist ah terus hilang
nari ada club esok takde club ah gitu ah
so terus takde ah then club dia hilang that's one thing so uh what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan kasi berapa ke
that you know lah some of the fans in this club kan quite rich pe so dorang kata okay you know what aku suka club ni but then sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit okay ah aku pump duit
but ada ada yang lain ah tu really aku tak tahu ah sia kau kena kau kena
cari sendiri ah tu aku
kita ada sia actually
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself apa so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
kita mimpi jer lah tu eh
at the end of day kita semua semi-pro sia
if you're passionate about it then okay pe macam
dah gemuk cakap jer lah dah gemuk tak yah lah
so then macam
tu lah kau baru nak cakap
tak ah
dalam empat tahun jer lah
aku dah dalam dua dua tahun juga tak main ah I mean
sekarang dengan situation gini camne aku nak main bola sia
so what this guy did was dia tak slide ah
I'm in front of you I cannot slide aku tak boleh slide tackle kau kan so aku baring on the floor ah
aku baring jer
terus bola will hit badan aku kau will jump over me apa
aku bangun I take the ball run away ah
aku tak pernah dengar sia orang buat gini kau first time siol abeh macam
boleh boleh cause
takde time kan
ah ya lah betul lah I mean
memang gitu lah I mean apa kau nak buat kan
kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit I mean tengok kita sekarang
no lah yang the apa tu
one thing yang we need to go and find kan is that cup lee hsien loong used
eh tu cawan bagus siol kau minum jer kau tukar kau boleh berbual ah bahasa lain sia
aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum ah kau
dia boleh pe
kau tak I mean the the election before the previous election kan
I would listen to melayu if I somewhat understood chim malay lah I mean kau tengok when I had to go for the interview in malay eh nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye
aku gabra siol
aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing ah so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then oh okay sorry nak kena berbual melayu so nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa word ni eh
takpe aku keluarkan english word ah then I speak english again so it's very
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids macam hari tu aku pergi ah aku gi pancing pe kat changi kan
aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan each other kan they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu cause dia berbual english kan dia nya english was
better than our parents lah in a in a sense lah cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so aku macam
okay ni budak melayu and then budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu
melayu is a first language english is their second language
so there's a chance bila kita dah tua
kita tak akan ingat any other language except for
but then you weren't in malaysia apa you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
for example lah kita tak tahu berbual melayu at all dia langsung tak ada melayu okay kita cuma boleh berbual english
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay pe maybe that makcik was sebab apa tu ah dia belajar
english dengan dari tempat lain then dia forever concentrate dengan english
ah abeh kita tak tahu pe anything can happen kan
ah ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak kan apa gunanya aku berbual kan betul tak
all these old people kalau you actually listen to them talk kan some of them do make sense lah I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time merepek sia dengar
ya sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik
oh dia jiran kau okay lah tu kau boleh buat member
aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini so aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana okay lah aku dah tahu ah
mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal ah hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia ah it can be like that pe
all I see tadi err bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni kan aku sesat uh
aku dah masuk lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there aku stuck dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok
tingkat mana sia dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas then in my mind
correct house eh kalau tak malu sia aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan
kau tahu last aku datang rumah kau bila ah

like a few months dah aku tak jumpa kau is it a few months
mm ada lah
ke january is it
ya tapi I mean aku still contact aku still contact kau I still contact you on on on mm
do a lot of things lah but macam
I mean tak lah aku betul juga now now that you now that you mention about err last time when we were in school we
sekarang aku baru ingat balik actually ya lah actually quite true lah macam aku used to
primary school aku dulu kat katong punya area kan then
then there was macam a lot of
macam drains ada banyak longkang-longkang besar
so that time tengah primary school tengah pendek kecil kan so like
after school nanti main bawah longkang masuk bawah longkang then keluar dekat lagi satu punya longkang punya area keluar kat luar jer kan
that kind of thing so a'ah lah betul juga lah so I think
wow jauh eh actually wow hougang sampai bukit batok jauh seh
park connectors dia tampines
ya it's from tampines to pasir ris like a shortcut bagi pergi ya main basikal so
so far if kalau pergi jauh-jauh aku tak pernah aku tak pernah realize seh
ya dah ada ya dah ada
to from sun plaza park sun plaza park yang belakang
ah terus jalan terus connect to
connect to ah pasir ris lah it's a shortcut masuk pasir ris
ada ada ada err actually actually tampines street forty five yang belakang is actually connecting
dia actually connected to connected to bedok bedok reservoir err then
nowadays my school is only err usually now is only four days sahaja
now at this age nothing much to do lah so ya quite sian lah like macam like
I thought macam I thought like I thought
macam like seven eleven jobs is easy to get kan but
to work somewhere in uh plaza singapura lah plaza singapura then I can err it's
second they called me they say which ah which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza singapura then
they send my resume to plaza singapura then
they have a different way of macam approaching things lah they
people have more macam people are more more polite lah bila I talk to people
macam really down to earth they they know
east coast apa tu
aku suka pergi oh
I mean aku aku aku not the outdoor outdoor ke type of person lah aku aku tak suka
macam aku aku
err aku tak suka kotor-kotor lah aku tak suka pasir-pasir you know pasir-pasir then
memang best lah kotor-kotor ah but macam the next
day macam hari hari kemudian macam
bila time pagi nak balik you know nak balik nak kena
nak kena mandi nak kena
nak kena bersihkan pasir-pasir you know that kind of thing habis dengan
pagi-pagi buta rambut tak shampoo all that macam aku tak macam
aku tak suka outdoor punya benda because of that sahaja lah aku
oh I mean ah ya lah I think ah aku rasa it's a macam macam macam ah
apa ni self esteem dalam melayu apa eh macam
pendirian diri ah eh bukan bukan lah I don't know what lah sudah macam like
self esteem lah aku
will affect my choices macam aku will affect aku punya
err whether aku nak ikut kau orang pergi east coast overnight ke tak
so kalau aku ikut kau orang pergi east coast and aku nak overnight aku nak kena
nak kena pack barang-barang aku semua lah like like
like I've to make sure aku ada ini ada itu ada ini so besok aku will feel
maybe mungkin it's a mungkin it's a penyakit ah I don't know lah but ya lah
ya I think I think I think betul juga ah apa yang kau cakap macam like um
macam let's say macam main dekat rumput main dekat rumput kadang-kadang I mean aku
aku punya mind kan aku dah fikir pasal rumput tu kan
nanti automatic kan automatically aku punya kaki gatal sendiri tau macam
suddenly aku dah rasa dia punya gatal dia macam pasal aku
macam betul-betul ada ada betul-betul betul-betul rumput ini akan menggatalkan kaki aku lah then aku
straightaway kaki aku dah rasa gatal dulu macam
aku rasa ada something ah macam tangan aku pun kalau tangan aku
macam ada sweaty palms ah berpeluh
kalau kalau kalau aku tak fikir pasal apa-apa apa-apa eh
dia okay tau tapi bila time aku
nak start buat kerja something ke apa eh
bila time aku dah start dekat depan computer aku nak fikir lama jer kan
aku rasa straightaway tangan aku berpeluh tau so macam
dia ada effect juga ah macam
aku rasa anxiety problem ah macam
macam oh aku kena habiskan kerja ni
masa tempoh ni then straightaway aku punya otak aku dah fikir oh
dah ada macam jadi rasa takut lah
oh jadi
itu lah asyik berbual pasal aku jer daripada tadi
aku tanya pasal engkau pula lah
ya lah I mean itu lah I mean cause sekarang umur kau berapa
sudah forty kan oh ya itu lah I mean
lagi twenty ah haiya I I don't know lah macam
aku tak boleh look forward lah I mean but ya lah
cepat lah one masa berlalu very fast lah to me like my masa
a lot dah tukar lah I mean a lot of a lot of changes lah dulu singapore dulu dengan singapore sekarang kan macam a lot of changes lah cara
makin laju everything became became faster
then macam everybody rushing then macam like
aku feel last time was more um
ke time lockdown eh time lockdown I uh lockdown period I think
mm takut tak lah I mean
ya actually aku actually I I thought of that also lah I mean I I already
you know I I I decided to macam I came to
it's not something you can like belek here belek there and like go
and not get caught or what macam
ya betul ah eh I remember I remember those times lah macam
err hopeless lah you feel quite sad lah like like like macam like
macam going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship lah like
ya that one ya lah betul lah I mean I feel like macam
ah lah there are a lot of a lot of view a lot of macam views on that lah macam like
will say different things lah macam
like nature nature telling us something ke apa you know that kind of thing so
itu lah we just have to make the best of it lah
ya lah but sekarang I mean um ya definitely macam that time aku baca dekat news
aku baca dekat uh yahoo news that macam a lot of a lot of deejays yang main
a lot of like uh house deejays I mean like resident deejays yang main dekat macam
dekat fullerton dekat you know dekat
ya ya all the deejays yang spin
semua most of them out of job lah habis
from earning like macam like
like food online or online or macam food delivery online then
bars and all that lah macam whatever that has music ah
actually macam counter that thing yang is actually can survive and
ah ah if you're comparing macam like music eh audio and video right
uh right now video is important lah macam there's more video jobs like for internship like more video jobs err
ya lah so sometimes I feel like macam
would have been different lah but but ya lah macam nasib ah
mm betul itu lah that's why that's why right now
I mean ada macam I I got my school
so actually I feel honestly right now aku feel like macam want to give up lah because
macam there's no more industry there's no no more music industry right then
then I'm like in year three trying to finish my diploma in audio then macam I feel like sometimes
like want to give up lah pasal like like
you know of of course there's still macam online streaming all that lah cuma
you know netflix you know netflix sekarang they have err all the singaporean movies
everything is on the Netflix right now you know then like macam
oh is it oh tak ya ya all the way lah right now right now all the all the old singapore movies is on
okay so okay nama aku
tahun ni is uh tiga puluh tahun ah tahun ni aku tiga puluh tahun so uh untuk aku is
macam mana nak okay okay lah err maybe before that also lah
before that aku kerja dekat public utilities board lah uh it was ya you you know ah
ah bill air lah bill air
so ya so that was my first job lah ever since aku I I've I've been working there err untuk enam tahun ah so err so err
ya I I applied for err I I was quite lucky sebab
uh aku apply kerja tu and uh
ah apa ni ah aku kerja sana for enam tahun
at at that time pun
then err I also I also same like like like you lah also thinking what should I do what's my career path because honestly speaking pun at that time bila aku apply itu kerja pun
aku aku
dia bukan ah
I rather than kau dah abeh duduk rumah tak buat apa-apa kan so err so might as well
I just took took up the job lah so err when I took up the job I aku got a lot of free time and aku pun look around aku tengok kawan-kawan aku aku punya friends
so aku pun fikir I think I should also do that tapi I also I also made a mistake
like aku like follow the aku follow the
err apa ni
like in a way follow the trend bukan ikut hati bukan ikut hati sendiri ah
so or everyone's anytime at aku was like saying to myself oh everyone's furthering their studies so I should also take up a further my studies ah I didn't I I didn't really err
a degree then I I asked myself like okay what degree should I take at that time aku aku pun tak sure lah nak nak
nak ambil degree apa then aku cakap dengan diri aku okay since aku working in this line
I apa my boss
I have good relation with my boss then they they they see an opportunity in me then is err kirakan err is one way for me to progress lah
ah so as to be honest pun apa my diploma pun anytime time masuk poly pun
I just take up this course ah it wasn't err err it wasn't it wasn't like oh aku passionate about this course err aku nak nak jadi engineer no ah in it was nothing like that lah

after a few days pun it's the same it's the same thing
kau pun dah nothing much to do abeh ah like err after a few
weeks tak tak silap aku ada lagi satu engineer engineer ah engineer baru masuk engineer dia engineer baru ni masuk dia sekali pandang kau aku memang tahu lah dia ni engineer dia pun dari india juga ah
pasal the the the funny thing is
masuk site office eh dia duduk kat tempat yang aku duduk yang aku tidur tu
so he literally
took up my my my place ah kirakan dia macam ibarat ganti aku ah
so aku
at first bila dia dia datang like
the first few days dia masuk aku tak berbual dengan dia sangat ah pasal aku tak tahu dia engineer as in aku tahu dia engineer he was part of the company is an
employee of the company tapi aku didn't know his background so hari-hari ah
ah so hari-hari aku datang office aku tengok dia pun dia pun macam aku time baru masuk dia datang office duduk office pun duduk
so aku pun aku tanya dia ah I ah pasal
ah kita attachment semua kita nak kena err put up a report apa kita punya own individual report
so aku
ah aku pun need someone to to to give me some input ah like all these technical technical details apa kita buat apa benda yang bangla bangla
dia orang yang tengah bikin apa benda yang dia orang tengah bikin so I need someone to explain to me ah so aku tahu dia ni engineer he's part of the company tapi dia pun tak ada kerja dia pun macam aku
aku tanya dia lah aku just take the opportunity ah aku tanya excuse me are you an engineer
so that explains a lot lah kenapa dia dia macam aku duduk lepak aje tak sebab dia punya project belum start lagi so that's why the the company
I asked him to to come over to this project first sambil tunggu the his project start lah
so aku
dengar gitu aku like okay ah aku punya mind macam terus ada light bulb ah okay bagus ah aku boleh boleh apa
ah minta tolong dia untuk aku punya report ah individual report ah
terus aku aku korek ah help me tell me what is this explain to me what is that gini semua abeh dia dia bilang ah
abeh after that day onwards pun
err dia dengan aku sekaki ah err err dia pun selalu come let's go let's go out jalan-jalan err pergi keluar jalan-jalan pun ni ah jadi orang tak tak
tak tengok kita tak buat apa-apa ah ah
asal tak tidur dekat sana ada got some certain days certain days we kita ada tidur kat kat ah kat tempat situ kadang-kadang pasal we did an upgrading project in a apa
kadang-kadang pun kita ah apa jalan-jalan dalam sekolah dia kita tidur dalam classroom that was during the holidays lah so the school was empty ah
kirakan err the
dekat site eh
yang paling tinggi is only the project manager lah and project manager that time aku punya project manager perempuan so ah she also
err wasn't the the macam mana nak cakap eh ah
there there are some ladies who are macam rude ah dia orang dia orang can do both the office work and the site work tapi yang that time aku punya internship my project manager she was more of the office type lah
so dia duduk office aje ah kalau higher ups ni semua ah dia orang jarang datang site
at most pun dia orang datang ah apa once err
dia orang pun tak akan dia orang pun tak akan macam err
ya probably they want kalau dia orang pergi site pun nak tengok progress you won't go into
macam dalam-dalam ah dia orang setakat jalan dekat tepi tengok oh okay ini dah siap ini dah bangun ini dah bikin dia orang tak akan masuk like literally masuk
aku so the good thing the the engineer came aku minta dia tolong so like
aku pun help to update my my weekly report
okay lah aku
uh one good thing pun aku pun like have to be smart also lah macam aku pun tahu office orang semua
cakap aku aku datang pun tak buat apa-apa kan so bila bila this engineer dah datang aku dah dapat dia tolong uh aku punya report
so bila-bila aku nak kena bikin report aku buat dalam office ah I mean that's the only place also yang aku boleh buat apa
that's like like that's that's the only setting yang kau boleh buat kerja apa
so ada juga lah there's there's where other engineer pun start to notice ah wah dia ni ada juga ah bikin ni bikin ni buat ni semua pasal like a few weeks later ada lagi satu budak
attachment masuk
ah budak attachment ah
dia pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office pasal it's just like a very ah small ah small office
so hari-hari kau datang office eh kita masuk kita punya site office sebelum masuk kau nak kena buka kasut kau ah
so satu hari tu aku aku macam biasa report late to work
aku sampai office aku tengok kat luar pintu
pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office kau dah kau dah cam ah kau dah cam ah ah
ah ni kasut dia ni ni kasut dia tu
eh hari ni datang ada kasut baru ah ni ada budak attachment baru ke okay ah ada member ah siol aku ingatkan
local poly ke apa ah local student aku dah excited ah at least ada member eh pasal kau hari-hari kerja pun muka muka sama mendak ah
sekali aku buka pintu masuk office buda china ah siol
dia dia err and he he's he's not from a local polytechnic lah he
bukan bukan he's he's a he's he's from china tapi dia punya course is from
err err err apa ni err building construction authority kirakan macam mana nak cakap eh
ah macam
okay ah it's to put it simply macam
ah aku
aku masuk fire fire fighting apa eh
dia orang ada separate course apa fire fighting course eh macam
tapi untuk building building punya sector ah kirakan aku masuk ni course
aku dari poly tapi untuk some students hantar
ah so so okay ah dia so bila aku nampak dia alamak budak china pula eh aku ingatkan pasal kau tahu
at that aku tak tahu lah sekarang still I think now still the same tapi back then
they couldn't speak english well lah and then they they just speak mandarin to you aku pun dah ibarat macam
err apa macam ayam dengan itik ah berbual
so okay lah  aku ingatkan ah okay lah at least ni ada attachment ada budak attachment okay lah
ah err just talk ah pasal
apa everyday pun got nothing much apa so just try to strike up a conversation
err strike a conversation pun like he doesn't really understand what I'm trying to say pun aku pun tak berapa faham
aku pun tahu like he doesn't really get me so okay lah just just
just err or just hi bye gitu ah
but the funny thing was apa ni
dia lagi apa eh err
dia lagi lagi laid back dari aku ah siol
a'ah ah dia lagi lepak dari aku lah siol
dia like literally
bukan nak kata aku like the model student ah aku pun aku pun ada juga ah memang ah aku lepak ah tapi aku pun err you have to be smart ah kau tak boleh
err macam selalu err apa err
tunjuk orang kau you have to balance it out ah
macam aku bukan aku hari-hari pula err datang datang office lambat
ah so aku aku hari ever since office boy dah dah macam cover aku eh office boy dah dah macam
ah dia dah tolong tolong aku aku tiap-tiap hari datang office lambat
pasal aku tahu aku dah tahu dia punya timing bila aku datang office tak ada orang dalam office so selalu aku datang bila tak ada orang dalam office
ah ah tapi when
when it comes to bila kau nak tunjuk muka ah then kau
tunjuk muka ah
ah so you you just have to be smart about it ah tapi yang this this other guy like he literally like
err dia punya suka ah
dia ah
dia dia the good thing untuk aku aku ada orang cover aku the office boy
like you have to make you use you have to network ah you have to network you had to make connections tapi dia ni dia ni tak ada connections langsung ah ah
ah office boy approach tapi language barrier juga ah
apa dia pun in his own world even the the other engineers
the malaysian chinese enigineers pun dia orang pun cakap dia ni
apa dia ni tak boleh ah dia ni buat hal sendiri
apa so so that's that's the thing ah
that was my experience lah for my for my attachment so it was from that experience yang aku tengok
eh siala rabak apa aku tengok the working environment macam it's so stressful aku tengok the the engineer yang dari india tu kiwak muka dah macam zombie
tapi untuk aku ya aku was just a student apa so aku just report to work like the usual like eight thirty to six something like that lah aku macam mana pun
pukul enam aku chao ah pasal they they don't really have have anything much for me apa tapi like those engineers like
dia orang after six pun dia orang still
err ya so abeh aku tengok like the work environment macam
semua orang buat hal sendiri macam not much interaction
like ya it's true err aku can understand they don't take me seriously and aku pun wasn't expecting them to take me seriously ah aku kau cakap gini pun aku teringat ada satu kali tu it was the first tak silap aku the first day ah the first day

after the experience aku was like siala gini rabak pe err
so err err lepas bila aku tu tu yang aku pun make me
fikir ah I like aku betul like sial ah betul ke nak kerja err construction industry rabak gini
tapi at that at that at that time pun macam abeh kalau aku tak nak kerja construction industry pun aku nak kerja apa sia
abeh aku fikir-fikir abeh aku dah belajar ambil diploma ni pun dah dah dah tiga tahun takkan nak
okay lah cakap dengan diri
aku even though aku
aku still don't know what to do with my life since aku already have this diploma which already err took up three years of my life okay lah I just just might as well take up a job
aku ya aku applied for
which I applied ah ni I applied the stat boards public utilities board ni semua so okay lah alhamdulillah err within one or two weeks they get back to me and aku got the job quite quite fast ah
um ya apa time aku
ya bila aku dapat kerja pun like
pasal like err when I join the company
then they because it's a big company apa so they have this apa induction course ah
it's no longer your your your age age age group ah so you meet all kinds of people lah abeh abeh jumpa abang-abang ni semua apa
oh engkau umur berapa
ah ya ya around your age ah oh muda lagi ni kau punya ni kau punya ah first kerja aku cakap a'ah
oh apa kau patut
err muda-muda patut kerja luar dulu kerja private apa rasa dia punya susah payah dulu err kau dah kau dah tahu dia punya susah payah baru kau masuk
baru kau masuk err
government state board ni semua you know lah because they see government iron rice bowl which is true lah definitely I I won't I won't a dispute that ah
and uh so when they when they say that aku pun like eh
alamak aku pun did I make the right move ke tak eh err err like
you were saying ah kau
a fresh fresh graduate baru baru baru baru graduate ini semua kau patut
err kirakan start from the bottom ah start from scratch
bila aku happy kerja
and aku pun so it it gave me like
err doubts lah aku pun like
did I make the right move ke tak eh
tapi I mean
apa it doesn't really matter also lah
just went along lah abeh macam
aku pun fikir balik like
err ya what he say really err apa like
ah tak bedek ah but
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks ah abeh aku pun fikir balik macam sial ah aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak resign oh just
because aku nak nak nak listen to that guy kan
uh apa uh
I mean apa you
you just made do with what you have ah you just make do with what you have memang betul
apa the the at that at that time my my nature of work
err apa
it didn't turn out quite that bad also pasal
macam you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants ah so
abeh err from
from aku punya nature of work pun project management pun what what I
back then pun aku wasn't really a
a a apa ni I'm
I am a very quiet guy lah aku not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
so so ya you aku aku
improve on my soft skills and then dekat err during my course of work pun there like what I told you ah who decided to further my studies take up
like I told you before lah apa aku time ambil degree pun was like
doing a degree I should also do a degree tapi
uh aku was just following the trend ah tapi now now aku fikir balik I shouldn't have do that lah I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
and uh what you really want to do ah pasal that time
apa err
since you say it like that pada aku in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in ah so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay um which I agree lah which a degree is not really ah apa a need ah
when aku did my degree uh
err aku did my degree while while working kan abeh as years go by eh
aku kat kerja aku like
aku tengok aku punya sama ah like
work environment pun
aku tell myself sial ah aku aku aku don't see myself
aku tengok aku punya bosses eh like
macam err
dia orang ada takde pun macam beza sia
like they are just like pasal okay
organisation kan like ya we have a apa like uh
tapi stat board they call it lah
when kau pun pun you should know ah kan hierarchy ah it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like abeh macam
kau kat bawah eh macam
tak boleh buat decision abeh kau nak kena
err lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena
abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu decision orang atas dia lagi
I mean kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka
like apa sia ni like
kau orang err kau orang cannot make a decision abeh aku nak kena buat apa siol
bertahun-tahun lepas punya sia
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like eh siala kau orang dari dulu eh abeh sampai sekarang
more like pada aku it's not healthy ah abeh abeh macam aku like kat situ eh aku kerja situ like siala macam aku kalau stay sini aku tak nak sia end up macam kau orang ya I mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true ah aku
dispute it lah apa err government really iron rice bowl lah as in like
but aku just don't see myself doing that long term ah
to to change line ah aku decided to go into aku wanted to do media so
err after my apa ni err my degree ended
aku graduated
aku took out a course dekat mediacorp
at first aku didn't know about it also like as in I I do
ah apa sebelum aku enroll under mediacorp
ya I I did some I did some research ah of courses of media courses ah apa that's where aku like macam aku menyesal lah siala like instead of me doing this degree in project management I should have like straightaway
it's good lah it's good lah uh so aku was like err apa siala aku tahu dulu aku
and then apa that was
this school ah aku dah aku dah lupa ah nama sekolah dia ke something like that it was it is it closed down already ah
ah something like that ah aku pun dah lupa ah
then apa ni so aku just still err
to go ahead with it aku look up ada ada aku aku just look up on google lah of of ah media courses ah abeh aku fikir balik ah macam
aku baru habis aku punya part-time degree aku did my part-time degree for five years
aku dah like that five years eh aku pun like like like macam in a way like macam drag myself to to finish it ah
abeh err
lepas tu aku sekarang nak go into media industry kalau aku nak ambil degree aku nak kena
aku was like siala five years of study dah dah macam dah cukup ah like ah enough of studying ah sia ah enough of studying ah I mean
ah abeh
aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak take up another degree
another three years of degree for media abeh aku just look out aku tengok mediacorp offer offer
this is but it's a diploma ah it's just a one year course okay lah one year aku cakap dengan dia okay lah masih boleh take it lah one year okay lah so I I I I grabbed it ah
then err aku pun
transition into the media industry kan so aku like thought of err maybe err take a gap year first ah before aku joined the media industry
so uh apa aku
was planning to take my gap year which was this year aku uh already plan to go to new zealand
a working holiday if you heard of it ah basically I basically it's it's a holiday tapi ah
kau boleh you can apply for a job there
but ah but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs lah it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs ataupun part-time jobs are those kind of jobs ah ya ah so
so err apa ni err
kalau there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
pasal ah their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they make use of this err apa ni err backpackers foreigners to come to to to err holiday
and err at the same time these people need money to continue their holiday apa so they make use of this people to work in the horticulture industry ah so aku
aku dah plan ah aku dah book aku apa flight semua aku dah aku dah err dah dapat dah visa aku dah apa ni err aku dah apply deferment pun untuk aku punya
semua dah settle semua dah swee tinggal nak
nak ni je nak naik flight jer
ya I mean it's it's it's predictable lah apa aku punya kerja pula aku nak kena bagi one month notice so err apa ah
aku decided to like literally ah resign err one month before aku punya flight ah aku tak nak resign too early pasal aku pun need the money lah
I have over there apa
so aku pun decided to like just err retire one month before my flight
aku was seriously like the the suspense eh was like wow like only
apa err
when the news all broke out oh apa COVID
ni semua apa ah
at first macam the whole the whole world were were singing praises for singapore oh singapore have their best system they have the best ini itu ini semua gedebak gedebuk tapi aku dalam hati macam okay lah aku harap that like
err maybe err new zealand they dia orang like closed one eye on singapore because
kononnya singapore have a very good system in controlling the the virus they will still allow err err visitors to come over lah
sekali but unfortunately that
did not happen ah aku punya
ah apa
ah three weeks before my flight ah so at that time when they announced that aku dah already tender my notice aku dah resign pun
ah abeh like fuck man at that time like siala macam damn when when when that news came out eh aku rasa macam like like rasa macam bodoh ah like ah
not really cheated macam
ya ya ya err abeh macam
betul lah I mean
it's not my fault tapi like I really felt stupid at that time ah macam damn like like aku like aku pun dah bilang err aku punya boss semua like aku didn't like literally at my workplace inform all my colleagues oh I'm going new zealand ni semua like macam macam excitingly like break the news to them ah
aku like just keep it to myself lah tapi of course dengan aku punya boss aku nak kena bilang dia apa aku aku nak resign ni semua
abeh boss aku pun of course they they dia orang pun tanya aku kau betul ke nak resign apa ah
at that time pun pernah tanya aku if aku nak reconsider ke tak resignation aku aku cakap tak ah aku still want to go ahead
he respect my decision ah dia cakap okay ah this is your decision I fully respect your decision if you really want to go you just go ahead lah okay lah so when the news broke out that new zealand they close the borders aku like fuck man like siala ah
dah aku dah tender aku punya resignation abeh semua dah dah dah settle flights semua dah settle logistics semua settle
habis sekarang tak jadi eh aku dah then err the the other things that came into my mind ni ah sekarang macam mana takde kerja takde kerja abeh like
tak dapat pergi like a lot of things came into my mind ah
apa like
at that time was like really down ah really down abeh ah
aku didn't work for four months
ya ah apa
ah kau cakap pasal tu pun err apa
was at its peak ah aku punya office dalam office aku tu that same floor one of the one of the office lady
okay lah quite close so at that time pun like eh siala macam
err apa a lot of err uncertainty a lot of
err suspense ah like eh macam mana ni eh apa aku pun risau aku pun takut jangan aku positive sudah abeh nanti aku tak dapat pergi like you have
ah nasib baik ya lah eventually the lady she recovered from COVID and none of the office staff on my floor were tested positive also lah as in we we didn't we we didn't have to at that time belum ada swab test ah
so anytime we just ah apa do uh uh fourteen day quarantine at home
so uh alhamdulillah tak ada apa-apa
aku resign then aku didn't work for four months the first two months aku like literally like
lepak kat rumah ah aku like literally no mood ah aku just err err new zealand tak jadi kan ah just duduk rumah ah aku aku like laze laze around at home ah
uh aku rasa wishes ni mesti lebih realistik lah tak boleh yang merepek-merepek lah okay kalau realistik wishes aku rasa aku nak get rich lah one of it lah one of it maybe untuk get rich
the reason aku nak kaya pasal actually err aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan
then kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi fit ah aku nak jadi fit aku fit aku rasa macam aku pergi lari ah err dekat bedok reservoir ke macritchie ke I feel that uh my body feels good lah so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
superpower okay so err we are moving from realistic to not so realistic ah okay so superpower kalau boleh aku nak teleportation teleportation kalau tengok cerita X men eh dia sikit-sikit macam night crawler
err so kalau teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
um to a certain extent pasal lah tu err bila teleportation okay kononnya tak ada teleportation eh macam sekarang ni
kita dah kena expose more err how should I say it uh more unknowingly for example kita naik kita squeeze squeeze dekat
kalau kita squeeze squeeze naik atau naik taxi grab driver ke taxi driver ke ah kita expose in that uh area kita duduk kat dalam ke kat dalam kereta ke
untuk beberapa minit ini ah ada yang research cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang
jadi kalau ada measure measure contohnya macam uh sanitisation
let's say nak pergi giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
and I rest at work and exposed again ini tak boleh kalau kita dah teleportation teleportation kita skip all the buses ni semua ah all the transportation ini exposure
ah tak kan begitu
but then when this err banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan mm apa ni orang kata
kena pergi kursus ah kursus-kursus um macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer
menggunakan aplikasi word excel kenapa teknologi telah berubah
jadi mereka dah behind time so ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin okay kut
okay lah eh jap err kita err
saya teringat something ah yang pasal teleportation ah kita uh ni eh reverse sikit ah eh teleportation eh kononnya teleportation ni kan boleh kita boleh teleport
um bila kita umur sepuluh tahun
uh kira-kira ni macam so called macam time machine begitu ah uh macam advance yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya invention tapi tak tahu lah dah ada ke tidak ni
uh jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh teleport reverse time eh maybe kita teleport ten years old
nak cakap apa dengan awak punya uh diri tu okay kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia
err salah satu err experience yang aku pernah mengalami ah adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit lah ah tapi dia real ah
dia err it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving uh at tioman
bulu roma ternaik ah bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku
jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga so err saya tengah bawa macam biasa
tiba-tiba err saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan err di road tersebut lah di jalan raya tersebut
jadi err bila saya bawa
the person a a driver the driver that uh was err almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily err nothing happen tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja
tapi itu pun okay itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa
ah itu adalah uh experience saya lah yang near death experience or rather I would say a near miss ah how about you furqan
oho dah macam pantun berkerat
yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen uh yang tu semua lah uh dia orang kerja trip
lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut number of trip kalau dia orang
kan kurang lah gaji dia orang ah mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya err sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak
err lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin err anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa jer lah dia punya dia punya alasannya err

okay okay ya singapore kecil apa statewide sia
actually singapore if you know kalau kita nak divide into you want to think as if of state right how would it be though
you know prior to his discovery of singapore right malaysia doesn't exist apa
ya no pasal dulu orang melayu banyak like the population is a lot
but then what happened what telah happen
eh but we should go makan soon ah lama tak makan sia like proper punya makan
eh bro I almost selalu tengok confirm like almost everyday ah aku pergi YouTube then search burger ke or like steak punya cooking videos
dorang like starting jer the they got all the items or like at first you know they buy all these kind of stuff then as
quite sick ah that one then I got see yang dorang restore dia punya samurai punya sword kan sick sia
oh that one actually kena ada license ah dulu dulu when secondary school tak payah aku tahu kau tahu Otaku House
dulu kan
tak dulu ada dulu secondary school aku dengan kawan aku selalu pergi beli macam
like your whole kampung can stay there
like you can just say hi mak
dekat sebelah like your mother house like literally dekat sebelah but you get your own house
nak ada apa durian rambutan
it's like so besar aiyoyo boleh jadi gila besar dia
is like must be besar lah kalau if it's like macam
kecil I mean like all singapore houses is like so small so kecil
a rumah sebesar
ah betul juga eh ya how come I never thought of that no but then like susah seh kalau macam
staycation tapi staycation masih like around singapore pe
besar ah rumah dia
so it's not made up of kayu you know like last time like they always made up of kayu
you like kayu or you like concrete
you got stay in kayu house before
never ee kentalnya
you know what they call that rumah panggung
that's why like malaysia I don't know eh malaysia like jarang seh
splinter nanti ada splinter then like mak tolong mak ada splinter
mak kau marah sia
north is like uh tempat macam sembawang ah yishun all the atas atas
what is happening there tak ada benda actually okay if you put right uh
okay you think about dia punya benda-benda yang ada dekat sana
nak migrate pergi mana
or to danga bay ya they've got pool you can just go out of the fray a bit I thought they are both right ni
jauh for what
north pun jauh seh
I think the red line super panjang seh dia punya dia punya line macam never ending
you daripada marsiling pergi
after the next stop after marsiling dia macam rasa macam forever dia just tak sampai-sampai macam
nama dia dekat like if you see the listing kan nama dia
tak tahu ha I don't know I don't what is it
oh ya balestier untuk orang kaya tau
untung lah ya man
landed mahal seh landed
wah so expensive seh I really tak sanggup like
kalau nak beli like the four room lah
ya like I would macam spend the
tak tak muai seh
wah like inflation ini semua inflation
empat ratus something empat ratus million juta no I don't think it's billion billion
banyak kan
boleh rent out
I think can make my own kilang
kecoh sia ya
macam oh aku ada kawan kat sana tak ya
tak ya book apa airbnb ke
and then some more you stay at the like two three storey house seram seh
because the currency also lain jadi macam
cost of living kalau if we kalau kita kerja kat sana
err you can also cause kita like we planning to get at woodlands so it's like woodlands area is just so near to then she say so aku kata like you beli rumah dekat woodlands
err you all err rasa macam you all save enough money to beli rumah dekat err
then you all just beli rumah dekat abeh rent out the rumah dekat err singapore ah dekat woodlands
abeh nanti orang cakap like imagine satu rumah like seven hundred dollars
satu rumah eh seven hundred dollars
satu bilik seven hundred dollars up to eight hundred fifty dollars
sebab tempat dia kat woodlands
and then after that then you times like let's say the rumah that I want to go for is empat bilik
no dekat singapore ah so seven hundred uh times four
so one month you earn two thousand eight you never even kerja
so like two thousand eight abeh dah tu you convert the money to malaysia
ah tak payah kerja seh
okay so like rumah kan dia ada ninety nine years lease
so kalau freehold that means like you can stay there forever and ever you can go generation
jadi dia macam forever and ever jadi
let's say ada anak cucu cicit
then dah tu sebab dia orang dah ada the rumah
then they can just like rent the rumah then they can just buy another house because it's like
like they have like macam a certain like oh you can only okay if let's say you are a diploma then you can only earn like two five
two five abeh you need to expect to buy a house with the two five
so ya like macam susah seh and you like
apa namanya apa after diploma ah degree
ya after degree abeh setakat macam dapat like a three hundred dollar raise like a starting pay of two eight
why I mean like sedih you know like cause some people like they don't have the money to even pay for a degree
abeh dah tu like you expect like
kita to hustle sama
untuk macam dapat the same
everybody standard like that is the price of the house to the house tapi ni macam
sebab kita punya level is lain
so macam
buat cantik ah resume tu buat cantik cantik swee swee ke
degree is like macam dia punya baru punya in thing tau
ah sabar two five
wow banyak pe
dia boleh pergi mana overseas dia pergi mana
sabar labrador park
okay apa apa lah tak tau
dah kata degree
oh shit mahal seh
tunda lah beli rumah tak akan beli
aduh peningnya kepala
tiga puluh ah tiga puluh
tapi tiga puluh lelaki tak ada masalah seh
oh ya ya ya betul betul betul betul
eh but I think like the trend kan sekarang is like
semua orang boleh jadi independent like girl dengan girl like guy girl is girl guy is guy and like
if I wanna like work towards something like I work hard for it ah and then after that then err kalau macam
nak slack off
so I think the zaman dah berubah change already
now zaman sekarang orang
like perempuan like like girls
the guy's pride the maruah of the guy which is like
I mean like sometimes it's tak boleh avoid
for satu for one person to kerja
macam mana nak cakap macam sole breadwinner ya like it's impossible like
tapi commission pun tak stable seh
satu hari like you can like satu bulan you can only earn like macam tiga ribu abeh the next bulan you earn lima ribu
lagi like COVID I think COVID nineteen was a good example like
then macam wah so difficult that's why like I think susah kalau like you based on like
apa nama dia commission jer
tapi dia buat satu kerja jer pe
so so dia punya pay tetap dua ribu lima ratus atau the pay already
because sekarang dia ambil orang lain punya commission
abeh like
oh no okay so wait her pay dua ribu lima ratus
abeh dah tu kalau sebab sekarang dia ada commission kawan dia so how ever much the commission
of dia punya kawan let's say satu ribu then after that dengan dia punya satu ribu
oh okay okay faham faham
she untung ah
branches cawangan
okay faham faham faham faham
dia tu lah
tak ada hospitalisation leave eh
lagi banyak kerja lah
ah kalau let's say the future
like lagi teruk macam mana
betul betul betul betul rabak ah macam betul betul macam for a moment kan
macam mana okay okay okay
how can the anak tak put aside
dia tak buat financial tu eh
kan mak gitu
tak boleh seh like
like tak ada hati nak
macam dia orang dah cakap beforehand ah
ah eh okay mak nak my mother is doing that you know
I just want it to be like a simple one then after that dia cakap ah tak apa ah kak mak nak buat err kampung tak apa tu mak bayar
as the daughter I feel macam tak sedap apa like how can
how can I macam ask my mother to pay for
kat singapore boleh lah tapi kalau dekat macam indonesia tak perlu seh then you want to do like at indonesia
banyak seh
nak ah
combine ke tak combine
cause like you know like mum thing you like if you want you wouldn't want to friend to like you know like macam to share the habitats defence
sometimes they have like parents like ada dia punya own wish
okay lah tak larang kalau dia nak buat buat lah kalau ada duit tak ada duit nevermind
nasib baik got save save kalau tak save then like teruk sia macam gitu
sabar after like a certain period of time ke apa
ah ya lah macam insurance ah no it's not insurance it's investment
ya so kalau investment dia macam
okay so at the after twenty five years I keluarkan the duit
I keluarkan the duit like after twenty five years ah so
ya times the months and then after that dah tu dia punya interest ah
ah macam gitu
but ni semua masing-masing ah ya masing-masing like
sepuluh tahun up to you ah like what you want lor
ya we all macam
you know they can err uh masing-masing ah
kalau tak okay tak okay ah like sesuka hati ah
kau tahu recently kan aku fikir I was thinking to get macam a new job cause I'm like freaking jobless right now

oh oh ya ya twenty eighteen aku nineteen correct
there see that guy macam that guy is the singapore social guy kan then she she was like
shu shu is my err my ex-colleague the one that is now working for berita harian as the
reporter actually the other day I I forgot lah that kak ain kan she just macam she just err wrote a new book right the java enigma
then after that she got the I err I was talking to her then like dia dapat the interview dengan berita harian right err
taking scraps ah from her colleagues so like quite I forgot about dia for a bit
oh ya anyway next time macam you kalau dengar like any like cool people or stories or people to interview ah just let me know ah then at least she has something to write about
okay so katakan dia is like twenty four twenty one years old twenty one years old
masih you will still consider
abang she's twenty one this year and you are twenty nine this year
katakan lah I I know someone who is twenty one years old this year and
anyway I was talking to kakak the other day she was asking whether she want to
belum but she she did tell me macam
err dia no lah dia ada make like ada make video lah like when she
um okay lah it's very big then dia ada macam err dua balconies two balconies
based on macam the video I saw it was macam dua dua balconies
I was talking to her then on the day yang err
kakak was err just mengumpat pasal dia punya
err mak mertua as per usual lah the usual err
topic of conversation between mummy kakak and the madrina
ya so then mummy was saying macam kakak is
the what's that anak mertua yang biadap I think that was the exact words err
that is a mm adjective to to describe kakak
but anyway err um remember kakak I was asking kakak when she
err celebrate hari raya in her current house
or celebrate hari raya in the next house because
eh no it should be may it should be may cause this year's hari raya was err dua puluh empat
I remember the hari raya was
dua puluh empat or dua puluh enam I think that was the
that was the official hari raya punya date
no lah as in just kakak was asking me lah macam mana cause
like kasi orang jalan jalan raya lah to her house
ya ya ya I I remember is the one yang abang yan dengan yang abang yan datang then he
yes yes is that is that one that one yang dia err minta kakak izin like err
kakak kata okay lah obviously but kakak was like cause what cause kakak couldn't say macam
no tak boleh datang kau tak boleh datang besok but like kakak was like okay
kenapa ni nak datang then I remember mum was saying macam dia tak ada barang tak ada benda lain tak buat apa
then macam why why then mum was telling the story of how he always goes to people's houses
ah ya ya I heard that he's doing it and cik anis is also doing it right was it
how old is abang yan again
suka hati eh abang just panggil orang gay eh
sangat deep
macam best sangat ke
bagus sangat ke ah ugh it doesn't happen in
there's macam everybody is more free and liberal in
for right okay I know that kalau you nak masuk kalau you nak dapatkan the hostel room right
yang the korean punya show yang dia orang taruk the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
kejar them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
like other celebrities have to chase them and cari I believe they have to pull the name tag off lah
she like it was very popular so I remember me and kakak we were saying that
but last time dia punya zaman also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball dengan football T-shirt
last time we used to have this err music teacher kat bowen ah his name was err mister jamal
like professional macam
dia punya club room he
either he's kekek like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers punya basketball punya like
ya so macam the husband must be really making serious money ah
macam tak masuk akal lah like
and it's not that there's anything wrong with kerja kerja lah but
you're so macam
supply chain abang a job that is quite a big need in singapore
exactly so macam tak masuk akal lah macam
those macam how they rank the
hundred shares bonds ah you have to like buy by the thousands ah if I'm not mistaken so macam you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
but ya lah it just doesn't makes sense to me that dah dah dah belajar susah-susah then macam
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that mamat the his boyfriend
he was quite against macam he liked to look down on a lot of this macam people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this macam
the halal version of jack's restaurant lah there was one at
it's the steak one I remember the there's a halal one made by this chef then he had a
I believe it is or it's just err something like jack's but it's halal
then the mother is back there then he is here lah then the father remarried then I think like the father macam
dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit lah like the father
like macam it doesn't make sense lah and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from wei xiang wei xiang told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
lemon yogurt you tak you tak ingat eh
you don't macam
macam bodoh lah macam don't don't jangan lah pakai your own freaking like
so so macam I was telling like him ah that
they they don't want to macam speak out against like gay people because like
like people don't want to macam oh actually she's a liar and all these ya
a lot lah I tell you right all these macam people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like dee kosh is quite stupid lah in my mind macam
you're famous kau famous macam like people know people people know your face then
kau buat macam gini macam you want to proposition right don't use your own account lah
pakai macam pakai fake account lah gini pakai your own account macam you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for macam like someone is
because macam
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to macam
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough macam
so same for dee kosh ah macam just because you you
doesn't like make it right lah you should own self macam
first of all right there is no budak zaman sekarang you and me right are difference by five years only
okay first of all right it's not budak-budak zaman sekarang there are people your age right
what rothschild what those other like err rockefeller and those macam
lauder the the family that still owns the that owns the Estee Lauder punya line the lauder family
all your shakes macam
so ya so macam
I'm a foodie so macam
you know what this reminds me okay no no no ingat tak mummy kan kata macam she said that
the I think wak nia right was just posting so much about her life on the like
WhatsApp group chat so mummy was saying macam sia annoying lah macam um kenapa nak buat macam gini
mm people yang yang nak attention lah yang yang yang gila gila attention so much ah that's what mum was saying macam
people yang like you know macam
huh they gila kan lelaki no macam they crazy for attention lah like they they
I I would be quite interested in like what is macam joe rogan's punya like
that he has fights to macam to announce ah like
what does he do like what is there macam preps that he have to do does he actually have to like research on
and then because of that dia upset mengamuk
but we always also carry what angkat jer pe
oh ya makcik seth ya so apparently seh couldn't do work properly ya and then and then got send out and then got send away that's why we wanted to came out why barang-barang semua tak betul kan
ah I mean if you really want you can but I think dia masih qualify lah
she's married what ya but she's she's married kan so kalau dia married but the husband is is B
so dia boleh declare berapa banyak dia nak apa you cannot
in which even if no matter what amount she puts because for us it's below five hundred kasi dia susah report to company
no but she going to class A so mama said will be like not so busy so most probably since dia ah
dia layan orang punya karenah ya
mama bear tak datang mama bear tak datang niari
tan sri ada tan sri mm
I think tak ada orang
it will just selalu on macam gitu but I don't think there's anybody
clement leave yes and then darlene tak ada
colin tak ada colin he's on leave also no no no not colin siapa tu no thomas
for the company he volunteered kena kena volunteered lah
no I was through home then okay lah cause my wife kerja malam today
seven thirty so kira since I'm not going to see her tonight you see so just make it one day and then we just spend the whole day together
did my bookings for my staycation pan pac because my friend dia celebrating
no because my friend did err is doing ah his daughter's birthday party kat situ like the same one I did for my son ya so like eh like he's some relative also like staying over lah they actually asked us to I think just they book dua bilik back to back because the the room can actually you know you book it together
the rooms actually always separate there's outside door yang you boleh tutup then you can remove the bilik macam besar so that's what I did during combined but I think they are doing something like that actually they just said to just sleepover
no lah then ask us to stay over for dua malam mesti dia ada ya so we so we booked a room on the twenty first twenty second monday tuesday ya the celebration is on sunday so sunday stay over then monday morning we check in
early check in ah I've been there before no no the pools were but dia limited so you need to book when you're there lah so basically ah I want to go to the pool do you have any like
so ada kitchenette ada apa no no I don't know that's my friend
endorse then present it on saturday tu saturday ya cause saturday we got video shoot with suhaimi yusof
err there's a lot of groups lah yeah sheik alauddin group he sea games ya I mean he's like the he was like he's like the same like fandi ahmad he was the first melayu who got the spot ah so called went on international platform
and stuff but when it comes to sheik questionable ah there are but not a lot there's not a lot ajak-ajak ayam but now my
then kadang-kadang like copy paste copy paste apasal ni tak copy paste to me it's oh ya ya you use Macbook that's why I think I did use Mac computer before last time when I was working for this one company
ya something like no dia punya urat hati dia putus
sedih kan
it's only like what time tu
dua belas eh tiga belas
his parents used to stay two ah levels up from my rumah lama in west coast
so in a way I think we we were like we were so called growing up playing together when younger after that we went our own ways then dah tak apparently we meet back in the same school so that's why I know the whole family so the brother passed away one year after
I don't really need I mean sometimes I envy tau orang yang macam they got friends basically hang out with school friends but for me I don't because actually after my O-levels after so I just went my own ways then just like did my ya cause I wasn't really that close to my secondary school friends
even my friends also okay lah last time we were closed always hang out but then now like those around my batch and stuff everyone is like doing their own things so we like so we like one down do our own stuff if we meet up we meet up because of whatever reason on that day my friend's father passed away then macam like jumpa gitu jer lah like you know
I think so it was baju merah maybe dia maybe dia datang bulan lah eh no it's not august
no ah but it's so red what from the first one jatuh jatuh jatuh
ya I also like to like shutdown restart cabut today was a bit okay no lah it's working you just need to like reset your

but at least orang dia kan sopan santun eh it's real you find like a malay guy like so well-mannered soft spoken like that
unless he swings the other way very unlikely he's married ya so like so and still very macam courteous sopan santun or maybe because coming here applying so macam baik kan selalu kat rumah ya kesian
the kata orang tu nak jadi jadi jer lah
because there was this one ah there's this one scene so dia cakap
that's why we are quick to change will be like okay lah takpe lah it's okay dah dah takdir
jodoh tak ke mana jodoh tak ke mana mmhmm

it's not even ten sabar lah but then kalau dia belum buka macam mana
agaknya it's because of tadi tak yang orang tu beli pokka abeh dorang masuk oh no it's us also
so kalau banyak merah maknanya tak boleh maybe because we are enclosed
jauhnya oh masih ada I think it's because we are enclosed so like the sound like bounces bounces
tapi like rambut tak terbuka
ya lah fashion kenapa merah-merah eh

itu dia wow
okay lah semoga
oh ya maybe it's spike up because you wearing earpiece jaga diri dalam kesihatan
it's only ten eh makcik it's like eh kau ada meeting kan

izin kan aku kembali kepadamu
like I said maybe it's time for you to have ipad maybe beli lagi baru punya
why is it cheaper in hawaii I think if I'm not wrong in the states only a few state is like no no not hawaii there's some states also pun murah because that time when I was err playing my nintendo street right so there are some things that you need to buy there are some games you need to purchase in online store so
maybe dorang dua tak jadi
which I am quite okay about also tak ada gambar
no kebiasaan
oh kena hantar
ah tak lah aku dengar apa ni
laki negro ni dia cakap
cam first dates semua tak mahu bawa apa ni macam makan semua just bawa jalan-jalan lepak tu macam wow betul lah pasal kalau
macam dia press for more nanti macam nampak lah what kind of person she is but ni semua orang dorang dorangnya alpha punya fikiran lah
aku keluar dengan kau ingat aku keluar dengan mimi kan tak pernah bayar apa-apa
tu ah cakap perempuan kalau gini dia boleh makan for free seven days straight boleh jumpa
but one thing aku agree dengan dia kan
macam baru kau kenal kan
she belongs to the street unless korang official about the status
macam kau tahu orang cakap macam kalau kau pergi date
kau fuck around pe gini macam suka hati dia ah
so like you have no right to like cakap dia slut ke apa kalau boleh meet sesiapa kau nak kasi dia banyak choice siapa dia nak as long there's no official status
dia berbual pasal ni kan
oh betul
ah ada yang kau pernah dengar this guy nama stephen top
tak stephen something ah some black guy dia tak believe in macam relationships yang macam boyfriend girlfriend
no matter what as long kau belum married kan you are considered just dating
I rather you still dating terus aku fikir balik
it somehow makes sense but maybe culture pun plays a part ah
asal ah
kau nampak ah
kau pun tak ada status pe
takde eh
yang laki selalu kau post eh
untuk aku ni semua macam pun ikut surroundings ah
cam not everytime kau kena guard
musim-musim you know you have to time yourself
kalau it's time to emotion let it out lah but if it's not the time then it's okay for you to be this way we understand
but at the time kau kau tak cakap then you still takde as long ah you know
cause of them takut cakap
laki takut nak keluarkan emotion kan but
some of them dorang okay keluar emotion but they don't know when
bila orang tak tahu macam mana nak express dorang punya emotions aku tak boleh pegang ah
ha ha ha asal asal dia cakap gitu
missus cheong sedih ah tak nak tengok
to think of it kan it's as seram at the same time
once dia dah realise ah
tapi untuk aku singapore is just that kita tak jumpa orang yang extreme ah like feminist
kau sendiri macam it's a wreck
dia is the true
epitome yang yang YouTube
video yang kau cakap most of this
just macam rosak ah like
that's why kau cakap they use this macam as their own is their moral compass ah
like tak tahu apa yang salah betul dorang pakai ni then they just follow from there
that time cousin aku kena
dia post about ada accident dekat sengkang kan
he happened to help orang yang apa this anak dengan bapa dia ah accident motor abeh dia cakap pasal err dorang accident motor pasal dorang apa ada a wild dog
terus end up this
perempuan datang like into the conversation and say that eh like cakap like
there's this humans is the problem for entering dorang punya wild life and dorang cakap if this is what if you're talking about like putting them putting them down
terus cousin aku macam flip ah cakap you don't put words inside my mouth
macam don't stir something up that it is not there
what the fuck sia attention rabak sia
I mean like dia nya cousin aku nya intention is just to show that okay this area is quite dangerous imagine kalau kau lalu kan just beware of the dogs ah the macam apa wild animals
ni semua orang just find it a like opening of for them to just preach
tak tahu ah malaysia ah
yang malaysian
yang belikan anak dia semua eh
anak dia yang gemuk tu kan
what if the this whole thing is turn table laki yang buat gitu then laki cakap kak sedar lah diri muka kau tu dah buruk gini gini then you know it's just turn out to be ugly
ya we are untuk aku kan at the end of the day we are just living in two separate rules
dia tak macam sense of emergency ah
cannot focus macam takleh
ah dia kacau ah
dorang just macam
camne nak cakap eh pasal the reason why tiga orang to operate that one man machine kan is cause that two person tak tahu apa
ah macam terus ni apesal
rabak sia tu
like kepala ah orang
umur berapa sia
kalau aku aku tak kesah sia like I think taufik pernah cakap ah the macam untuk aku the apa not it's too accessible apa knowledge eh
dorang pakai sembarang jer
oh macam dia annoyed
kau kau pause eh
tak kan
takpe ah aku bawa gi toilet jer boleh berbual-bual sikit
ah tak ah sangkut kat luar
a'ah cuci tangan
semalam shuk shuk bawa apa ah makan
wah best pe macam yang taiwan taiwan nya eh
wah aku dah macam
huh bastard asal
oh tak halal
huh kau makan
oh kau taruk tepi untuk simpan
sial ah kau
asal ah
dia apa fight as if like politically or
untuk aku is a marketing strategy ah
kalau dia macam berbual macam admit dia president siapa nak vote dia seh
macam dia have to say
tapi kau tahu yang dia popular face habis cakap grab them by the pussy kan
ah itu bukan dia cakap during press ke atau during ni kan it's during macam dia punya free time want to record dengar kan
pasal tak salah aku aku tengok video clip is like somewhere macam kau tahu yang camera macam sembunyi-sembunyi abeh dia ada wall abeh ada
macam mesti lah orang orang kat luar laki lain pun cakap macam gitu apa it's just that ni pasal dia korang macam nak use that against pasal ramai orang kalau kau tengok they use that phrase against dia apa this is how he treats women gini macam sial ah
pasal orangnya perception eh perspective sekarang is like
camne eh they rather have someone yang in the closet
macam sial rather than orang outspoken
dorang takleh accept orang outspoken macam orang he only talking his own opinion in what appears on his mind what tapi orang tak boleh accept
pasal kalau untuk aku orang tu clean kan terlalu baik aku aku always despise
macam there's there's always a way macam macam mana kita berbual pun kan ]even though
you want the best for each other kan but definitely kita macam gini boys talk atau mesti ada berbual kotor pe like gini gini but
orang yang macam terlalu clean kan aku always very despise macam
bukan aku jealous tau like how are you really sure kau macam gini punya bersih like
cam they feel their feelings express it that's all
lagi twenty seven minutes
all the lie tak ah
asal eh
tak tahu apa dia nak ah
so at the end of the day pun different orang tengok lain pe
so macam upon macam texts pun sama
macam kalau aku cakap sial lah kau
tapi kalau kau baca eh dia ni maki aku pe sial
tapi kalau aku aku cakap in a very playful way
kalau kau tengok macam kau punya thoughts macam gitu then kau fikir cara gitu then
how can can you blame me sia aku say in a very cannot blame me ah
non-stop sia tu
ah dorang ada record macam some dorangnya
talk ah sedih sia
pasal kau boleh dengar dari suara dia sia kau yang ah
aku tak tumbuk kau sia I mean like kau tumbuk aku
kau tak cakap abeh amber macam aku pukul kau jer pe
pots and pans kau campak vase
like tak salah ke tu salah seh kau tahu
macam aku ada listen to few tips orang kahwin ah orang dah kahwin cakap
then that's why it makes sense bila dia cakap
kan selalu cakap stephen kan
buat apa kau nak relationship lama-lama
in the end asal kau nak a meet up marriage before you get married you know you are creating another problem for yourself
kadang-kadang fikir balik macam sedih sia kalau yet to find out
macam apa ni the person that kau sukakan and then bila korang kahwin is just a different person
abeh korang stuck tau you are stuck there don't know like kalau aku tinggal
ni thing aku salah bila aku let it be it's gonna be a problem for me so how do I even solve this sia
like I really dia just stuck sia
that's why aku always believe this phrase macam doesn't mean we can vibe we are compatible
like tak semestinya kita boleh vibe macam eh but we are compatible for each other it doesn't mean that vibe and compatibility is two different thing
like aku boleh kita like boleh macam
ah people always said like wah if I can vibe with you okay okay but sial lah that is just a touch atau it's a two different things seh
whether you're not kau boleh tinggal serumah dengan dia and like accept who she is that's a different thing sia
so untuk aku macam orang selalu macam cakap aku boleh vibe dengan kau it's a
it's not macam it's not cause you can't true
dia nya expectations or
that's why aku takut aku tak understand about aku nya self especially
like sometimes aku suka orang ni then aku akan go for her
but kan bila dah at the stage macam boleh aku just cabut diri
untuk aku is like tak one thing is commitment ah macam the commitment of having someone to jaga is untuk aku really takut untuk aku
ya aku nya reason why aku aku understand this part of me eh aku cakap reason why aku takde mata air bukan aku cakap aku takleh dapat aku boleh but it's just that
dah a few times aku try and then aku just cabut
like aku just fuck up like I always find the reason to fuck this up ah like
just ghost her atau
ya so like sometimes aku just macam bingit ah macam takde then you know like I want something but bila dah ada nanti aku just cabut
so I always remind myself macam
kalau aku suka orang aku cakap kalau dia betul-betul then go for it ah if not then for what you waste your time
like in the end of the day kau akan cabut juga pe at the end of the day kalau kau tak suka dia
that's why that time kawan kau tanya aku aku terus teringat sia ni
kawan kau yang yang kerja nurse eh part-time
tak ah dia tanya takde mata air macam tak ah macam asal entah eh terus aku terus cam teringat ah ni like
aku kalau ada ada ah tapi it's just that at the end of the day aku cabut
aku ya
ya pasal
untuk aku pun itu is a different way of err camne nak cakap eh
it's a different way of macam kita own body ada own mechanics ah
the reason why macam aku dengan kau is always macam
diam dulu then nanti baru gerek is cause technically we are trying to protect ourselves
like dia ni boleh ngam ke tak tak leh ngam then why not why for what aku waste akunya time
kalau dia punya dia punya mindset is macam I got nothing to lose the world is mine
then like just live life to the fullest lah that kind of mindset ah but for us yes we have that mindset but it's just that macam
macam apa ni you don't need it unless we really need it come ya
romanticism atau all the stuff
ya lah I understand
one thing dorang been berbual pasal gender role ni semua kan dorang sendiri confused with their own gender role this kind of thing untuk aku lelaki shouldn't be the one doing it the most of the time it's it's a feminist trait lah I would say
so macam all these macam sweet stuff
all the macam masculine stuff the girl of course have to be kalau dua-dua side macam family then how how do we even counter this
there's no balance ah then after that's when nanti dorang dah complain oh dia ni annoying ah gini gini gini
like you eat too much sweets sakit tekak pe
kalau kau suka laki tu apa-apa dia buat pun sweet pe
dia tak buat apa-apa pun sweet abeh kalau laki tu macam he's not your type
asal pula aku kena panggil creep
ya lah
that's untuk aku there's no such thing ah
cause the scariest part kan macam macam mana kau dah kahwin dengan this someone kan
how sure are you that this twenty four hour otak dia is bedek bedek
bila kita tengah main kan aku boleh imagine someone else asal kau tak boleh imagine someone else confirm kau boleh imagine someone else pe but at the end of the day you have to give and take let her be and let her think let us think
that that's why the misconcept of macam
like oh takde connect then they cakap to make it in a very layman dengan very
to see that they are smart atau they can feel all these oh takde connection ah
ah lagi
thirty seconds nak tidur nak tidur
like anything this world pape ah dalam dunia ni
duit ah standard ah duit standard ah like I think semua orang pun semua orang pun nak duit pe
cakap duit jer
kau dah beli semua benda ah shiq
uh keluarga ah keluarga keluarga aku
but untuk aku kalau lagi pandai ah minta like the third wish tu
aku cakap err five five hundred more wishes
pandai sia
apa yang genie
sama ah
takde kau percaya ah benda gini ada betul dia hidup
asal kasut asal kau choose kasut
dah cukup pe sama pe boleh beli semua kasut pe
yang sihat ah untuk kau
tak cakap rabak ah but
banyak banyak juga ah macam what I have to go through
apa ni hidup aku dengan keluarga aku it's it's been a it's been a ride ah like just life hidup in general ah life in general
love is important ah for me like obviously love love memang
kau tak nak for
semua benda kau benci like it's all it's all based on hate
okay kau imagine
kau imagine kau hidup abeh macam abeh kau uh semua benda kau benci until like kau uh
kau cam kesah kan diri sendiri jer
untuk kau tak untuk kau apa ni worth it ke hidup
hidup kan like about hidup dalam dunia ni
I'll call it a dunia yang kejam ni ah like actually like the world is tough ah
world is tough um untuk aku okay kau pun imagine
like takde link ah maybe takde
um apa ni
perbezaan dia ah lain ah as in soalan aku tapi cam tanya jer ah macam kalau kau bayang kan macam kau hidup
ah like everyday apa kau nak jer kau dapat
kau rasa pun worth it tak hidup
asal worth it
tapi kau dapat semua benda kau bayang kan eh kalau
ah tuhan dia tak buka dunia ni
like ibarat abeh buat apa kita percaya dalam syurga neraka kalau kau hari-hari
kalau kau hari-hari semua benda yang kau nak kau dapat kau tak yah work for it
kau tak yah stress about it
kau just cam apa kau nak kau dapat ah so like
it's always been that way sampai kau mati ah tak kan tak kan kau nak hidup
tak kan kau nak hidup gitu like
you like what's apa orang cakap what's the point of ah living
bukan like
ah kalau
kalau kau hidup aku nak obviously like
every everything I mean like if a life has a purpose what and kalau if semua benda yang kau nak then what's the point of living right like uh might but basically you were just saying like
we living in heaven ah dalam syurga sia kira kita rasa syurga ah terus dah tak payah hidup pape like kau pun percaya tuhan pe kan
it's been hard lah it's hard it's been hard to tolerate life ah as it is ah obviously ah I mean like uh saying it for everyone ya tapi rabak opinion kau kau cakap
semua benda kau nak dapat takmo rabak ah
tapi untuk kau kalau macam about like relationship with a girl
apa kau nak like
apa kau nak uh
what apa kau cari dalam
perempuan idaman kau ah
ya so apa apa perempuan idaman kau like
untuk aku I think like
that's uh in general tu apa semua laki pun nak lah
but like uh kau try think think harder think deeper like feel like deeper like apa kau nak apa kau sebenarnya nak
uh dalam wanita like because let's be honest ah like
in life you weren't like kau tak kan kau tak kan dapat perempuan yang sempurna like tak ada orang sempurna pe dalam hidup ni
so kau tak kan dapat orang yang sempurna so like just think deep like kau rasa apa yang those some qualities that
think deeper ah just like what's like let's say lah macam
cam aku okay let berbual pasal aku eh
untuk aku kalau aku perempuan yang aku nak is
someone yang err tak pandang aku macam
dia tengok aku macam lebih daripada lebih daripada orang lain ah macam uh aku nak rasa like I'm like I'm just someone who whose the only one in the world ah like you know
you know kau faham apa aku cakap like
lawa ni semua siapa tak nak siapa tak nak lawanya orang siapa pun tak nak orang yang handsome semua orang pun nak but ya or ah and one more thing yang can
it you know it keeps me alive ah it keeps me laughing I like to laugh you know ah apa ni ketawa semua orang suka ketawa pe
ya so untuk aku perempuan kalau boleh buat aku ketawa that's already
err you know kalau uh in english dia called it like what red flag for one side of the team if
if you get what I mean ah kalau faham ah kau faham tak
so macam
ya like kalau
kalau boleh buat ketawa it's already something ah it's like a lot ah for me
because to me lah perempuan tak perempuan perempuan tak kelakar sangat [ah] like like maybe
yang aku jumpa dorang tak kelakar dorang macam lame ah but I mean I find it cute as well but
maybe one or two girls yang I find uh very entertaining and kelakar ah
dia tak payah like faham aku dia tak payah aku ah sepenuhnya but aku just expect aku just expect dia to be there for me get me
uh so like okay so let me ask you ah sekali lagi sekali aku tanya kau
okay lah kalau kau ah berbual pasal macam experience
macam like

minta break
korang apa dah mata air officially ke tak
okay ah continue aku punya eh
ah aku punya is um
when she said that aku just didn't know how to take it because tu first time aku pe as I said ah macam tu first time aku pe first in everything tau
aku just
aku just tried to apa ni
aku tak layan sesiapa kau tahu macam dorang ajak lepak semua aku nangis and then like obvious ah like nangis semua biasa
ah aku cam emotional emotional gila and then like
orang ajak aku lepak semua then dorang macam tak
or I didn't apa ni
uh didn't go ah macam I
I wasn't feeling it ah so cam aku just stay at home for you could say for someone uh like me
it was a long period of time where aku just stay rumah
and then aku cam
you know like aku stay rumah for like I think
two weeks ah aku rasa dua minggu ah aku stay rumah case bila orang ajak lepak
case bila orang ajak lepak aku cam tak aku tak nak aku tak kasi dorang reason betul lah aku just diam kan diri aku just
buat hal sendiri ah hal sendiri tak kacau orang
and then ya aku just nangis and I just couldn't accept it ah and ah dah gitu takpe aku when uh even though she said she don't want know anything already and like cry and I'm like I was
aku cam aku cam in denial
I don't know ah for someone else to judge for you to judge or what ah like aku cakap dengan dia cam like
ah asal tiba gini cam takleh berbual ke like
tak kan tiba-tiba nak cakap
ah heartless like tak kan dia tak boleh ingat apa like uh apa kita dah lalui ah like everything
and cam
aku dah cuba ah semua benda sia aku cuba in that in the first one but
slowly I realised cam aku tak boleh buat pape ah and at one point ah I think I was just pestering her too much that I wasn't even pestering ah because actually tu
err hari jadi dia
and then dah gitu aku wish ah
bila aku wish terus ah dia cakap her reply was very
and then uh aku diam ah then aku cam dah gitu takpe then macam then dah gitu aku realised aku check ah then aku check WhatsApp and then just realised dia block aku
on WhatsApp dia block aku on Instagram
err every platform yang kita boleh berbual dia block ah basically
and then aku cam but
the last straw and then so aku cam
aku ambil jer ah aku just angkat jer ah apa yang telan jer ah aku just telan apa yang
dia dah tu kira
the last straw so aku tengok that was the
so I just thought like okay ah I guess aku kena I have to let go ah and
it's over the healing process lama sia
like gentle sia healing process lama sia tu first nya but
you know most of the time it's not going to be ah most of the time kau boleh cakap ah kebanyakkan tak ada orang akan last sampai
kahwin ke jannah from the first one tau
so itu apa aku cakap
siapa tak nak kan semua orang nak lah banyak benda sia semua orang nak like cuma
as I said ah macam tadi like
kalau benda semua semua benda kau dapat dalam dunia pun buat apa hidup pe
tak kan apa beza dia kalau kau tanya yang tiga wishes
cam satu benda jer
apa link sia
pape free uh makanan ah
tapi aku tak nak siapa tak nak free makan aku suka makan siapa pun suka makan
kalau boleh hari-hari Pizza Hut pun Pizza Hut sia hari-hari
muak ah tapi cam
okay but ya anyways walaupun kau berbual tak ada link
takpe aku continue story aku pasal aku nak berbual aku nya story
aku feel bad I feel bad for feeling this way
pasal aku dah dengan
aku feel bad a little bad
aku rasa cam it's a crime
pasal for feeling this because
I already have a girl right now okay kau faham kan
aku cam this girl was like
the ah let's say aku rasa cam second minggu of my school week
so basically this girl was the second my second date ah so cam I saw her
uh at this eating place kat sekolah
kat sekolah ah uh terus dah gitu uh
ini pun tapi ya aku dah nampak dia actually funny story is uh
apa yang kelakar is macam
actually aku
kawan aku lagi dua kau kenal juga ah ah actually tak penting ah cam siapa but like aku lagi dua kita dah macam
uh kita dah macam tiga-tiga dah nampak like ni perempuan
and then kita semua cam nak ah tiga-tiga nak cam don't mind try ah kita just main-main time tu time tu kita main-main tak kesah pasal pape ah
because ah aku pun macam rasa aku heartless afterwards
a bit lah maybe exaggeration but I don't think maybe a bit lah and then so aku cam main-main ah tak kesah siapa nak next siapa nak
try try jer ah main-main ah pape jadi jadi ah
and then so cam
kita tiga ah dah gitu kita tiga buat bet siapa kalah pergi minta Instagram
perempuan ni ah and then ah one of them lost ah so cam dia kena pergi minta
err dah gitu kita dah minta
tiga-tiga ah err in the end tiga-tiga dapat pe Instagram dah gitu err
dorang tak jadi ah dorang tak jadi try
ke apa dorang just
dorang pun ada sendiri sendiri nya somehow dorang pun
so aku cam ya I found this girl
to be oh first aku cam
for a few days aku tahan aku tengok story orang dia semua macam mana
aku tak plan pun actually nak
ah through dia nya social media jer ah as in aku tak tahu ah camne because aku belum berbual
so cam aku tengok jer ah dia nya social media dia macam mana
dia okay
so aku cam oh dia okay jer actually
because like aku found dia punya stories to be entertaining
kau tahu cam Instagram stories dia
uh cam entertaining
abeh cam kelakar kelakar it's really kelakar even for me you know
dah gitu uh
you know uh I was aku tried to aku go ahead ah and then uh aku tried to her ah and then
oh but I thought I was a little heartless maybe exaggerate ah cam
aku dia and then err
to to say ah love at first sight cam
pun exaggeration ah cam lebih ah tapi cam I like her a lot ah
at one point kan I could say bukan cakap not bad ah aku boleh cakap sempurna sia
dia cam dia cam uh ya ni ni ah ni ah this is the one ah this one I thought like oh
so kita continue so we talk we talk we talk berbual berbual berbual
sometimes we misunderstood each other it's okay because uh benda ni semua normal pe
ah so dah gitu takpe ah then
on that day tak salah aku sejuk
nak mampus ah aku cakap dengan kau sejuk nak mampus tak tahu asal it wasn't dia nak hujan dia sebelum hujan and then
aku pun demam so menambah ah sejuk
bertambah sejuk aku cam apa ni time tu tiba-tiba kita berbual ah on that day it was normal tau semua benda normal
kita berbual cam biasa uh
and then tiba-tiba dia cakap err dia ada benda nak bilang aku
then aku cam huh apa dia aku cam tak fikir buruk ah pasal apa yang nak jadi
so terus dia cakap
yang dia dah tak terus aku tanya ah
what's wrong apa jadi apa asal abeh apa yang dia nak bilang aku ah and then aku cakap ah like
ah terus dia bilang ah ah she said that
sama ah sama macam yang first nya macam just tiba
abeh aku macam uh ah what do you mean ah
and then ah dia cakap ah macam
somehow dia nya feelings dah lost ah
abeh macam dia dah lose feelings ah terus
aku cam huh asal seh boleh tiba gitu I thought everything was going good
imperfect ways I saw perfectness ah to me lah I aku nak honest ah like ni I know it's like very
the last relationship I pestered her and then like maybe it's kind of like macam guilt trip sikit ah but
ini I just learnt like okay lah I cannot do anything about it what
itu apa yang penting ah untuk aku like ah apa ni kebahagiaan dia
so kalau dia bahagia aku okay ah
aku cam cakap dengan dia then aku just cakap dengan dia okay ah if that's what you want then I love you enough ah untuk aku I love you I love her enough to let her go ah untuk lepas kan dia
so then aku cam
okay ah apa ni
the day uh apa eh
so aku just cakap ah I just give her a long note I said err all the best in life ah kalau dia perlu kan pape I will still be here you know I'll still be a friend if you want to consider me that you know ah whatever it is know I've always care for you
aku just cam
so aku just accepted how it was and how it is
and aku just wanted her to be happy
talk time and time ah again we don't talk everyday so untuk kau okay tak to be aku tanya kau dulu untuk kau okay tak kalau
kau kawan dengan ex kau
untuk kau okay kalau kau kawan dengan ex kau
okay aku faham ah but
okay so kita jadi kawan ah
and then like time and time I ask about her because I still care about her you know I always care you know to me untuk aku in my own
yang ni apa aku nak cakap ah so like
aku cam okay ah takpe as in I I mean lah I was already accepting it ah as it is I just want her to be happy ah kan ada
happy dah cukup
ah apa ni
uh it's just that sometimes we do see each other you know in school because it's the same school what so cam
oh terus aku I I found this girl ah this other girl at

dah pusing terjatuh then there was like five chairs peoples of full people like like there was like I think many people inside that place there was like I think thirty people already over there
they saw me falling but the best thing was that my hair was all face oh to my my hair was all to my face right so dia orang tak boleh nampak pun my face
oh cause bilik spare
pasal okay
recently dia buat dia
he did this one thing ah dia
okay and then afterwards yup ya tu the the other time different something that was something shadier ah
what he did was he like borrowed money from kawan aku cakap kawan aku lah ah this one guy
I mean I think you can guess lah who what what this entity is lah rather than who abeh
abeh lepastu then
kawan aku texted me
ah my our mutual friend dia cakap
eh apasal ada orang text aku
ni cakap owe money pay money rumah tenet nya
abeh like with pictures of his house and everything
in a bit I thought he was kidding ah cause aku saw the pictures eh ni legit sia
so I call him ah called my aku called tenet aku cakap dengan tenet eh
kau tahu apa-apa tak pasal ni please reply ah
abeh dia cakap oh tak tak ni semua tak tahu ni dah lama dah dah<malay>lama aku hutang abeh aku tak kasi nombor wafan which is our friend ah
aku tak kasi nombor wafan abeh I don't know how they got wafan number
abeh aku macam okay ah initially aku percaya dia ah then afterwards aku talk to my friend on the phone ah yang kena
eh afan kau ingat tak that time there's this one time ada orang tiba-tiba call kau cakap they are from
ah clarifying you abeh cakap ah do you know tenet
kata ya ya it's not my brother but that one my friend
macam okay ah
abeh lepastu ah ah then after we came to the conclusion that tu yang
that entity he borrowed the money from ah standard lah nak verify
you just anyhow give random person's number ke tak kan ya
so that afterwards aku macam oh
that's the thing we didn't know he didn't even know my friend ni that he didn't know that dia would be part of this ah macam
collateral damage I keep saying collateral damage pe semalam
abeh macam we were just
abeh terus when I call him about it aku cakap kau tell me honestly ah kau cakap kau tak kasi number then afterwards I ask him
yang that time this one
shady number called my friend tu betul tak
what you claim it was ke ini
abeh dia cakap ah actually betul lah gitu then asal kau tipu
kau tell us lah when you already in this shit
kau tell us properly ah abeh macam terus sorry sorry kata dah clear
aku dah macam dah haiya
oh tu aku tak aku tak sure ah but he can go there ah
so ya aku abeh lepastu then yesterday eh this morning ke yesterday he said
I'm going to move out and by the end of the month aku dah macam
cause any harm to me or my family yet apa so I don't think it's fair
so aku cakap it's okay for you still want to stay here tapi like end of the month ke apa ah
ya by october that was the initial agreement abeh lepastu dia cakap eh yang dia nak extend until first december aku okay
then afterwards she said dia nak tukar until
eh no ya five ke march I can't remember
ya aku okay ah cause he's been a good
so far tapi then
one thing on top of another lah that happen to him abeh then aku keep telling him don't do this don't do this you want to do them not here
abeh well
what macam very
and no you don't someone who doesn't think of consequences on top like very short-term nya thinking
you know you know those kind of people apa
snowball anjing
dia belum move lagi dia cakap dia nak
abeh aku cakap dengan dia takyah lah
end of next month dah okay
abeh like he thinks that
I don't know he thinks macam ye lah paiseh ah
if he knew about shade kau asal buat ni semua kan
ya he should have been tapi
that's the thing lah that's as good as me using your name abeh aku tak bilang kau macam eh ah nak pinjam duit
you know aku secretly put you as the macam kau applicant ah without without your consent
tu shitty thing to do kan
abeh kawan aku tu gi geylang dengan dia cakap macam
not really doesn't have a place macam I dare not kind of thing macam kau lah basically
aku didn't really bitch at him about it lah aku tak macam bising ke apa lah aku tak
like I wasn't really angry at him I I told I told him upfront aku I I said
I'm not angry at you aku more concerned rather than angry lah cause I was not in the receiving end of this ah so it's fine lah
cause that time pun the previous issue pun he didn't tell me then I found out aku pun pissed ah I told you already not to do that anymore
macam it's addictive what
yes of course it got stolen abeh lepastu he was really bummed out about it
am thinking lah what to do now abeh ada other ah ada issues as well
no he borrowed me money abeh lepastu aku trying to recoup back the amount that he took
bab tu lah he's going to pay back I hope lah eventually
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us ke
from what aku understand ah my wife said the same thing you get me
farid cakap he would just salam me and just cam balik
I mean okay lah it's true ah macam you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
ah aku aku do feel that every time aku hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress ah now they divorced kan
aku every time
aku do feel
what I shouldn't be there okay lah kim said it perfectly ah cakap
I don't want to validate this relationship tapi I don't want to say macam eh you cannot hang out with us ah
macam I want to hang out with him
but then eventually what I did was aku just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
lupa ah good names
twenty twelve I think ah aku don't really remember exactly
tapi eh eh anal lah then okay anyways stress ah aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas think
cakap please boleh astagfirullahaladzim
tapi kalau just the
okay let's say it was just aku fahim and
lupa ah good names okay whatever lah bukannya ah okay anyway aku fahim and mistress lepak just the three of us the whole time
tapi this one whole group
tak usually we will know though
I mean initially my wife was worried lah dia cakap
what if you get tempted to you know macam add in to the dark side aku dah macam
to be fair kan aku only met his now ex wife lah very very few times I think
abeh kalau dia punya bad points aku rasa
she is too deep in this mentality where aku tak tahu it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before cakap macam
you know they don't have eh eh concrete plan to do whatever lah cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial ke emotionally or both usually both lah
ya ya okay it is controversial tapi
but aku I I don't know why I I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating ah this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family punya background dia macam financial background ah more than anything lah of course lah that plays a huge part
tapi okay ah to be fair
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not lah I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her aku rasa dia punya other other point
she aku tak tahu eh fahim ah probably it is ah maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is macam he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not macam many many many times
ya ya aku agree lah I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
aku macam how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
tak tahu ah
no some apa no no surprise lah where you came from like which country you came from
aku rasa that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
aku believe kan the country could do much better if the royal family
invest in infrastructure in country lagi sikit cakap company
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come abeh lepastu boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on ah
but they don't so aku found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
other things ah macam wan ah
so aku macam find that to be very thought superficial is one thing lah the other one is
lama sia
kau okay you you talk to the guy before kan
aku tak tahu lah abeh oh anyway dia cerita cerita abeh then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
aku dah macam please lah get on to your next point lah
ah aku tak tahu eh
tak tahu ah
ah aku find that
takpe why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial lah eh he said this one line ah aku macam palm his face ah he said you know initially I thought
aku dah macam eh kau don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me lah sia
aku dah macam eh kau please please please don't give me a
macam there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see lah for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue ke tak if it's what you really want then go for it of course lah no one listens to my advice pe aku kan just an apa
which which she should have done from the start ah aku tak tahu kenapa she still engaged to follow him around
aku just find that very creepy
takde anything anymore together asal kau do this also I don't know
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying oh my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much macam you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her lah
macam aku don't agree with the mentality ah ada orang cakap oh tak lah ni semua kerja perempuan macam eh
ah ni ni untuk kau
tak you know some people would step up ah dorang macam believe that they are better at it
yes I do only aku only one t-shirt aku don't iron
it's good to have one kau at least buy a steamer ah
masai sia tak iron
um so aku
you know lose not losing weight apa
he said he was at her play ah their place ah her place there there so long if he was their place he and din this mat salleh melayu aku very confused
his balding tak penting ah but
both of them went over to fahim place abeh ah ruqayyah was asleep
macam aku gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain lah cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared sia to the point where aku realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it lah I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing macam
ya lah I I know lah but macam you can tell what there's a huge difference when you look at the photo macam from six days ago ke ten years ago
then macam
I really gain like twenty kilo sia macam you can tell lah pe the difference
I think for me aku at most gain about
ten around ten aku actually gain more initially then I aku started losing weight
aku controlling my food intake these days
aku don't really care what I eat more of
ya macam let's say aku the the trick is to have your breakfast as late
then the second meal let's say if you eat macam merepek minang ah aku just had minang again yesterday best decision ever
lepastu end up kau confirm lapar pe
ah minang then at night aku makan cereal
aku started at sixty six
tak not there's some most nya chart would say aku average ah
oh local nya eh
yup you have a point ah pasal the whole ya shouldn't have
I should look into the maybe atau kalau malaysia nya pun boleh pakai lah
aku tengok benda-benda bodoh macam dia cakap nanti ah
aku tak tahu ah
kau lain ah
ya takleh cakap sekarang
then they took a took a picture lepastu aku perasan macam
eh aku dah gemuk gila ke apa
then I macam
ya I show you before ya which which is good lah then I was not expecting that turn ah which really changed everything ah aku stop drinking sweet things exclusively I used to drink flavoured drinks exclusively and I stop
there's a while aku really crave teh then aku macam okay lah we go buy teh then I think so okay ah
not so lah couldn't not really heavily addicted to food kau tahu macam people some eat a lot of gluttony gonna shit I don't lah
german nya the vacuum guy
I think so but I forgot or you never did I am not sure apa dia apa dia buat
sardin pe
like some people tak change their passport semua they just
change for the heck of it macam kau tahu you get the conversion card kan
macam grudgingly ah
oh as in the whole ah like handling the zakat
oh ya ya ya tu aku agree ah I have to agree with that correct
so ni semua subjective pe
siapa they both
your dad ke your mum
who she she tak
is it one of those macam trial lessons
no some people think of it that way macam are you sure you want to stoop this low and want to marry asian some people which fucked up lah but then some people really think of it that way I can do it
ah so aku tak tahu ah macam maybe just tell her that
tapi if I know switzerland is doing ke australia forgot like german speaking country it's not
ah apa nama tu
it's like a feature wall belakang katil
satu nak macam like that
then depan dia you want to put your projector or what then it's up to you lah
nak frame apa
might as well paint sendiri kan terus tampal amacam
I don't want to put something like you know macam frame
kena kat kepala tengah tidur sakit sial
confirm sakit
confirm sakit
I thought you want to tear down the wall and then taruk dining room
eh dining room pula dining table
entrance tu kan nak buat ah ni
nak buat banyak raised floor
it does so that macam if let's say orang datang
orang duduk kat atas raised floor tu kan macam lepak ke baring-baring ke
a'ah eh orang daripada luar boleh nampak eh
mmhmm nanti jadi
kaum puak eh
nak buat raised floor tak dekat sebelah tingkap
on anzari had ada ah
okay how about that room the first bedroom tu
kita buat yes kita buat raised floor
and then kita
buat bilik tu macam our workstation
ya it's like macam
it's it's a macam mana nak cakap eh
okay dia
raised floor dia sampai dekat tingkap tu so that kita boleh baca kat atas tu kita boleh duduk kat atas tu kita boleh lepak
where you can even baring lah senang cakap boleh boleh tidur lah kat situ
and then dia tak tinggi sangat dia tak rendah sangat
correct so if you can either duduk or you can even baring
but it's near the tingkap lah then bawah tu can put books or maybe kita boleh taruk maybe some
apa drawer or something like that
okay remember bilik tu ada ada almari
yang almari yang built-in
pecah kan
we we make a table macam yang
ah or either way lah mana mana nya side lah so that is where our
ah apa nama dia
laptop and our workstation ah senang cakap
then at the side maybe we just pasang satu
ah satu apa nama dia
satu swing yang mount dekat daripada ceiling
we don't mount dekat ceiling lah then we buy the the one that with stand
we get the swing yang you know yang facing each other punya
you know the one yang kita lepak dekat
nanti swing tu goyang sendiri
tutup lah pintu jangan masuk masa I tak ada
no lah I mean the swing yang satu tapi the stand okay pe
if we are going to workout kat rumah
okay then maybe okay then maybe satu
ah for us to run ke apa ke
if I want to go for weights then I go to the gym yang dekat tu
alah then tak ada swing
tak lah swing tu tak bergerak sendiri lah
atau swing taruk dekat living room ah living room lagi nampak
the yang
mount nak kena pay extra eh
mount cuba kalau because if we mount kita tak boleh alih-alih kan
why do I want to alih-alih kan
if let's say ya macam like macam kat rumah awak
kan macam mak
from this side then dia nak change to the other side
ah lepastu ni sekarang dia nak change to this side balik
ah macam dia boleh change tapi kalau dah mount
dah tak boleh tukar dah tak boleh ubah
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down mana nak taruk tu
boleh memang betul but then
dekat wall the other side is not
wooden wall faham tak
dia boleh alih even with the console dia boleh alih
okay kalau kita ada console
we can move it to the window macam my house
ya okay pasal my house dia tak mount kan then on on top the console pe
ah so dia boleh alih-alih
so from there dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat wall atau dia boleh dekat this wall
so you can you can actually macam if let's say this year you nak macam gini then next year you nak macam gini
ah tukar mood you know tukar tukar tempat ke
it it might you know we don't know which which one yang
kena dengan kita pe
no lights can just tampal belakang jer
so the light shine dekat tembok
so it it if kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang lah dia tak shine
dia boleh shine boleh boleh shine tapi tak nampak sangat ah
but if you put on the wall kalau ah facing the wall
then the the light will show apa
will memacarkan
dekat wall
of course lah tak lah
tu dah colour colour
no okay macam let's say sini
putih eh
then sini macam grey
and then sini putih sini grey
so that it will look macam apa tau how to say eh
because your okay because you said you don't want the colour to lari jauh pe it's medium grey and light grey
so okay if you even if you put it together macam gini dua dua and then in the middle you taruk
you campur dua dua
and then you go and paste ah macam
mm mm ya ya tapi satu tub one whole big tub tu tak cukup satu rumah
kalau one whole house is about two
yang besar yang as in tub besar gitu tau
ah yang the one yang sikit hari ayah bawa balik ah yes correct that one two
kalau for the whole house
it depends on the colour juga
so yang chalk nya is like macam
susah nak hilang ah
oh macam macam you know the pagar yang colour hijau tu
pakai chalk sudah normal one
dia jatuh takut belakang tali dia pasang tali tali putus jatuh kat kepala kita sakit kan
might as well just tampal
tampal tak okay tampal dia boleh cabut
so in a dia tak stay permanently
I thought living room you don't want to put ayat-ayat
eh kentalnya tak nak ah
frame is so old school seh tak nak ah don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want
but if you put frame dah macam rumah pakcik makcik
tu jer I can say it looks modern but if you put it in a frame it looks old school
faham tak then that is a different story
okay then kat bilik ah
see kat bilik pun tak nak
so nak kena ada pergi balik
okay is it ayat as in ayat from the al-quran or ayat is just macam words of wisdom
since awak tak nak nampak sangat eyesore sangat kan why not put it in the dining room
where got tembok
masuk rumah is just tembok kecil sikit jer
ah tembok kecil sikt lepastu dah pagar pagar pagar pe
tembok tu I think I want to macam panjang kan sikit ah
then the yang yang satu satu satu tu nak buang
but then kita tak ada if like that then kita tak ada store
I know so I thought if let's say kita dah masuk then we make that store we make it as a store
and then our dining room kita kecil kan sikit ah sebab meja besar gila ah meja dia boleh duduk berapa enam tujuh lapan sepuluh orang boleh duduk
I don't know whether we still need store room tak because barang-barang besar kotak-kotak apa ke nak simpan
kita beli vacuum like vacuum punya kotak you know that kind of thing
then kotak-kotak tu nak simpan
okay so we kita akan kecil kan that dining room
so that masuk boleh jalan kat dalam
atau sini taruk barang aje then sini boleh jalan
nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu ah I mean I think by next year I think next year kita dah boleh buat ah
bomb shelter is semua rumah baru
kita nya bomb shelter is kat bawah blok
bomb shelter kat bawah
yang tempat budak-budak ah sekolah tu nursery ah that one is bomb shelter
ada uh I think kat bawah
mm tapi dia buat macam
I don't know lah but I don't think ada orang occupy that room
ah flat yang ada bomb shelter
ya because my flat ni ada bomb shelter untuk orang-orang yang macam macam daripada blok sebelah
blok sebelah ah nak lari
second room is macam taruk
maybe kita cantik kan sikit ke atau do some cleaning on it
so we just I think just guest room atau tempat orang nak solat ah dah
if let's say orang nak solat ah
even kalau dekat dalam study room tu orang nak solat pun boleh
kecil ah
but okay lah should be okay lah macam bilik amni
mm bilik amni is like that
ya kita nak taruk dia kat situ is katil yang
for now maybe my single bed ah single bed taruk sana dulu
because kalau
satu orang jer boleh tidur
tak kan satu nak tidur bawah satu tidur atas kan
takpe lah just
apa nama dia mm
katil queen-sized
just masukkan satu katil queen-sized
tapi nak kena swee swee kira menghadap
gitu lah so ada space a lot more space
so can solat down there
eh awak punya handphone macam jauh jer
tak tahu dengar ke tak lah but
because down there dorang dah buat
uh apa nama dia
dah buat almari kat situ
okay the the almari is L shaped
ah camne nak cakap eh it's like macam okay ni tiga room
letak sini dua then satu dua tiga
ah faham tak
rather than I have that might as well ada one two three
then one two three then in the middle put cermin
that place kita buat walk-in wardrobe
that short yang dia cakap yang the one that you say is short walkway tu kan
ah that one kita buat walk-in wardrobe ah instead of dia buat macam gitu L shaped
we tambah lagi satu gini tapi yang tu yang dalam tu the one inside
kita pecah kan
three macam gini
ah this like this wardrobe but three macam gini ah ni this is three
tak tak tak this dua pintu is three inside
then kat bawah sini ada
ah laci correct ah that one is one two three
then in the middle I want to put macam baju gantung untuk kat atas tu gantung panjang
from here to here sampai hujung
gantung tapi in the middle I want to put macam satu drawer
apa nama dia ah macam taruk jam jam ke
ah jam jam ke ah your accessories ke
can see through apa nama dia panggil tu
cermin eh not cermin
kat situ ah
because it's two faham tak it's two
so tempat siap is tengah tengah sini and then depan sini is ah
apa yang got space to walk of course lah got space to walk
got space to walk maksudnya
unless I want to take my baju lah
tak kan tak boleh tepi sikit tepi sikit
tak kan tak boleh
tepi sikit no
so kalau gini jalan senget
boleh pe
so the cermin okay the the ya is like this cermin
exactly beside that macam table macam gini tapi rendah sikit with a cermin
if you don't want cermin also can
then just satu table jer lah kat situ
satu table macam gini ah
like this kind ah like macam this this kind of laci ah
corner seat okay juga
then bawah ni semua is not our stuff
boleh juga up to you
can this one you want to take out pun boleh pecah kan taruk yang glass
but then not nice lah kan dalam kalau berselerak abeh orang macam mm
definitely berselerak
then the katil
my side dekat dengan tingkap
or you want to dekat dengan tingkap which one
then my side of the bed ada satu meja kecil jer bukan meja macam gini
dia meja kecil jer
bed side table pun boleh lah
mm then in sorang is a
ah apa taruk projector kan
kat mana nak taruk projector tu
tak ya your projector will project the image on the wall but where do you want to put the projector
you want to gantung dekat ceiling
or you want to gantung dekat atas katil
no lah I mean buat satu macam
not rak ah ya maybe rak
buat satu macam rak gitu then taruk kat situ
somewhere around here pun
waste of space might as well you just tampal tampal tampal everything on your
murah punya ah
if five room berapa how much harga dia
if four room berapa harga dia
tapi dia cakap five room
not my pasal what
correct what not my pasal what
tak tahu pula eh
if malaysia boleh
we also boleh mah
mm tak ada apa
check lah we check like macam bawah bowl ke bowl seat bowl tu ke apa ke
tak lah I think the sanitisation tak include cleaning ke
ah apa nama dia they will have a
jet no they don't need the jet spray you nak
dia nak scrub apa lantai
ye they have that they have that apa nama dia
orh I'm okay ah tapi lately rabak ah because uh apa ni COVID kan so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
atau just uh watch new dramas lah basically
correct correct then the one that I regret the most sekarang is uh apa ni the one that you invited me to watch ah demon slayer
for me personally right ah uh aku bukan a fan of apa ni macam cute cute uh type of err art style for the err anime for me I prefer like macam semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret gila serious because it's like uh the storyline bagus and then like dia punya action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away ah so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right uh it was
that's why but err but err adding on to yang the older punya animes even initial D pun kan it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then macam it got so much hype and like so much um err attention right it just blows my mind ah ya and I really thought it's it's really nice lah and
not gonna lie ah it's very rare um for this kind of err shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause ah the part yang
err I think is the one yang the second episode yang dia pergi bunuh the very big demon then he touch the head
uh ya the the the one who killed the punya kawan
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was um the apa moon that got strip of his uh power pasal dia tak uh eat enough humans the one who use the drums ah
ya uh I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then tak ada orang appreciate dia so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
uh terkesan like I was like shocked lah when I cried a bit I was like eh tak pernah pernah macam gini the last time I cried was like err what endgame
kompang kompang gitu
err tapi tapi stress ah yang err dia punya battle tu the other one that err was more stressful was the punya the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
sekali a one time slash then mati
that's why tak fair gila serious
ya ya even the intro dia punya what they call it opening I don't know opening ah the opening was also quite macam blood pumping ah for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally eh for you is the music kan for me is the ah story line itself
um uh give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect macam dia tak just bunuh cause oh you're a demon cause err he take the time to like understand them look back ah look through their memories and then like say like eh you used to be human lah so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
I I kind of uh apa ni regret a bit right apart from um not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that err to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime ah like macam I look macam ah sometimes look at the art style macam very cutesy cutesy dia macam takda substance to it ah but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some animes are good it's not everytime macam those like uh act cute atau macam very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the animes are really damn good so aku macam semi regret so for me personally ah for demon slayer right I started on naruto
um ah I know it's one of the best animes but draggy gila it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch ah but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also ah the day before pasal one piece so that one will try so I start naruto first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer naruto or one piece ah actually
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes lah so it's not too not too macam mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya tapi are these sorry is this the format for err anime like each episode got twenty minutes atau
oh kira macam movie is it
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm hilang ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking ni kan sekarang ah apa ni uh I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
ya I see your math semalam jer dah tak boleh tahan that's why I I don't take math
correct correct yang semalam you show me the pasal apa tu row operation that one obviously I try ah but I really I really don't understand lah but the first few question I understand lah ya
ah something like that ya ya but sorry my math tak bagus sangat
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you ah force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself tak faham then you have to like uh you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt juga
yeah I guess macam uh if like you if you like tanya then like you didn't try then think macam people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really kalau macam we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about uh your course is that uh at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally rabak gila ah ah I take english but then like err if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment juga
ya ya cause mak kau cikgu ya ya ya that's why it's it's true ah like I I always thought I had the mindset like boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri just belajar jer just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you ah they call it um crystallisation of your thinking like make your uh ah word flow much more uh smoother ah in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya eh tak tak I I saw in my study guide apa crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation uh like um basically they encourage macam um making study groups and all that cause for me like uh like you err yourself ah aku pun introvert that time um when I want to try ask macam malu-malu cause I feel paiseh ah like macam
oh kira macam the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe ah
in a way ah in the same time at the same time from what you explain macam is to juggle the perasaan of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
um some um I think it's very rare lah that there are people who are very macam clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to jaga hati and try to be more mindful what they say
as very um ruthless or very blunt lah macam later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel macam very um
ah that's why that's why rasa kecil hati kirakan ya
ah then when they continue doing that then they don't learn kan they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise asal semua orang keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me masa dulu I was very sensitive so now I try to macam balance out lah
ya can I share one story ya okay pasal I'm guilty of this so err so err err err the the one thing that err you mentioned about time management there is it for me kan honestly speaking ah
balance and all that so I admit ah sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so um before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I uh consulted err my partner and my mother then they said that is fine lah then I think about it macam tak affect my grade cause there was a time before what I failed my exam then my uh drop rabak gila then lepas tu um
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like um if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just err restudy lah and the good thing ah about my school now is that since COVID right uh they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right uh you have to pay the fee tau it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free lah cause of COVID so like I'll just do it lah but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty macam I feel so bad macam kirakan I can clear the mod one then macam I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again uh cause uh the last time I checked if I fail again kan
aku boleh tendang sekolah lah like fully ah I err I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is err academic termination then you have to it's as if err after you kena terminated it's as if you have to err re-enrolled lah to the school so that's the downside lah so I'm like ah I don't wanna take the risk ah I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away kena that kind of
ah ah that's what I kena ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos ah if I'm being honest so like I think about it ah takpe lah just resit ah
I don't want to risk it ya sakit sia hati that time ya
uh are there but how there are different so that um when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english eh I'm if I'm speaking english and kau cakap macam ah there are structures to it that make it different ah I think it's ah sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages ah
ya something like that lah like they have a uh a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences ah ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages ah if like you use uh malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like susah
it's a translation but then like err one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like err the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part ah ya I think there was once I I look err the one that my prof taught me was err apa ni
professor ya sorry err professor ah eh ah so casual panggil prof uh she talk about english in uh do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya allah eh sorry sorry err so basically um
pejabat office right
ah pejabat pos so it's like it's reverse ah so that's the different thing
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it ah so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so panjang right so like ah tau boleh takpe lah just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly uh change it like that like um they just make it english language and literature like um why they don't have the presets cause last time uh when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that um
ya tak comfortable
correct ya cause nanti err it will be natural
for you to start comparing with others tau then nanti macam okay for example you got a posh you nampak orang ni ada Ferrari then you see ah people got um apa Burgundy Burgundy Honda then later you get Burgundy Honda later you got Ducati it never ends tau so like when you keep buying more things like this you think like um err you're making yourself happy cause you are getting everything you want since you are a kid what tapi what you're doing right is you are sort of uh
apa ni putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you
unfortunately he died already ah it's iron man games of thrones tak game of thrones tak that uh one prime uh character in the Marvel uh
uh adding to your part macam uh when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually uh apa ni
belief and then like ah actually um it's not technically a superpower lah but it's more of like it's err apa tu
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing eh cause I just realised this now I'm having this uh eh epiphany macam if you notice eh in endgame
uh black widow and iron man tak ada power tau but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then uh iron man dia uh take the apa tu uh gauntlet from err thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really ah all the efforts for nothing but then like err he managed to get all the infinity stones on his uh hand then he just snap ah so it takes a lot of um courage to do that you know so like it was is is really um mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
ya macam that day jer this is the type of body that you want on the beach oh my goodness
ah dah kurus ya ya
dan cause also um
like it's even more um ah amplified lah I guess lagi lagi malu lah kirakan
tak boleh ah some do play some do play not going to lie tapi um
ya sebab but it's more suited for the mature audience ah
eh tak lari eh topic lari that's why
okay okay takpe takpe go jer
kat mars
dia pergi eh
atau Grab express uh deliver parcel
young ah wah that's a good thing eh like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any apa tu
ya ya orh then err it'll be relatable to uh demon slayer when uh in the movie uh what's his name eh ah correct me if I'm wrong ah asaka ke akaza akaza he wanted to offer uh rengoku to be a a demon what ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die ah so
um if you remain at technically if you get to live forever atau you um remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it uh like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
but probably why ah sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable ah err probably why the apa six demon didn't uh
okay so after that the third year engkau move out because with your aunty and then
ya but is it your own your own punya feeling or memang they are the one who gave you hints
tapi when you go back that time uh like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
ya ya but you and her now dah okay lah
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree lah you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life lah mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy lah you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my nakal my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school lah they get into they they start to steal from shop lah that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument ah so aku suka jawab jer you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum lah you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course lah you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you lah you know you ended up becoming a fight often ah but for our case is not religious matters lah for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche lah because she was a single mother for awhile
ah so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so macam ah ya ya so I can understand her stress ah she was the old school hard knocks kind lah you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind lah if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness lah so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and um I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
ah when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two err I stayed at uh you know those government rental house ya I I stayed uh using uh someone's name lah ya because that person had was sick so she uh the nenek like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus lah ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely lah I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area uh my my house was at outram there the old school jalan kukoh lah you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better ah
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot lah and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay uh when when I was in my early twenties kita actually nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah so by right we already moved to yishun way back already tau but then err this err it's a it's a chinese family lah so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house ah so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room lah my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us lah but you can feel lah after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like rimas if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate lah then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you lah the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight lah like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve tau but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her alah she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke you know
passionate ah kira defensive ah
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example lah uh you know like how sometimes people um okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very nya one the nya one ah actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before ah wah sometimes when people in the level of managerial position ah are sometimes very guai lan you know bro dia orang
ya lah but no lah I truly mean it empathise lah kau jangan ketawa now you make me feel bad for laughing
eh but dude I thought all this while memang you were actually very motivated to be a pilot what no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about macam mana kau jadi pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid tau not the interest tau the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
oo sayangnya
eh no lah because new house you say you use mah you don't have to cash contribute what ada how much
eh but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know nasib kentang eh like like first okay lah the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID pula happen like wow
your nasib is so kentang lah dude
nasib kau sangat kentang bro I don't know why I say kentang ah but I feel like it sounds right nasib kau kentang
another ujian
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to salihin ni edwin jadi nyanyuk ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there orang yang dalam asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you siol lah funny sia
siol ah kau
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story lah I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist ah so she's like a old lady lah you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage lah like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just macam smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing what you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you kena arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you kena arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing lah as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see lah
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand mah so aku anytime can just like you know eh
he's a new zealander but sekarang he stay in australia
no it's not about mahal bro even if it's not mahal you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand macam mana if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example lah like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and um I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say oh my house will kena tarik they will say oh I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
the only reason how they can tarik your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house kena tarik not true okay number two uh you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy uh I give you one one scenario lah one of one of this person oh like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount lah so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
because your will still cut mah bulan-bulan for the house ah okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you ah bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years lah depending on the amount that you have to pay err so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that one right they are the people like ah fuck it lah I don't want to pay aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat ah so if they never pay then they cannot travel
but it's not like so long in advance pun you know it's just like a day probably you know ah but the thing is people thought oh cannot that kind of thing
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will tambah balik one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario lah so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay lah let's say you you a newly married couple lah okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans mah
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay habis kan another thing kan macam the second way let's say macam the minimum eh some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the susu pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come lah lawyer letter come lah
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic ah this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see lah they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country lah ah so ah normally they have their debt consolidation plan lah that debt management program lah all these thing lah this is by the by the banks lah of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria lah you know you are eh aku rasa dah habis ah bro okay lah five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done ah okay
alamak minta tolong apa
alamak tutup eh tapi today today saturday kan normally weekend sabtu ahad buka apa okay mm
doesn't matter where tapi nak kena dekat ke nak delivery ke nak apa
mm I think for me kalau recommendation I recommend just nearby kalau since you're going out already might as well pergi to err minang minang
I forgot the name ah minang house I think minang or minang house I know of a few so that one yang popular dia dekat dengan masjid sultan just in front so kalau you masuk from the
eh from the back I think boleh tapi from the side lah the side gate you just park there then
masuk maybe like lima minute jalan lima minute
then mesti nampak mm mm
selalu long queue lah every time tapi the only thing is you have to go with your parents early lah kalau tidak lunch time selalu wah the queue is like gila like oh my god like you can see
I don't know dua puluh orang dalam queue
tak boleh tak boleh buat reservation ah just queue I mean I don't see them taking reservation lah because dia punya tempat macam macam biasa macam kedai kopi tapi dia macam atas punya kedai kopi sikit ah cause boleh ada two storey so and it's like a shophouse so definitely I don't think they take reservations but
ya lor just walk in lor but I mean kalau you want just go maybe pukul sebelas
mm ya sebelas setengah sebelas setengah for lunch tapi because dinner normally err I think tutup
um ya so I think kalau nasi padang kalau nak makan fresh you makan lunch lah jangan pergi dinner dinner
susah lah kalau nasi kalau you know lauk kalau basi sakit perut seh
tapi tu apa tu err singaporean yang buka apa
ke indonesian
orh okay interesting I mean cause from what I know kalau nasi padang normally lah selalu lunch kalau dinner I don't know I mean the the other one that I know is at paragon tapi that one is in a mall lah
and be be prepared to pay like I don't know I don't know I on average lah macam empat puluh lebih lima puluh lebih because dalam paragon you know lah it's an atas mall so tambuah mas
tu also very popular because last time you know lah tourist selalu pergi and then
err I think it's at basement basement one or basement one or two lah hmm so you can expect the place to be a bit more atas lah
ya lah you know lah situ beli gucci lah lah prada lah ya lah kalau ada duit lah kalau tak ada duit then different story lah tengok-tengok jer boleh lah kan tengok tak ada tak tak ada duit apa tak minta duit eh
mm try lah I think that one is one of the popular ones but I think makan situ lagi sedap
eh lepas ni nak pergi mana
pergi shopping ke
go earlier lah nowadays because aiya you know lah sekarang because of the pandemic alamak macam macam like nak masuk mall jer nak check in check out then like ambil temperature lah abeh mall lain habis store lain
abeh every store you go you have to take your temperature my god it's like I mean after awhile I don't know for you and your parents but I like for me when I go with my mum it's like penat seh just masuk keluar masuk keluar
like non stop and then kalau tak kalau tak ambil temperature tak ambil tak masuk dekat safe entry thing tak boleh masuk
even if you want to go for like five minutes also tak boleh
I don't know whether you experience that before some shops okay and then some shops tak okay I'm like really like come on lah like give chance a bit lah like you know but I guess everyone has to take it seriously lah that is true tapi macam kelakar because at the beginning bila this started semua orang macam alamak kanchiong kanchiong spider you know macam alamak
okay how ah macam how to check in how know contact tracing lah this and that and then after that after awhile
I think right the best kalau ada duit beli online sudah
uh uh betul memang memang my mum also experience that before dia beli apa lah kelakar it's not just baju eh it's like barang-barang rumah sekali after that dia punya colour lain and then dia punya size pun lain
ada boleh lah ada like macam all those order macam order from china all that how to how to return back seh
no gambar cantik selalu gambar cantik makanan pun sama every time kalau order grab dia punya gambar alamak macam photoshopnya wah it's really like damn atas the photo
and then sekali datang like that time okay it's funny that time eh I'm sure you mesti you ada story pasal like failed grab delivery punya apa tu
punya orders my god my my time bila I mean my experience so far is like oh my god
like it's really crazy like okay example leh that time I beli ayam penyet and then you know what happen nasi tak datang boleh gitu order ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet tau tapi nasi
tak ada and then bila bila complain dengan dia orang firstly dia orang tak angkat phone abeh dah dah gitu and then nak tanya lah
mana mana nasi kan nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang order nasi lemak tak ada nasi order nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar
and then dah lapar and then after that dia orang boleh cakap oh I think the nasi dia orang either dia orang lupa atau driver makan huh tak I don't know nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa
you imagine if it's you kalau if it's your if you are in my shoes tak marah
nak nak tunggukan nasi and then takkan so the the kelakar part is the kelakar part of the story is what know
bila I call them to go and say that the nasi tak ada and then dia cakap so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say ah tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke and then
kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa tau dia cakap ma'am because right the restaurant err a lot of order ah ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait ah maybe one or two hours untuk satu nasi I'm like ah
tak payah lah in the end my mum masak nasi sendiri ah so thanks lah so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
satu jam eh eh kalau I mesti dah
dah membara you know like dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk
abeh still nak tunggu satu jam eh tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli mcdonald's sudah
ya lah masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak clean up tu nak bersihkan eh tak payah lah
ah wah mesti crowded gila ah
abeh huh cancel
eh eh jahatnya sedih
so I think also susah lah macam the restaurant nak blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end siapa yang suffer seh
dia punya gaji bukannya berapa seh kesian mm mm
tu lah I mean I selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal lah dengan motor lah dengan kereta lah and then
selalu macam you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun alamak macam susah you know macam kesian ah macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya
apa tu dia orang punya job lah like tapi tak tahu eh macam let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer lah
eh eh baiknya lah eh eh siapa seh tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu as in tip in cash or huh oh my god
mm mm betul
mm betul
mm mm betul
tu lah lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua still ada comment lah singaporeans standard lah kalau tak complain bukan singaporean apa
susah lah nak order macam like that time baru my friend order apa eh I think dia order
susah kalau I mean that time my friend pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang eh that time my friend order during bulan puasa ah during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk lah because dia orang ada macam
apa macam err open house eh bukan open house macam
err family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be lah you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is dia hantar banyak rumah so they order macam maybe like four packet like empat packet satu rumah
so altogether maybe about empat puluh packet they just put you know lah
malay family banyak kan
so dia baik hati lah because like one of the days dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the makanan basi ah dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi and then macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan
so dia punya order datang pukul empat
and then dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas and then after that makanan dia basi so satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih
ah abeh yang kelakar punya yang the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that err food stall dia boleh cakap apa tau oh err sorry ah to customer who got the food that is basi
ah ah so also kelakar lah because okay lah kalau macam restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you macam a bit of refund or what lah but because they are
correct and then nasi I mean okay nasi padang eh maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month eh plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus tau then imagine half of the nasi basi macam mana gitu
tak ada tak ada tak ada refund tak ada dia boleh cakap oh we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya lah tu lah kesian and then it's like macam
pergi mana cycling kat mana seh
boleh juga lah eh tapi esok sunday seh confirm banyak orang
oh masih
ah ah sama mountain bike ah sama tak tak tak tukar
mm I think makan apa err cinema tempat wayang kan masih tutup kan oh dah buka eh tapi dia punya gambar semua macam gambar dulu-dulu jer siapa seh nak tengok
mm mm I think sekarang that day I think what lima puluh or something like that
boleh lah sounds like a plan bro
eh tapi kat changi banyakkan dia punya tempat yang nasi lemak macam semua semua best nasi lemak so semua semua kalau tanya mana satu yang bagus dia cakap ah semua semua famous tak tahu I think I don't know like five
six five or six stalls there right that jual nasi lemak or is it is it more than that I can't remember dah lama seh tak pergi makan changi tapi as usual kalau nak tanya orang
mana best nasi lemak semua best ah depends ah yang mana depends on apa like you suka tapi more or less sama apa selalu nasi ayam ikan timun sambal dah kan apa apa yang beza dia
kan unless it's sama apa kalau nasi lemak I mean okay lah the good thing is that dia punya price there is like macam dua I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya
uh uh dia punya nasi punya banyak I always I always ingat dia punya ada dia punya stall kasih lauk banyak abeh ada nasi macam macam walao like mountain like that know makan tak habis
mm ya lah standard kalau makcik kalau kasi wah very generous then kalau senyum-senyum sikit nanti mesti dapat lebih
okay boleh mm
okay lah boleh lah hopefully tak hujan seh sekarang kalau weather you know lah macam unpredictable that day punya lah panas I think I check the temperature you know what's the temperature thirty four degrees seh thirty four degrees tapi
kalau you tengok iphone punya app kan dia punya degrees ada macam ada macam feels like ah macam macam actually
feels like is forty two eh wah forty forty two dah macam dekat dubai seh
ah ah tu lah it's like and then kelakar kan because nowadays bila panas very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time dekat dekat singapore I think kat mana entah changi ke pasir ris ke bedok the rain sampai flooding sampai banjir and then the banjir is so bad that
at the bus stop dia punya orang is standing on the seat eh
and the air naik all the way tau
macam bukan kat singapore seh
a'ah betul a'ah betul betul
ya and then I saw seh banyak orang macam video
and apa tu banyak orang video of the incident that happen then like one of them is so funny because kan at that point of time you it's like I think I don't know lah since circuit breaker or something like that
or phase one or something then the dia punya it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus leh and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers habis lah
basah kuyup seh habis ah
kesian uh uh tu lah that's why it's like really not like singapore seh
and then means weather forecast semua salah lah
tu lah like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain dia cakap actually suppose hujan sampai tuesday ah next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today punya lah panas mana tak dengue kat singapore
weird leh no but talking about dengue oh my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day pasal the dengue case and then one of my colleague boleh kena dengue seh uh uh and the kelakar part dia mat salleh
dia dia asyik I think dia asyik keluar petang ah pergi jogging ke apa entah lah tak ingat lah apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap oh I I was out sick for one week so I said lah how are you so I thought maybe um like he fever ke cause you know lah nowadays kalau sakit it's like either you kena COVID nineteen or you kena
dengue and then the funny part is dia cakap dia kena dengue
uh uh confirm and then dia dah takut because they dia ingatkan that kena masuk hospital lah so actually tak payah because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
I I I don't know how he got it I think dia cakap that maybe because dia selalu keluar petang ah dia keluar petang to go jogging around dia punya area and dia standard lah dia tinggal dia tinggal kat robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area ah then after that
err don't know how he balik and then dia macam dia pening lah abeh dia batuk-batuk lah and then dia macam
dia rasa macam something is wrong lah so dia cakap actually dia pergi doctor first time then doctor say oh maybe you're just tired because dia sekarang kan everybody work from home ah then after that dia ingatkan
okay lah maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end dia pergi to another doctor the doctor cakap dengue then dia dah panic lah
so dia macam eh macam mana ni macam mana seh so dia dia takut that dia kena hospitalize lah because kalau hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
p[a'ah tu lah and then nowadays you know lah kalau ambil is not like those days lah ah like dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi I mean ambil boleh lah one two days stay at home sekarang is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss semua tahu habis seh
is it tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak
abeh macam mana seh dia orang nak check macam I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay lah I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like err kat apa tu at the west side I think yishun or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day ada fogging ah
and then fogging you know lah the smell oh my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in yishun and woodlands they say every other day ada fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell macam nak muntah seh and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
my mum even funnier bila dia dengar pasal these dengue cases and then like because that day I read it was ten thousand so then when I was talking to my ang moh colleague the the guy then his then err he said he doesn't know lah that because they ang moh apa he from sweden ah dia tak dia tak dia tak baca local news sangat lah baca pasal COVID nineteen COVID nineteen
and the pandemic and everything that's happening in the world lah then but then he never read about the dengue then he said oh I didn't know that dengue was a very big thing so I said ya it's actually ten thousand cases sekali I read on the day itself is already more than twenty two thousand cases eh it's crazy my god
tapi macam mana seh
macam mana nak tengok kalau even if your eyesight is like perfect eyesight macam mana nak tengok
by the time they want to gigit you they just gigit
so leceh lah sekarang kalau kalau sakit then susah tau nak kena pergi doctor lah nak kena self self isolate lah then macam-macam ah like macam-macam test seh nak kena
nak kena ambil is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know lah is hard to predict right ya so kalau dah
I don't know lah just keep healthy lah ah just keep on exercising makan betul-betul jangan makan all the
he just drink water a lot everyday because dia tak ada medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary ah
macam-macam lah nowadays
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day mesti ada something you know and it's only what august oh my god
ya lah ya lah betul susah lah
ya lor that's why how seh they check everyday like that tak penat ke macam
mm mm ya lah that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see lah the weather like panas lah hujan lah then all the air bertakung like that then mana tak dengue seh ya then there's nobody like
because my house area ada banyak new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks macam seram seh like so quiet mm so I guess lah because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
more and more ya mm mm betul lah correct
ah ah betul lah kesian eh
mm mm tu lah makan maggi jer lah hari-hari they are also heroes ah mm mm
no lah work from home lah because office tak buka then how
mm mm kat raffles leh oh my god
sama ah
mm mm tu lah
correct and then kalau you know lah kalau lunch time situ not only crowded like raffles and area I mean most times you are like spending so much on your lunch like you know you know lunch you know the lunches are like what
ten to fifteen dollars on average and then and that's like every other day kalau makan luar jer dah mahal imagine like five times a day five times a week you have to do that walao like it's a lot of money you know
correct like all the small small things ah like I think you spend less lah when you're working from home and like we're staying home more often you really just spend on like the essential items like groceries and like you know just the things that you really need I mean clothes also you want to buy nak pergi shopping nak beli apa seh
electricity bill lah bill air bill api
mm mm betul
mm ya a lot of a lot of emphasis is on work life balance nowadays ah I mean you tengok ah kalau
whatever lah like macam you are
kelakar right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees eh completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal lah you know what I mean
kalau tidak susah macam mana seh macam like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
every every singaporean loves you know mm mm like that day apa tu baru national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend
tu lah
mm mm betul nak fourteen fourteen days leceh lah nak pakai mask lah pakai ni lah and then I don't know like the amount of money that you're spending is not worth it lah
virtual workout virtual makeup I think that day I baru nampak virtual makeup session then like
like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day baru I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
mm mm betul betul lah netflix eh netflix hari-hari
ya lah tapi the amount of things on netflix you can watch is
homerun even like malay shows I think what bunga tanjung or something like that that they have so it's quite interesting and it's like they have diverse range lah like malay english they even have like tamil shows and all that it's quite interesting like I mean I guess
I think dah buka lah but like I mean you have to take precaution right
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say lah just go out for awhile then balik cepat-cepat you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks seh oh my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that oh the fireworks you have to do at padang because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year oh my god so many different places kat tampines ada kat jurong I think is it
once every four years right mm mm millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the duit
mm ya ya lah betul lah
boleh nyanyi mm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you rasa like macam-macam lah you rasa marah lah you rasa sedih lah you rasa ni lah macam-macam
macam-macam perasaan tapi at the end of the day mesti positive lah you know kalau tak positive susah seh I mean hari-hari takkan I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive lah of course some days kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke just feel all your emotions and then
tak penat ke eh mm mm mm mm
betul no lah and also you complain
mm mm betul mm mm
ah ni kalau ni singaporean kalau tak complain bukan singaporean kan
mm mm betul I mean there's good and bad lah I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know macam
mm betul
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask lah right I mean ya I mean singapore nak semua orang kena pakai mask
tak payah pakai mask
so like macam suka-suka jer then I like
eh boleh ah I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory lah for all but then I guess
jaga diri baik-baik lah you know kalau pakai nak pakai up to you lah you know
semua nak jadi famous ah semua tak ada kerja nak jadi famous ah so okay lah so dia orang tak nak pakai mask then like I guess
tu lah
bukannya mahal ke the mask ada I think what less than one dollar you can get already
uh tu lah

cepat habis ah minyaknya like tak concentrated you know so I'm like what's happening here ah

okay lah ya I mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy macam chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap sia
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like macam you go to jinjja chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or ah it's that one lah macam gitu but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like macam got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone lah got a lot of different flavour ah like all those the chicken chicken flavour so

ah nak cakap pasal orang tak
tak senonoh gitu eh
orang kasih assignment kita mengumpat
okay okay ya alright kita jadi serious um apa kita nak berbual eh um
uh kita punya keluarga or okay no lah no lah ah shares lah stock market lah eh
so um you ada any investment you you dah buat ke or anything you nak recommend
but I tak tahu because sekarang nak beli tesla mahal tak mampu though
I think kalau I I will beli the stock uh for what I have now lah my capital yang ada I would probably invest in cheaper stocks lah singapore based stocks like
uh old chang kee for example err murah jer you tahu tak old chang kee dia punya share price is err enam puluh satu sen saje tau ah serious a'ah betul tu then kalau you ada macam seratus ke dua ratus dollar then you akan
berbaloi lah then I I I mean ah I was looking at their annual report then old chang kee kan
dia orang akan open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like macam the demand for asian foods are rising tapi supply tak banyak
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region kan then agaknya I would think lah it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like um they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend lah so I mean that's my thing lah cause sekarang I don't think I I boleh mampu lah tesla mahal saje
ya tapi itu my thing lah on stocks
tapi masalahnya some some stocks dia orang tak how to say dia orang tak syariah on client tau so nanti dia orang tak
tak boleh lah kita tak boleh ambil dia punya um benefits lah from that stocks so ya I don't know lah I tak tahu lah ni semua islamic financial ah you tahu tak anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it lah that time I went for this uh website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get syariah pampasan or not
so it's very interesting because macam they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's uh allowed or not haram or halal lah in that sense tapi the problem with that website ah they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you kena bayar
then I'm like alamak then you muslim pun nak buat duit
nak tengok stocks halal ke tak
but I would say it's good lah like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very macam you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay lah that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
ya I think bagus lah kita sekarang err I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive lah
so ya bagus bagus bagus
you rasa
you rasa
good tak stocks
ya anyway err betul tu ya but I heard kan itu kalau you nak pakai wahed invest then
ada some fees involved right like apa tu
um okay apa eh nak bilang you oh ya anyway I I found out there is days
technically grow your money but with very low return lah so macam kalau you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you tak nak letak it in the bank lah
because firstly kalau you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the hibah tak banyak
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new saham returns tapi tak banyak the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like uh macam it's like a savings account with a little bit more uh
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
wasted lah I think like a lot of people macam lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are tak halal
ya lah wasted kalau dia orang tak invest in bonds then kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam seh if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
can lah nanti I call dia orang
ya lah I call lah I call lah I bilang lah kenapa ni right
for the idea of islamic finance because technically um you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also macam in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore macam not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
interest yielding accounts and maybe dia orang tak tahu lah it's haram because you would need to kind of know mah yang kita tak boleh yang interest and all bonds are tak halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya kita terus deep eh berbual
ya ya ya betul betul betul I was looking at um the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting lah because uh one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are err they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
SOCOE will be a good tapi I pun macam tak faham sangat lah how how the SOCOE um investment works but halal kan dia kan so boleh lah eh
oh kita punya trip eh ah I tak tahu lah I I punya adik kejap eh I call my adik hello
adik I baru kentut adik I kentut adik I lepas ni nak kena
I tak tahu dia punya ada like a mix of a and I don't know dia makan apa tapi bau dia like one kind you know toxic toxic
kentut ah I think maybe yes lah dia nak eating lah agaknya rasa gitu ah
ya ya itu I I I tu tak okay ha ha so anyway um
nak pergi makan I pun lapar sekarang belum makan so I pun nak pergi makan actually kan is hafizah going or not to sedap mania like what what do you think the chances are
mm mm ya lor actually semua pun dah agree apa sunday semua okay
aiyo unless kita just go somewhere to like makan lor
then after that we just lepak then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like lepak and makan lor
I would think maybe seletar cafe will be good tapi sana makanan dia tak halal so mana kita boleh makan oh maybe we can eat at seletar airport the mister teh tarik express dia tu mahal ke
I tak tahu what are good things for us to makan eh err
okay lah nanti I berbual dengan I punya adik lah mana kita nak pergi
but ya lah kita try lah I I pun lapar eh I I want to eat sedap mania
ah tengok ubin also
eh I didn't know tau ubin ada macam malay punya makcik jual I just recently found out I'm like what
ya lah okay tak nanti I kena banyak pujuk adik I lah
betul betul tu eh oh ya by the way just now I was looking at sedap mania punya website then uh
they have a lunch promo I think it's seven dollars or eight dollars and eighty or like macam let's say chicken set then you get your own in individual soup base then you get your own
sayur-sayuran condiments lah then you boleh like you know it's your own personalised then it's like eight dollar eighty cents tapi dia punya timing it's only from eleven thirty to two thirty so it's like actually during the lunch hours
ya ya kita dah missed confirm lah
ya besok lah I I okay juga kalau esok besok I think besok confirm tak ramai orang eh kalau pergi lunch lagi confirm kosong habis
it actually it sounds like a plan you know let me see ah besok monday I think I got nothing on
kita terus pergi ubin I boleh tapi perempuan I don't think dia orang pergi sebab besok christina I think dia kena exam so I think she cannot then hafizah dia nak ke
boleh juga kita cycle ke ubin
oh what's new ah like or rather what because december semua holidays we should like explore more places
marsiling tanya lah
car lite I think is err I think kalau the most expensive one right is err four dollars per four or six dollars per fifteen minutes
tak jadi lah gini
actually one hour eight dollar blue oh tak lah blue blue lagi mahal lah
I haus so ini air mineral water eh
eh a'ah lah kita minum air sama
oh tak lah ini kecil punya meadows
ya ya ya ya correct imagine dia orang tak
tak catch the fizz thingy then they just let people drink then they just let people drink wah
like err what's that word aniaya
eh takde lah sampai gitu
apa lagi kita boleh berbual pasal pasal entah lah
ah macam nak baca buku berbual buku tapi
tak boleh kan
biscoff itu tak boleh dah
ah ya sekarang I see biscoff dekat out of stock kat lazada out of stock
semalam I pergi cold storage ada stock so baru beli lah ya
makan lah sedap tu I buat cake pakai biscoff
coconut oil I I tak jual I beli pasal itu for rambut bagus sama rambut I sekarang macam berang kan so bagus ah bagus moisturising
alamak apa jadi
gini lah I sekarang
nak find ideas lah want to like the social mission
tapi I pun tak tahu so in singapore apa social mission you can solve
mana boon keng is it
at this block block block sebelas eh
ada yang sebelah main road tu yang you pass by satu block macam horizontal
ah block block tu I dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak eh block tu ada dadah semua I heard a lot of stories you know about the block
oh distant eh jauh lah tu
nama dia Q
ya so macam mana you tahu ni Q tinggal kat boon keng
I see I see ya I mean is is it because dia tinggal kat boon keng takde bapa ke tinggal boon keng pasal takde bapa
I I curious lah macam you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
oh dengan datuk dia
contohnya apa khabar eh are you close with the datuk
mak dia doctor apa though
like wah so I mean not bad eh walaupun dia tinggal at risk block mak dia doctor
kencang seh then kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak take her out you know
ah psychology you pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
bagus bagus bagus very good
I actually now you speaking of which ah I think I met someone like this you know tak tahu orang sama ke this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the boon keng area then there was this doctor dan dia punya kucing
so I was like tapi dia tengah pakai white coat lah eh doctor dengan kucing
ah a'ah lah agaknya vet I mean we don't know lah pasal career banyak
but I mean okay lah so maknya consider good lah doctor
good lah tapi anaknya
um I tak tahu I heard anak dia
ah I don't know how I heard lah where I heard lah agaknya kat mothership anak dia macam
apa seorang ah sampai or rather act a bit pelik you know
maybe dia punya anak needs treatment lah like like do you think so
a'ah lah agaknya lah however tak tahu
ya ya ya betul tu maybe what we can do is we can actually find this um Q your distant relative we can ajak her lah go makan oh maybe sedap mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
duit so
lagi more reason lah takde lah takde lah
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true lah if someone is put in that environment they kind of macam angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you takde you know outlet boleh keluarkan the perasaan
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally lah eh macam mana her eh I tau eat him or her up like internally
mm ah kenapa ni
um sentosa I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump itu I tak berani
tramp punya trail then we just macam
you cannot claim compensation lah because it's at your own risk mah you masuk tempat gitu so
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good lah cause kalau kalau tak then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
can also then luge macam laju lah a bit too fast don't you think so
morning will be best tapi
we can go malam lah or we can go like in the evening macam cold kan begitu so macam sunset
dia tak panas sangat and ya
not pergi maghrib I mean
mm okay okay then then good lah I would think of saturday banyak orang but it should be fine lah should be fine lah
I I sekarang tengah tengok harga per the hit rock mahal juga
ya ya that that's the lowest yang ada but other one is seven rides seventy five dollars and one ride is only five minutes yo
a'ah lah laju sangat ah
wait ah let me see ah apa lagi kita boleh buat dekat sana because it's only participating attractions so uh
eh I heard dia banyak burung uh okay anyway I tengok hit rock actually ada boleh lah err
blue zone one ride is fifteen token so boleh lah mampu kalau you nak two rides from green orange or blue zone
oh okay oh okay sea aquarium pun the token so boleh mampu
boleh juga then a bit boring actually boleh lah because ten token saje apa bukan ke tiga puluh apa
tapi I tak tahu boleh combine ke tak because it's their giant swing
bukan I think is bungee jump I don't know it's just says giant swing plus skyride plus ice cream fifty five token
tapi I takut lah I don't think I I can lah
eh ni macam interesting juga eh
ya naik segway
let me see eh kayak eh takde lah
takde kayak
actually we can take cable car I I pun tak pernah naik so if you want we can take the sentosa one just three dollars mah
ya ya ya so we can do that lah so it sounds like a plan ya I think it it or if you want sentosa island bus tour ten token I mean macam lame lah
mega bounce ten ten token two mega two mega zip sixty five token kira mahal lah mega jump fifteen token
actually kalau nak boleh juga kita boleh ten token lah untuk segway
then lagi the other ten token kita naik this
eh boleh lah you jangan kita kita tak buat banyak banyak benda lah
okay lah adam adam pun nak kan pergi so I ajak my adik also everyone lah this saturday go ramai-ramai
then actually kalau nak kita boleh beli the twelve piece chicken just now I was telling you about the shake shack duck that one
ya so we can buy that one so at the same time we can bring over loaf of bread untuk makan sandwich ke apa
err let me think maybe dekat maple city ah dekat and it's halal so shake shack in a duck
ya betul tu err they have one in great world city
I am sure a bit out of the way ah um unless we can nak kalau nak kita boleh beli dekat ang mo kio hub eh
lapan ada eh eh lapan ada lah ada jer tau kalau kat north kan
a'ah geram I wah not bad eh eh but I don't know whether the promo masih ada tak kalau
twelve dollars I'm not too sure tapi worth it seh twelve dollars
uh I'm not sure about the harga biasa but I think it will be much more than that lah definitely much more than that but actual price I am not too sure actually I pun tak pernah makan I just saw this on the telegram group
so we got two more weeks actually so okay lah that's ons saturday tak boleh lah
ya lah but really looks good lah this section letak yucks okay
ada ada ada buy as you but we can buy or we can take the tram there also lah if you want
so I can just ah so can ya ya so segway I think interesting lah cause one hour dia bawa orang kita jauh-jauh semua
err they say okay so segway one hour eh I salah kot kejap eh
oh dia bukan segway dia bipedal bicycle for one hour
kalau you nak segway fun ride for five hundred meters it's fifteen token
tersalah so lah so the ten token right is for a bipedal bicycle
I I I tak tahu I I would think so
ya depan belakang kan
ya lah kalau begitu kena if you want to take the segway kan the segway eh mana ada
segway is fifteen token tapi five hundred meter saja lah half a
kalau you nak kita boleh pergi ifly
tapi dia punya token hundred and ten
eh okay token dia sixty token kalau you want one skydive
okay lah I mean okay so I think kita kalau nak we can go mega adventure park we can do one mega bound
macam tu lah would be best if we can like have a lot of like different different kind lah activities
ten token for one ride so kalau you nak we can do err one which is like five minutes confirm tak cukup tapi okay lah one one of ride and the other one is err the mega bounce mega zip so ten plus ten
you know that's one way lah we can if you want kita pun boleh pergi sea aquarium also ten token and it's it's a tour open ocean discovery tour sea aquarium
tak eh sedap seh I've been to aspirasi
ya or maybe we can go there makan first at seah im the aspirasi then after that we head into sentosa lah because kan nak naik the monorail also it's free what
tapi nak pergi pukul berapa tu kalau saturday malam sangat nanti kena macam rush
I okay tapi it won't happen one pagi
susah um okay lah we put it about three o'clock kita jumpa
ya three two two or three eh what do you mean force rabung maghrib pe
I think adam pernah pergi force rabung and he he say that is okay leh but he went in the day
ya that's why maybe tonight kalau jumpa then he can tell you more about it lah
kalau jumpa lah ya
so ya lagi tiga minit
eh okay lah so next saturday nineteen kita pergi lah what whatever time lah because I think kalau nak morning is gonna be difficult like habis not possible
two o'clock would be a very macam practical time two to three o'clock
um let me see sea aquarium tutup pukul five
pukul lima on saturday also five but we have a tour so I think if I don't know must follow the tour or own time own target so
aku pernah pe keluar dengan perempuan dua kali
dinner dengan lunch ah
dinner dengan lunch aku bayar siol
pasal aku was like err apa nama dia
aku lupa dinner kita makan apa but
itu pasal apa eh
pasal aku aku nak tengok ah dia offer ke tidak then aku don't mind paying ah
cuma wah kau terus macam diri tepi jer eh
tak cakap apa-apa eh oh okay lor
I mean the fact that that macam
entah macam kena buat pakai ah
just want to have a good fun apa
like macam
macam that time ah macam aku pergi yang aku dekat zouk that time
then ada satu aku tak tahu siapa how the conversation was brought up ah but
berbual jer ah
apa nama dia the si ada satu perempuan tu ah macam
kita nampak satu perempuan then aku tak tahu how it was like ah ni dah lama gila but then satu orang cakap kan alamak but she's
she got boyfriend already ah bro aku pernah cakap ni tak
then after that satu budak ni ah lupa siapa nama dia terus datang he a part of that group ah cakap bro bro
if she's single lah you're fighting with everyone in the club bro dia kata gitu same thing ah
like which not written anywhere where kau ada cakap what I mean but it's an agreement between two people
but the same time if the two people have the agreement like macam kat france they have they have open relationship like I can sleep around whoever I want but at the end of the day I with you that kind of thing kan
like macam that time aku tak boleh tidur ah like
aku tengok Twitter and like romanticism kan
macam wah annoying gila sia
like macam kau expect benda-benda merepek tau everything
like macam benda-benda macam merepek oo sweet nya sweet nya terus macam apa yang kau sweet sangat siak
like macam
tak tahu ah handphone tengah record kalau tak aku dah buka Twitter aku dah tunjuk all the things that
oh that ada this girl ah there's this girl who ni mata air aku bilang there's this girl dia pakai tudung abeh dia nya boyfriend ada angkong semua
like macam tu so sweet macam she accepted him macam okay then after that like macam orang dia kata orang kat Twitter cakap gitu
terus macam err okay
ya then after that like macam
err err apa nama dia
then the boyfriend keep on kissing dia punya cheeks kind of thing then macam err then recently ah the boyfriend go and message her the way he message her saying that
um singaporean bi I don't need sex ah I can wait I can live without sex
terus aku nak kata lah if he's not fucking you he's fucking with someone else lah
then macam
apa yang macam merepek ah like that's the thing tau macam bila aku dapat tahu pasal romanticism kan
ikut perasaan tau perangai macam lembik perangai macam kental ikut just to like macam
like macam
ah I don't know how to explain ah nak kena tengok Twitter ah then after that aku can
really ah aku tunjuk aku can actually come to senses ah like tunjuk kau macam aku ambil
kita punya kedai handphone ada Twitter
banyak ah jap eh
eh takde eh
takde Twitter ah
camne eh nak explain
oo best ah kau kena tengok ah eileen the burton
eileen the burton ah eh for example ah the things yang dia highlight
yang benda yang dia highlight is like especially macam perempuan do this padahal kita pun buat laki pun buat like macam kita padahal kita buat not only with kita partners dengan members pun sama tau like macam kau tak tahu pe aku satu minggu penat macam for example dan it can be as simple as dan
this week aku penat gila ah kalau tak boleh turun boleh that kind of thing tau but we expect him to understand that eh kau dah bodoh pe
aku hari-hari kerja kau masih nak lepak sini ah that kind of thing ah it's like it's as easy as bro uh this week I quite full lah cannot come to the shop or not that kind of thing
ah this kind of thing ah so dia kata if it's a true love or if it's true friendship if you understand each other without saying which doesn't makes sense ah
abeh dia kata like macam we expect to do that we expect
macam for example dia cerita kan ah from a real life punya experiences dia balik
dia balik then after that err anak dia anak dia baby dia give anak dia some food anak dia tepis toddler ah nangis terus
kalau bini dia dah sepak ah I mean dia kata aku dah bingit gila ah dengan bini aku but he's my son lah but what I did was I try to understand him
like macam why did he why did he behave this way dia nak berak ke pampers dia ini ke dia gigi nak grow ke gini gini ah that's why then after that that was thinking ah dia kata dia macam why can't I behave
ah like macam senang cakap bila kalau
benda gini we always talk about girls kan macam eh what's wrong nothing that kind of thing like you can just tell me
but that's the thing ah like but at the end of the day also most guys also dorang tak tahu how to talk about
emotions macam suami kan
macam if they feel something diam
dengan dan pun diam unless kita brought it up really force him to talk about it then he will talk about it
a'ah tu pasal ah dorang tak ada orang ajar I mean like they
in a way lelaki kan
that's why dorang macam ah tak kesah pasal for example kalau laki laki ah siapa-siapa nak keluar kan
kita punya anak sedara ke siapa pe bapa pun macam nak pergi mana keluar take care eh jangan naughty naughty eh perempuan nak keluar kita kongkong that kind of thing lah like macam
laki we are just left to be everybody understand everybody have a way of thinking that guys are they can make it out there ah quite expected to know everything or like kau should know find for the answers
kita is still need a manual pe in some ways cuma that differentiate people lah like how they actually view things ah like some people they will macam
tak tahu continue to be lost lost lost lost lost lost sampai ke mampus anak bini semua masih lost ada kalau people have gone through a lot of shit kan then after that macam eh things cannot happen like this ah I want to find something better baru dorang improve
macam that time yang client aku hugo tu whoa
sama ah like macam abeh nampak dia tengah going undergoing stress tau a lot pasal bini dia kat portugal and dekat sini semua
abeh berbual dengan dia berbual berbual habis terus aku just open up ah aku just ah butoh lah aku cakap pasal bapa aku semua kan
aku cakap err apa nama dia
oh like macam that time bapa aku gaduh kat kerja tak ada orang defend dia that kind of thing then macam see everybody expects guys to like
macam siapa lelaki ada siapa nak berbual takde siapa-siapa pe
dan dah macam
okay ah we have no one macam you know then my friend ah kata ah aku tengah stress kawan aku kata
you know I'm not the up for the psychiatrist thing dia kata
laki ah laki you you don't know how to open up pe
a'ah it's seram
macam that time aku dengar satu talk tu ex-feminist kan aku dah cakap kan dia buat documentary dia feminist
and dia buat documentary ironically pasal err apa nama dia dia buat documentary about macam opposite of feminist ah kira men ah men fighting for men's right dia interview ni semua biasa tapi asal dia kerja
dia shut off that side of dia punya feminist side ah so kepala otak dia semua dia just judge whatever comes up to their mouth kan dia just judge
then bila
it comes to editing she have to listen what to everything so dia dia have to edit out filter all the content so dia realise never once
the guys were talking about ah apa nama dia

blame kau yang anuh mm that guy from another room blame kau yang anuh but then this guy another room they keep blaming each other but no one blames themselves ya so dorang make it like a story by dorang dia punya problem
end up macam kecoh ah now dorang dah tua sia sekarang
rabak sia tu
actually donald trump ah who ah that time kata donald trump banyak
keluarkan wrongly ah wrongly reason black people out
orang buat people will do things but then if in matter of the in the in the matter of kau tahu ke tidak is siapa yang sampaikan media apa that's why media is they say
sometimes aku ada fikir balik whether trump is really racist atau tak
kau tengok eh
before trump was a president fifty cents semua rapper semua suka fifty cents ni semua suka trump sia
aku grow up hip-hop pe trump memang
respected ah tu fifty cents kata eh dia jadi president semua orang benci dia
pasal dia pandai dia businessman apa
first punya election cause whatever you see on the media is just a for example forty per cent of americans the most americans semua like next ni semua dekat kampung-kampung so when you go to kampung-kampung I want to make
america great again orang semua suka kau ah ah so you get the majority votes
aku lupa ah
pastu dia dia pada aku kan
at the end of the day kalau kau dah enam puluh tahun kan life kau memang macam atuk nenek kita pun dorang cakap benda annoying pe that's one thing second thing kan this guy
new york kalau kau boleh hidup dengan mafia you can work with mafia to create trump tower when the workers who built that tower is mafia nya macam mafia control them but ni kau dah bagus mafia control everything new york
apa nama dia concrete bricks ni semua semua dia control
abeh kalau kau boleh survive that makna kau bukan bodoh sia
tu ah macam cakap world is being too soft ah
like macam that's the thing pasal aku macam aku nya aku selalu step macam jahat
jadi terlalu baik cause I have to acknowledge the devil the shadow kalau you err psychologist ah dia cakap kau nak kena face your demons kau kena acknowledge kau punya demons
so all these closet perverts ah be that all these closet perverts ah dia macam
um macam macam kau semua kita cakap pe kita open kita gini gini gini punya orang kita tak bedek kita tak macam
tak ah aku baik baik baik padahal musibat
ni kalau kau bersih pun maknanya kau hidup macam kermit ah hermit
pasal it's not human pasal apa-apa yang ada dekat kita itu semua part of feelings
pada aku is wrong to apa
feel a certain way but it only jadi wrong when you act upon it
kalau kau act upon it means kau dah conclude the whole
macam salah a'ah macam siapa nama dia
ah dalam islam umar
umar paling fierce placebo
no matter is considered allah
umar umar bila orang kata rasulullah meninggal kan
dia kata pe satu kali korang cakap kat aku rasulullah meninggal aku pancung korangnya kepala
abeh terus err apa nama dia
it's the other aku pernah dengar this talk orang ni cakap ustaz dia aku ni pemarah gini gini macam
bermakna it's not wrong we have to chill lah paling sekarang siapa next ah apa err the third khalifah a khalifah is someone paling garang sekali pe
macam you got to chill lah it's what you do you do
tu aku tak suka orang cakap ee kau ni
err cepat marah seh cepat marah I mean like pada aku cepat marah is a bit people who are very attune with their emotions
macam people want entah lah orang just
sebab tu lain orang lain pe
macam aku dengan mata air aku selalu macam aku cakap raised punya voice kan I'm not angry I'm just I mean I mean I'm I'm not angry at you I'm just I'm trying to acknowledge my feelings but when I raise my voice macam kadang aku tak marah dia it's just macam kita berbual pasal something ah we get hype up macam I'm not angry at you I'm just ah accepting the fact that I am angry about this
at least aku tak terbawa-bawa ah at least aku tak like macam
err apa nama dia
step ah step baik tak acknowledge ah I'm fine I'm fine
butoh I'm fine
kau hide it under the rug wonder the rug will be big enough sia kau dah tak tahu mana nak buang kau punya angry
dah berapa lama ah
tiga puluh tiga puluh thirty three
okay ah this is about korean show ah eh korang jangan judge aku
this one korean show aku tengok pun sama pasal apparently this one kid
macam dia nya life just
memang fucked up ah memang rabak ah but then she work inside this company whereby dia banyak tolong orang ah but then at the same time
sampaikan orang tap
into other people's phone untuk dengar conversation semua
terus friendly orang yang this guy another guy in dia nya company kira orang dia baik gila ah macam bukan nak cakap baik gila but then he's
entah macam very straight ah with dia nya principles dia kira cakap sometimes certain things kau shouldn't kalau kau dengar
kau shouldn't say
certain things kau dengar kau just keep it to yourself pasal kalau kau benda benda macam gini eh kau boleh disrupt orangnya friendship even though macam aku dengan kau gini kan aku dengan kau macam okay depan korang aku baik
belakang korang aku might be talking shit but sometimes that is the kind of thing that sometimes people just want to express dorangnya feelings it's not meant for the other person to hear ya
so dia cakap I know you're working but kau kena fikir balik apa kau buat pasal this kind of things it will disrupt orangnya life
that's why macam pada aku orang yang macam step baik kan whenever someone said something bad they will assume oh dia ni jahat
pasal kau tak pernah acknowledge anger you don't understand anger
macam aku just nak cakap jer ah aku not satisfied with this what's wrong with that
sebab tu that time aku sangkut sia cakap ni apa ah ah nama cerita dia is my minister
bagus sia
it's not about a okay ah very like ten per cent about love like the most is about dia punya how fucked up the whole situation is ah
pada aku semua cerita best ah korea ke apa ke
that's why aku quite shocked sekarang macam aku quite interested to macam tengok like korean shows
pasal dorang kan kalau kau tengok balik korean they are very well attune to dorangnya feelings
tu pasal aku suka tengok cerita lucifer
oh asal pasal yang macam dia acknowledge whatever feelings pasal he's not human mm he's not human abeh dia jumpa psycho ah psychopath pula dia jumpa psychiatrist dia and dia talk about feelings oh ya
and like macam the way dia take it like macam oh aku feeling this way eh is it ah that kind of thing ah so macam interesting
wah then dalam one of dia nya show dorang aku dengar this this guy cakap
macam dia tak tahu tak tahu apa dia nak tak tahu apa what's going on around the world dia buat hal dia macam gini sakit hati kau mampus ah macam gitu ah dia clueless about everything around
sun tzu cakap dekat art of war
I mean if you look at life as a war kan macam everyday is a constant battle ah
you can battle with a lot of things ah dia kata
kau kena tahu diri kau kau dah tahu the people around you ah
whatever everything kau pada aku aku boleh relate ni benda ah and then like
macam walaupun bila orang tu buku ni dia tulis untuk war pe but then you can look at it into business in life
macam battle ah for example
sekarang eh
the battle is for me to win korangnya hearts boleh cakap gitu pe
abeh macam I trying to win a friendship I want to get this kinship between us that's a battle also pe so kau nak kena tahu diri kau kau kena tahu kau punya people apa kau suka pasal apa kau suka apa apa kau tak suka and then from there aku boleh win the battle lah
aku pernah sia that time tengok after that watching dia nya like the series kan aku balik rumah aku just hate everyone
that's walking around aku sia aku macam like fuck sia korang like
aku macam aku tengok semua orang macam korang like do you guys see all these things that's banyak orang tak nampak
ah macam sial lah tak ah macam like these kinds of things that happened in the dark ah macam usually orang nampak semua macam let's say
a'ah from apa orang tunjuk jer pe
pasal sometimes no matter how bad the person is also kan kau nak kena tahu like what make him that way
tapi pada aku macam no matter how bad the person pada dia dia dia betul ah ya lah that's why like macam ada orang kata like
someone else's war is someone else's peace something like that lah dia punya line
it's like pada aku like macam wow it's like kalau kau nak kahwin
kau nak anak kau islam kau tak boleh kahwin dengan orang christian pe mm pasal pada dia minum no problem whatever dia believe in is different than yours
so to them after that korang gaduh then tak boleh cakap salah siapa pasal korang believe in different things
ya lah means like dia macam
that time adik aku pernah cakap ah dia bilang aku cakap kalau let's say eh the relationship korang gaduh in a relationship kan korang gaduh make sure korang berbual with each other face to face mm then gaduh quarrel with inside
ah that's not me ah yes kalau kau nak quarrel dengan aku kau quarrel dengan aku aku sendiri
macam that time aku text mata air aku dia kata apa
kau mesti ingat eh kalau aku tumbuk sesiapa sekarang kan okay let's say aku tumbuk kau kan if you get punched the only pain yang aku with the puncher is accountable for is when dia punya fist hit kau punya muka other than that kan tu semua self-inflicting pain
ni macam yang johnny depp member amber heard ah
oh dia tu lagi satu sia kesian sia
berbual kan a'ah aku ada dengar sikit juga
johnny depp tengah kecewa
ah terus end up jadi pukul pula
in a way dia punya suara like they just dia bukan marah tau dia just disappointed with what she turns to ah
like sebelum tu aku nampak kau macam wah like she's that perfect girl then suddenly
once that's why macam
ah tu pasal ah
macam apa romanticism dia cakap like macam one thing dia tak suka pasal romanticism ah is
first love macam
kau tengok jer kau dah tahu tu dia punya kau punya love one he questions the one kau tengok kau belum kenal that person tau
macam everything is based on feelings
abeh dia kata the only normal person eh
semua orang semua tak normal actually semua orang messed up
kau tak tahu dia punya problem tu pasal dia kata like macam
it's best to have a communication ah like macam bila kau jumpa orang kan I rather don't believe in like oh dia ni cantik ah kalau kau rasa dia cantik maknanya kau suka dia physically then after that kau get to know that person ah
then slowly like macam
ah then work things out from there ah you have to know like macam oh
does dia love aku macam
cause some people dalam dia some people
pasal when it comes to love kan cause suffering also come to place juga
dia dia dorang ada ratio dia
banyak orang kita can vibe with
best sia romanticism nya talk pasal I mean
even though aku suka dengar pasal tu kan it's not that aku tak romantic as well at all tau
like macam eh I cannot behave this way towards my girlfriend cause it will make her have this romantic mindset which would actually damage the relationship in the future
err ya like macam gitu ah expectations ah like macam a lot of the things ah like macam merepek ah tak masuk akal ah
aku need kau ada Twitter tak lis
tak pakai ah tapi ada dekat handphone kau
pasal aku nak kena tengok some examples ah
eh actually aku boleh ah tengok pakai ni aku boleh record sambil ni takpe aku tengok Twitter dari aku punya ni
handphone then aku aku highlight some of the romantic romanticism punya ah ni
vulnerable lah like macam kau takut nak jadi vulnerable
a'ah kau tak nak
oh azmi ah azmi cakap apa
si azmi pun
dia kes dia punya orang pun dia apa tau dia kata macam dulu dia macam kita macam baru kenal dia kata diam dulu relax
but then what make him change was he went travelling then like macam only on the third day baru dia berbual dengan orang terus macam dia punya last day kan ataupun orang tu last day
terus macam eh sial ah gerek gila sia
when I can talk to you in the first day and then we have a great time together sejak dari situ dia just macam open jer ah dengan semua orang dia boleh berbual ada selamba jer dia berbual jer ah
you cannot force the process ah macam kalau dia cakap gitu aku pun takleh expect anyone to oh betul eh aku try gitu cannot cause you have not gone through that process
you never truly understand it ah so if you skip the process memang
plus kita busy with a lot of things
err apa nama dia ah to throw away ah
and like really ni satu annoying perempuan pergi screenshot mata air dia gi send
tak this is all the stuff that aku scroll aku nampak ah
perempuan love this kind of shit pe
panjang gila mampus eh macam si dia tu highlight ah
err apa nama dia dia kata romantic romanticism can only be practised pada orang yang tak kerja orang yang tak ada goals in life
macam you want that macam that is not healthy sia
macam hundred of hundred per cent of your time or ninety per cent eighty per cent is being
err spend on someone tau dia macam just talk shit just make yourself feel better I love you you love beautiful that kind of thing kau spend pages tu semua
kau tahu macam you can spend time writing this tapi kau tak boleh write benda-benda yang lagi berfaedah
like macam
ah like macam god meant to take someone macam sial ah
ni cantik cantik tell him queen
macam ah
hais sial laki ni ha padahal aku belum tengok dia kata laki ni sial I mean like oh okay so you have to lie now
dan ah macam dulu dan macam oh thanks bro macam whoa best pe dan ada dekat sini
sekarang apa-apa dan buat nanti syahmi will find a reason to hate on it
pada aku ni macam a little bit romanticism in a way
I mean like macam
to to a certain extent okay lah there are some guys who just like openly like ni semua macam that's the thing like macam
aku tahu sia macam from experience I know girls
who secretly wants some guys sial lah living okay tak payah pergi jauh adam sendiri siak berapa banyak attached women go to him
the fuck is that abeh kau nak come to aku like macam kau nak pure gila nak mampus
macam no I only think of you macam
kau jangan bedek ah kita manusia ah sial
dia kata one of the things that
sex and marriage sex and love intertwine so dia kata apa tau
when you kira
and then err apa nama dia err
so they intertwine sex dengan love so if someone can treat you like good
bagus gila nak mampus tau
sweet tapi dia tak boleh fuck you well ah
kau terus down
kau macam oh this is not true love
or in a way ah tu pasal how I see it ah like most girls kan bila dia dah give themselves too easy to a guy
yang apa nama dia ini ah dia kata like macam so aku macam try to understand tau
kadang mata air aku ada sikit annoying ah which is aku understand pada aku like macam
dia believe in romanticism ah
before dia know aku pe so like err
I mean like it's a like confirm confirm tak boleh tau
and like macam kalau kau buat maknanya dah end of the story that kind of thing
it's not that aku nak main orang lain or what ah
but it's just that when you place that kan so slowly kau subconsciously
kau punya mind will go lower and lower in a sense that
err kalau apa nama dia that mind macam so kalau kau like orang lain kan sexually dah kira salah kalau kau have fun kalau that time dia ada issue with aku keluar kawan aku perempuan aku dah kenal dari dulu dah lama gila
terus dia tengok story macam eh you look you seem more happier with her tu aku dah kenal dia berapa lama macam aku aku happy pun salah ke
that kind of thing like macam so they will like if someone can replace can if someone can give him happiness
maknanya that person is for him then macam happiness comes in different form
so kau jangan think it the way just cause gini abeh kau down
abeh like macam oh dia dah tak suka aku like this
takleh keluar tak ada kawan tu semua that's what overthinking is a more commonly err
ya happen in that situation ah so macam all these toxic punya
toxic punya pemikiran ah
and like macam
pada aku most of the time kita tak gaduh it's just that disagreement jer ah like macam we talk about something disagree macam dan dengan ni
ah dan dengan mel
tapi tak sampai kita merajuk it's just that aku disagree atau certain things like macam dia kata I cannot sleep ah terus macam asal oh I
don't overthink kau bilang aku jer asal let me talk to you lah like macam
ease your mind sikit ah apa aku boleh buat dia cakap tak nak nanti menyusahkan kau
abeh terus nanti kalau dah bilang then after that dia come to conclusion that dia overthinking abeh dia ingat macam
oh aku selalu buat orang susah lah aku selalu macam kita kena gaduh pada aku ni tak gaduh
ini bukan gaduh it's just us communicating jer
can you stop pasal that's the thing
macam all these romanticism kan benda-benda gini fikir gaduh
pada dia kan love is love hundred per cent all the time having fun
that is like the the extreme err apa view of romanticism ah we have three more minutes my friend
dah terlalu banyak benda personal if you're listening to this
tadi korang cakap berbual pasal happiness pun macam
it's just like macam how orang europe confirm pergi holiday dekat bali
dia kata ee
like macam
pada kau mesti ah pasal kau punya standard lain apa dia punya standard lain
macam dulu aku bilang aku pernah bilang korang tak aku berbual dengan razi then razi tanya aku
where do I see myself in ten years dia tanya aku
dia cakap aku cakap tu ni tu ni ah then cakap aku kan semalam dia datang aku berbual dengan dia terus cakap razi kau ingat tak yang kau bilang aku ni

kawan kak yin siapa sia
nadia punya is that one meh

oh very dia lah very dengan kind macam gini eh
yes dia pun macam macam rumi juga a bit lah
it's just the pelik for me
I don't know ah dia macam
I think dia dah gonna get
engaged eh ke kahwin tak tahu lah cause dia I don't know aku selalu nampak dia on Instagram dengan this one indo girl
in the video I think I got hear before dia berbual indo macam indo punya kind
so that time dia dengan dorothy together
and then dia punya Instagram is still dia dengan perempuan tu
I don't know eh but dorothy punya Instagram is different dorothy dengan dia
so I don't know ah apa
what kind of three way ke apa binatang it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird pelik also
then that time yang aku pergi tengok thai punya performance kat monti
then kita invite rumi also lah cause rumi cakap dia nak tengok like um drag performance those nya kind
and then banyak-banyak then
tertiba dia macam tak ada girlfriend
dia dia cakap dia single cause
know thai punya friends those gay friends keep asking ah like apa tu oh ah where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what dorang macam nak menggatal kan then macam like
oh no lah I'm single and some more dia tengah in ke apa
but then dia punya Instagram masih ada the indo girl tu
and then just damn pelik ah sia and he host around with anything that moves
aku pun tak tahu aku just don't know lah
but I know zul tak comfortable dengan rumi also
zul pun petty nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap like I don't want to talk to rumi cause he never wish me happy birthday
macam apa kau merepek eh
ya apparently then aku macam
girl kalau aku lupa nak wish kau macam mana eh how ah and was like I probably won't talk to you ah
I tak faham
aku just tak faham I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday dia macam like dia cakap birthday is important what it's once a year what so hard
then aku cakap like if you're not
ah aku tak faham ah
but zul know I know zul um tak comfortable cause of tu ah
um rumi I think rumi macam menggatal dengan dia also
unfortunately for his case lah but I think that time zul was with dylan dengan mata air dia ah
ya and then dia cakap like rumi eh rumi uncomfortable and then macam
kalau I know we are all closed kita very touchy also cause we hug a lot ni semua then
dia cakap rumi rumi does that ah but rumi macam
it's kau
macam gitu jer ah
but rumi I've always seen as that way cause first time aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu
kita semua minum pe together at sticky fingers
but I like to see dia punya Instagram cause dia selalu pergi merayap makan and he eats good food
kat tempat the weirdest place
ya and dia ada motor I think
I think dia ada motor vespa
vespa dia macam ada shield macam that big ass shield kat depan
dia very gitu lah macam indie macam dia nak stand out from the rest
dia macam dia kind of mainstream but dia tak nak show yang dia mainstream so he gets something that is
macam kawan kau ni ah also macam motor tak banyak but actually people want that kind of bike
ya dia macam gitu jer
maybe ah the dorang just what one year apart kan
dorang sama batch pe so ya
cause dorang cousin
ya hor then that one yang mana muka dorang pun tak sama sangat
case dorang pakai baju
senonoh gitu ah quite presentable
but aku just stress ah
aku just stress tengok dorang
I think dorang tu lah
I think rumi ambil
culinary but I don't know if it's ke tak I think he went to SHATEC or some
cooking school cause aku nampak dia selalu masak jer
uh I don't think rumi take aku dulu ingat dia gemuk dia pernah tunjuk gambar dia
dia tunjuk gambar dia grow up ah that that night at sticky fingers ah dia macam like eh you all want to see or not I last time look like what gemuk gila gemuk gila macam bola sia muka dia
I think masih ada kat dia nya Instagram dia post
probably eh cannot be dia baru enlist baru juga enlist
kau tahu yang dia kambing boy kan
kau tahu advertisement yang kambing
no like I think Suria ada this advertisement where
anak kambing saya and then dorang pergi macam this farm abeh ada advertisement kambing lari-lari rumi was
rumi was that boy in the in the kambing video that's why when aku jumpa dia kan at times like eh
kau macam familiar then tahir first time aku dah tahu dulu cause dia cakap dia in that kambing video and then when I brought tahir out to meet justin zul rumi semua and then macam like
and then keep keep keep guessing then thought he really is the kambing boy but dia tak pernah post ah
tak pernah post at all kau tengok gemuk weh
then dulu dia masih gemuk sikit
he doesn't like pout or whatever shit oh dia ambil gambar nanti boleh nampak macam kalau aku nak ambil selfie atau aku ambil group photo nanti tiba-tiba macam like dia adjust adjust dulu angle dia baru dia stare through camera gitu
oh there kawan-kawan dia
I don't know many picture ambil budak whampoa ah sia
if I'm not wrong dia bukan melayu
but dia berbual melayu ah I think
dia ada malay blood but I don't think it's like full
it's smaller and smaller lagi-lagi kalau kau masuk kan tertiba semua orang kau kenal
macam aku ah aku before aku satu orang pun tak kenal sia aku cuma tahu aku punya secondary school friends and friends
then masuk you will be like eh kau kenal ni kau kenal tu oh aku dari dulu sekolah tu
kau masuk aku rasa kau will meet
cause kau ninety nine
so yang kau meet also is those like long route punya sekolah
lagi lama lah sia
poly itself is already three years kalau kau remote remote
no choice I think last boleh ambil kau twenty six twenty seven
twenty aku masuk twenty fourteen twenty fourteen
twenty fourteen atau twenty thirteen ya
then ada satu budak ni from nineteen ninety
so it's like what twenty four gitu and he's one of the oldest
aku rasa kau kau masuk nanti kau tua sia kau masuk next year kan
eh kau graduate is what month

should be masuk may atau june aku june intake what
girl aku that time tak ada choice
aku two weeks jer aku dapat surat tu aku dah kena masuk kena campak ah sia
aku nya applications for private schools jer dah rejected say oh we cannot accept you cause your letter is too soon and then cannot cannot apa tu reject aku nya school applications cause
it doesn't makes sense but aku aku tak faham but aku masuk anyway
if aku defer I have a feeling I would go into army
for sure cause abang aku not in recruit anymore what
that time I wanted to lah I die want to cause aku nak main combat combat nak main tembak-tembak semua cause
tak ada orang dapat main tembak apa unless you're in police lah but police punya
weapons weaponry and shit is different is more to apa tu defence atau macam whatever protection lah
duit aku sia
is it the one kat tempat yang yang
dekat dengan some centre thingy where all secondary school last time kena pergi kan
itu yang indoor kan
ya but yang outdoor pun ada pe budak-budak pergi
last time is the same venue just that ada macam this tempat lapang ni
padang or some some plain field lah I don't know I not I not
we'll see lah we'll see kalau kau masuk army ke tak okay
petition for apa eh
of course lah dia nak standardise dia nya family
no cause that time I did remember I had a talk with your mum kat tempat the car wash kat then macam like
oh baba lele is then macam aku and then pop is police then aku macam like okay what kalau adik masuk at least dia belajar real life skills kalau tak masuk paramedic pun at least ada firefighter cause ada dua jer pe yang
hot spot nya vocation then macam like tak nak ah mama nak dia masuk army that's it
sister aku dah macam gitu macam okay but ya lah I mean
for sure kau better off in
army lah cause kau dulu pe
aku rasa mama kau die die tak nak kau masuk police lah or just cause dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya son go through the
ah boys punya experience
ah brotherhood dia dia cakap yang oh tak ada brotherhood
macam what where my sisterhood
ada tu ada lah tapi macam you know nanti korang dah pergi station terus kau pecah like go scattered elsewhere
but ya kau masuk army sua
kau have one job okay kau jangan disappoint your mum
technically budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada choice pe apa benda before enlistment you can apa tu fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause dorang cakap banyak orang depression cakap yang dorang kena campak to different organisation and then dorang suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill punya shit
especially banyak orang complain sia aku tak faham aku that day pergi balik to my academy aku tengok
barang-barang kau semua dah siap sia atas katil
it's not like macam dorang bagi kau an empty bag then like my time I
bag bag besar tu then kena pergi two different store rooms cause aku kecil gila so aku kena cari aku punya size know campak kena ambil dorang dorang campak helmet
helmet dorang campak bottle dorang campak jer eh macam like
macam kau tahu aku tak tahu aku rasa dorang were paid to be that much of a an asshole
so dorang macam kat table dorang kan dorang macam like S size S size then budak-budak store dia macam like keluar kan barang abeh macam like campak campak kat pile lah so that pile is all S size another pile is so
kalau aku nak aku ambil from that pile yang dorang campak campak tu ah so aku just ambil jer

aku patah balik bunk kau tahu kita kena
apa tu apa dia cakap fall in eh
fall in kat tempat kita punya coy apa benda tu and then kita alpha so alpha tingkat dua jer tak payah nak naik like five six storeys but alpha alpha and bravo
um kita nya bunk is
single bed is not like double deck so I think charlie and delta delta paling worst ah obese kan so delta is the last floor plus dorang bunk bed ya so the entire macam kau tahu the spiral stairs
it's not an open stairs dia macam ada window ah but tutup so kadang-kadang bila dorang dah habis training dorang nak naik kan nanti dia punya tingkap all like foggy
cause dorang punya body sweat and heat kan naik atas and especially dorang kena sampai tingkat enam ke lima girl aku tengok dorang you know bau lah cause they have cause we have to share the stairs ada tiga so
so pandai pandai korang lah scatter kan but I don't know why dorang suka naik kat tangga where it's always alpha yang kena pakai alpha pakai cause alpha tingkat dua jer and then dorang naik itu
but anyway bila aku nampak aku kan nak tidur kan dorang macam kena brief debrief eh kau punya before kau boleh tidur kau kena drink up drink up aku is like
ya I think the bottle besar lah sia
I don't know how many ah I think one litre atau five hundred cannot be five hundred this is not much this is five hundred
so it's one litre ah tu so one litre kau tahu aku dah gini gini means half kan
so aku manage to drink half then aku tak boleh minum then aku
dorang tak boleh cheat what cause nanti at the end of the tu siapa dah habis kena gitu
tak boleh kena ada drip lah kat lantai tak boleh macam
tak boleh weh first day kita belum tukar into our uniform what it's civilian clothes
so basah then aku dah habis kan
kau tahu first day aku pegang bottle aku weak gila ah sia kan

member tendang ah sia botol aku gi kat longkang then aku macam
aku first first tengok dia like

so aku just tak tahu ah sia apa dorang buat
don't know most of them complain cause of homesick lah cause my time that time apa tu ada budak ni
and yet he bila book in kan dia selalu AWOL
bila dah jumpa dia the next week dia dah masuk kan nanti macam like oh dia cakap like oh my after all apparently dia punya family sick but then when the budak-budak provost the security pergi rumah dia

no saint patrick budak-budak thirsty kat situ budak-budak female thirsty not only female thirsty male thirsty also I can't
aku that time nak sia masuk saint
it's macam low-key prestigious for being an all guys slash all girls school cause sana dengan saint pe
a'ah merepek gila
but budak-budak saint is sampah
macam also
sampah sia dorang
ya but you're only limited to that time to jerit what
kau nak jerit kat orang buat apa eh
ya but why jerit during when can jerit everyday and not be in that also
dorang tu um scout me for
apa tu saint john
tak nak medical kan
buat apa ya
cause it's the biggest uh macam parade kan
cause I remember D&T block like really kecil and then in between the classes
no the centre one banyak pokok the the gardening the science block one is slightly bigger the space
situ jer korang merayau kat sana
but ya I I mean is the foot drill kan macam side side foot drill nya competition macam korang buat foot drill cause of footwork so korang buat the or whatever shit it is called is for precision
ee ada what what uniformed group ada eh
I know primary school ada scout
oh join kat luar
buang masa jer
east side tak ada eh
west coast ada cause that time I remember ada this budak book in
kau masih budak how can you
eighteen and I hold like like corporal how are you lieutenant then I realised aku zoom kan it's not civil defence
it's and then they go around macam
I think macam tu ah hannah nya ex siapa tu nama nya
siapa nama dia khai eh
ya and then dia dia nya mum
text hannah cakap like takmo jumpa anak dia selalu
tak cukup ke jumpa kat sekolah kau imagine kalau mak dia dah cakap gitu dekat faiz faiz would
kan terus ten K pun buang
merlin merlin semua camelot semua ada
wait but the one yang faiz bilang kan is the same night yang kita keluar
um cause when faiz bilang kan
oh wait my mum did say something about like faiz got something to tell the family I macam apa benda
how his mum gonna fork out ten K I mean you have to understand faiz is an only child habis tu dia nya parents also
work humbly lah like kerja enough for dia punya own small family he's not a richie boy a richie solo kid
and all his earnings are to his family and his his own allowances dia tak minta pun ibu dia duit that's for sure I know lah
so kalau dia minta a'ah minta aku two hundred
aku dah order apa dia cakap dia dah order tak ada duit nak bayar then aku macam
aku tak faham sia dia eh buat aku stress sia
lapar lah sia
kau imagine kalau aku abang aku dengan faiz are all girls mak aku minta ah confirm dorang tak nak kan bayar kan bodoh
oh ya yang tempat park avenue tu
not the melayu
I malay melayu
ah sia aku bagi dia eight eight jer lah
abang kau bagi fatin how much
but quite sepet mata dia weird eh was it dengan kau
ah dengan kau lah
kan aku keluar lift then aku cakap eh ni nak salam ke tak eh
then mak aku cakap itu kan bapa pengantin that's the one kan
oh ya ya he got the sepet eyes
damn kau ada kau ada new member
tiger dah accept
bodoh lah
apa sia tak ada duit nyayi
aku tak save pe duit
no I mean like there's a difference what between kau nya savings for your own self savings for
mm but he's holding the entire family punya
every month atau year annually got money lah store in so can take out once cause dia nak let go let go of all so that we all have our individual punya insurances investments and shit so he keep forcing me to be more independent so aku macam like apa ni I am still seventeen at heart but cannot lah
ya ya I think dia bilang
but we met what that time yang kat airport all all her sisters were there except for the youngest one
ya the yang kecil tak ada cause that time me and tahir didn't know that the youngest sister existed ya and then when dia tunjuk adik dia aku macam siapa ni this one my sister huh your older sister no this one my younger huh tahir pun macam like no cause we thought
all youngest cause tahir youngest aku youngest kau youngest so we thought she also youngest she don't give off the slightly older sister vibe
cause the mum tanya apa like ah this one can trust or not go overseas this one how old already twenty nine twenty three we are turning twenty two
cause we are what nineteen birthday kau dah lepas pe
ah kau nineteen lah twenty eighteen what
tahir nya birthday belum lagi apa so
september ya and then kita balik a few days later birthday dia
eleven cause that time you I got apa tu notified it's on my archive
it's too much already eh now banyak sia kawan aku dah post macam like
um much needed eh apa tu much misses holiday either bali lah patong beach lah all those
aku was there like
um there's a lot of animes I like to watch I I'm a anime fan lah so Netflix surprisingly dorang macam makin banyak anime dorang masuk-masukkan kan I was like wah quite quite amazed though sebab dulu Netflix there's not much anime
you still hype dia masih ada serious serious because right now um the movie just came out abeh macam
all all of us uh kita pergi tengok movie dia kan
there are some of our friends also dorang masih belum tengok
and also tak salah aku the season two pun belum keluar kalau kau belum
ah kau baru nak start the hype you still ah don't have to wait so long for the season two
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu season two possibly dorang akan keluar like
ya Netflix it came out ah slow but it came out came out right april tak salah april twenty twenty that's when the hype betul-betul naik ah sia and apa everytime
like uh there's some macam
apa eh I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that ah the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also err dia nya manga because normally mangas like macam for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach uh naruto
dorang punya like the amount of copies that they kan
berapa lama eh tak salah aku one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay lah this is just a rough gauge all of them ah took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
untuk demon slayer for the manga aje eh
dia wah it's only four years ah
dah hundred and twenty million dah
with drums ah ah tapi pasal kan tu ah japanese kan kita melayu kita kita kompang
masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya eh asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar eh
ya the like what they say ah apa actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how apa gui is ah as a person
ah tapi
dia nya other than the anime
um apa soundtrack dia kan
because one thing about uh anything in general ah kalau kau tengok a show or something kan
it is more emotional kalau dia nya soundtrack is a very macam it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer sekarang the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa yang the opening
and pasal
that it becomes like everyday object everyday ah actions are sampai they don't know ah they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but wah it's
for all the animes ah I watch semua ikut yang this dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang
macam aku rasa like one shot there's this thing called one shot animes dorang usually macam forty plus minutes abeh dah tu jer
dia macam a short a short film ah kirakan but it the sometimes like
orang fikir like oh the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters ah kadang-kadang even like those thirty or ten minute films kan it leaves a very
uh everlasting mark in your in your memory macam tak boleh lupakan it's that good ah like the story storytelling even uh the soundtrack cause come on man ah without soundtrack anything will be boring lah
it's okay man it's okay aku nya A math pun
bila entah eh macam there's this kind of stigma ah whenever you go to school or like university ah in that case
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh
ah I I shared this with my one of my friends ah dia pun tengah ambil university but I think is like I think ya so ya ah bro that one is just that's just one person lah don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
especially kalau kau buat coding atau math kan there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where macam oh wait what's going on I don't understand sia and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly atau atau secondary school tau
sebab mak aku english teacher
ya and also macam being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called err from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
like err apa tu there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is huh
macam apa sia dia ni like asal asal ah kecil hati exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like eh don't don't be so abrupt don't be so macam rude ah kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini kan the person who speak all those abrupt words or macam kasar kan dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam oh ni semua ah normal lah takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe] so I'll just continue with what I'm doing ah
adapting and also apa eh what's that word again uh you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
abeh kalau your
then kau akan dapat suspension
ah kau ah eh sorry
after one year then kau kena re-enroll
um when you are in a academic warning punya ni ah ya
if you haven't get academic warning then asalkan your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save lah
ada is that macam kau nya topic bukan topic apa module module is that module macam
kau nak kena belajar pasal another language
like macam malay atau mandarin
orh is it the same as macam
ada benda kita nak kena reverse the structure of a of a word
kalau english post office abeh melayu pejabat post dia dia dia macam reverse ah it's in that that way ah like buat orang macam confusing
pejabat post
oh like apa dialects ah slang slang
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the macam
ah baru-baru punya module yang apa nak nak kena ajar like aku rasa for example like
uh in the market I guess one thing yang
macam banyak-banyak tukar is the job finding
kalau let's say err user experience kan
normally macam tak banyak kerja pasal user experience mah because it's not that known to be uh to be like a proper job orang fikir macam alah ni orang lain buat boleh buat pe macam it's another job
on top of the job that orang tengah buat but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object macam kau pegang cawan
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right abeh kau imagine kalau they handle ada duri tak comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics err the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though macam it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
macam kau tengah bad mood abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa
like err happiness like for example kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja
abeh kau rasa macam eh how am I gonna get to that level so kau kau uh bertungkus-lumus kau uh cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak and that process buat kau bad mood
some people dorang dah so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset macam oh since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
like kau imagine ah like he said in two years eh
cam rezeki akan di diberikan like don't focus always on the rezeki focus on like
what make things work in in the last time ah macam retrospect ah but for now it's more like
which is why I appreciate like all those people yang even though it's just ah comic books or like anime kan it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
ah for this anime macam all these one
that's why like ah apa eh ya macam demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience lah the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
it's happening in in that macam ah alternate universe lah in a way ah ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is dorang they apa
dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam the movie walaupun that movie ada banyak orang macam superpower kan tapi dorang buatkan character tu macam he goes through everyday life as per normal but uh they somehow macam in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though ada orang dorang tak ada ah superpower tapi a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something yang buatkan kau macam strongly
uh huh game of thrones oh tak eh
tell you about it like macam eh macam orang gemuk like they want to achieve being slim like have that ah that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like eh dah kurus eh sia baik [pe] but actually kau kau tak tahu like the process itself buatkan kau nak slim kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam eh kau dah kurus kan
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal uh weight your optimal image tapi the
the thought of people macam dorang perasan like kau tengah berubah at least macam you looking more slim or looking more ah toned your body looks so toned then kau you'll feel better and it helps to
tapi it's it's I guess this little happiness macam kalau nak go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness buat kau macam maintain your course cause ada orang let's say pasal yang language one aku pun tengah another language is called C sharp programming language
for this different generations like sejak okay ah this past few hundred years ah there has been certain developments in uh certain parts of uh humanity like last time there's uh agriculture industrial evolution kan then there's uh
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam
aku nak keep up to date to certain things jadi macam I'm not
uh losing in the race for finding jobs atau uh skill sets so
aku push myself ah I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes kalau kau buat benda sorang like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
especially if you okay lah probably yang buatkan kau malu is kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam eh ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku assume that walaupun susah but aku I can just Google apa Google is there for me to help boleh search senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri
uh the the amid the Google search yang kau buat
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work kalau tak kan kalau kau ikut jer it will definitely not work
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun kan kalau kau buat game macam five dorang main ke I mean
ya like okay kalau aku ah nak aim for
apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar like tiga tahun empat tahun ah not not not not tak tahu belajar I mean tak tahu tak tahu buat math like aku bagi dorang game pasal math tapi ah dia nya macam quizzes aku bagi chemistry
lari kan that's why err that target audience is the most important thing when kau buat game macam untuk kau eh best sia game ni ada chemistry tapi kau tak tahu actually your audience is yang orang yang nak belajar pasal math
like iron man okay ni ni ni betul-betul uh off track
ah ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart lah like he might be one of the inspiration where aku will continue programming because
scenario kalau orang betul-betul don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so aku rasa like programming is a
apa eh
that's why aku really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
I mean they will have a controlled environment macam uh dia nya apa tu
apa tu ah udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam this sphere abeh kalau ada ikut macam earth punya udara inside that sphere aku rasa everything should be fine kalau orang kena tanam ke apa there might be a proper grave for them cuma
it's weird lah it it's weird ah cause tak pernah dengar orang ah eh mana kubur kau bukan kau ah mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa oh dekat mars ah aku nak merawat
naik spaceship but that is a possible future also like kalau let's say when elon musk dia cakap uh human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine kalau you have your own spaceship macam kereta sekarang but kau nya spaceship kau imagine macam eh aku nak pergi ah moon jap kau nak makan ah moon burger eh boleh ah kita gi makan sekarang K jap aku ambil spaceship aku
ya abeh kau ah fly ah okay ah ni set ah to moon then dia nya spaceship kau cakap okay uh ten minutes ride okay
abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang Grab pe so kau call uh space Grab
unless bila mars dah ada a way to like
maybe the thought of that like macam aku tahu aku tak mati so buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua you become complacent
then kau complacent then then there's no progress in life lah macam semua dah convenient untuk kau [pe] or aku boleh ah aku boleh tengok anime hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati pe so takyah belajar ah takyah belajar apa takyah mandi cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
makes humanity not to deserve to have a um apa eternal life
but not the things like macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam eh dia ni bagus sia okay dah tu jer ah abeh kalau macam for example kalau michael jackson
dia buat buat lagu semua macam okay lah kalau dia tak mati it's still there ah tapi bila he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because macam oh a legend it has it is a legend because
so imagine if like ah the apa eh
the same goes for ni ah the the the football legend
macam eh dia ada buat aku susah but
ya so okay lah takpe lah eh banyak time ah ni tak banyak time sorry
lagi apa eh
untuk err buka business yang
sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa canteen itu murah lah
ya lah tapi masalah dia
err yang
uh dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak
ya boleh masak lah tapi
and those kind of things lah macam nasi putih nasi
err jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu lah baru saya boleh buka
sebab because at schools they have err
so kita kena jual benda yang sama
canteen they they cakap they ada
business lain so dia
dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ lah because
so tapi
sekarang now we are
saya tahu lah apa itu kalau tak ada
ya mm maksud saya yang my first wish yang anak-anak jadi baik itu
bukan baik I mean it's baik overall lah it's good
ya so kalau
err tak ada lah tak ingat
with these variations I I I'm a bit like macam old fashioned lah
masa saya pergi india dulu
err ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik
like macam senapang tau
err tapi dia pergi macam
uh paddy field itu ada banyak burung
burung the one
err apa itu yang warna putih itu yang kaki dia panjang itu apa nama dia
so this pakcik
err will go then they they suka hunt these birds
then they bawa
they bawa then people with cook the meat
err but dia punya daging dia agak it's not soft like chicken tapi agak keras juga lah tapi I only remember I had that once
ya itu sahaja saya try
ya tapi sekarang masa itu saya kecil
sekarang now I'm grown up
bukan itu bukan maksud itu err macam jalan-jalan travel saya tak kisah I'm talking about food
food means all food I'm okay with all food except like macam
um saya boleh rasa macam okay just to taste lah once or twice but I will not make it like my daily consumption kind of thing tak ada
yes harap-harap corona ini over lah so we all can
okay let's say I I tengok satu jam atau dua jam
tapi saya saya err I'm
I sekarang saya suka yang not drag too much
story macam dia punya like short stories lah
macam yang err dia punya
kisah itu habis dalam masa let's say for one dalam one hour two hour tak drag drag drag sampai you know for few episodes ah macam itu saya tak ada patience nak tengok macam
ya it's short I mean apa itu orang cakap apa eh
ya macam itu semua saya suka lah
bila eh
oh twenty twenty three they keluar
macam like um I I also like all the superhero movies
no it's not that aku tak suka cuma I didn't err saya tak you know I didn't sit
the most I I think I watch will be spiderman lah yang banyak
yang saya tengok itu mungkin spiderman tak banyak sangat
bukan lah maybe that's what it's uh
so uh saya nak tanya eh
so you after your sekolah kan after your course you want to work where nak kerja dekat mana
yang itu hari err
yang sofian buat what internship itu it's research more to research right
so you pergi
kan sekarang cuti sekolah
tapi uh you mean
tapi yang you
err punya classmate yang dekat A level itu
ada ambil civil civil engineering
no bukan after A level ada your friends take the same course
so um sofian nak
if if you are considering higher education mana awak nak belajar singapore ke overseas
tak boleh lah mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini then go
ajar budak primary
itu lah saya nak like I said
nak buka business
kalau tak another option would be like macam work from home lah
mah do something like ecommerce ke
normal macam demam macam the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
err macam you know unexpected
err bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit
then memang orang itu dah stress because of the illness
ya so kalau dia tak ada duit
I wish lah if orang yang macam
so they get I think government ada juga lah bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi I wish they
ya itu maybe we can
tapi yang macam chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
itu satu err swimming sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar swimming
err dekat itu
err apa
ya sebab err coach itu boleh datang
mm dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ
I mean uh last time saya pernah ada juga pergi
tapi coach itu walaupun dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh lessons
tapi the coach is like uh not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own mm but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven tapi each lesson itu
ada dia punya itu lah result
so um berenang itu
because sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima
so sekarang
your you know like macam
ada pilates
satu jam is it a group class
dekat mana jurong
ya yang ini pilates saya bukan cari yang
yang pilates itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat itu
tapi ada lagi yang pakai equipments
active itu saya kena check kalau dia orang ada the same kind of pilates
kalau ada uh ya obviously I go for that
active belum
saya pernah pakai untuk swimming pool sahaja pernah
no yang saya cakap itu dulu
itu dekat redhill
so far lah because the coach um yang coach can only come there
ya like I said dulu punya coach itu
the coach uh tapi sekarang punya coach itu
at least ada lah ajar sikit-sikit but I know I would I will take with some
sekarang saya punya itu package remain one more lessons only
no bread toast is just I like lah but not mm not I eat something that I eat rest of my life tapi kalau macam
like macam
kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa eh
ah saya tak tahu lah awak
maggi mee
the nasi arab itu
ya smoke sebab smoke itu tak kuat smoke
then it will you know dia akan hilang cepat
itu bukan keras lah itu
ya tak tak tapi
pizza dekat mana
err you need a little bit of minyak sapi
err depends lah if you want to put it all minyak sapi or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
you boleh you boleh letak rempah-rempah dia like kayu manis buah pelaga is
bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak lah because it's only one cup of rice
then cengkih is clove
macam daun salam is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
err you letak garam
garam then when it when the
water starts to boil you letak itu beras
err nasi minyak you are talking about nasi minyak right
uh nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini
all water they will mix with half half like susu cair
half susu cair half water
no nasi lemak kita letak santan
this is nasi minyak
ya nasi minyak you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit lah
mm then you boleh letak daun pandan daun serai
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also macam you boleh letak tomato
you uh boleh letak chilli hijau semua lah then you put half half lah separuh
uh then the same method you put the uh garam
the other one the taste will be macam kenduri punya nasi lemak lah
ya that one is more like uh is uh more with it goes well with like macam ayam masak merah rendang semua
ya ini nasi minyak simple punya so it goes well with uh curry chicken
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can kau boleh masak dekat sekolah
you punya sekolah itu boleh pakai
you you boleh bawa itu uh
is like it acts like macam bila you nak masak soup with I mean like maggi
boleh nasi boleh lauk pun boleh you only need that one pot which call magic pot I don't know
boleh beli kalau you nak boleh beli yang
entah apa brand lah but I can recommend you few brands
tapi bulan december ini awak cuti kan
abeh are you going back
if you go exchange programme itu dia ambil masa berapa lama one year
audit uh start working oh because dia belum
so dia ada
uh is does dia ada plan untuk balik singapore ke tak
kau nak pergi ke tak
no lah go but you can try like kalau kalau kau suka
like you see the course kalau kau suka
ada lah yang itu yang dulu itu
dekat bilik spare
wait wait wait so he pinjam duit
ah dia put afan name down as macam guarantor kau tahu kind of thing ah
but did he tell him beforehand ke apa
so how long ago was this and berapa
dia punya amount
wait but kinda guy macam like can't he go to a licensed one
but you are initially macam kau okay with that ah actually
dia macam degil kind of guy ya
tak macam masalah dia it is that kind of thinking like
nanti your issues will like snowball
snowball anjing punya
pinjam duit shit
making macam
co-curricular activities kau tahu
but aku aku macam thinking more of on the lines of
macam you ask me to get a guard
macam eh eh eh bodoh you know that kind of thing
kau jangan get rile up ah
okay so the other day aku jumpa dia
oh it's one of those kind I like like like um on the video kadang-kadang
they would ah play macam
okay so dia cakap macam
kalau aku hilmi
then ah he wafan was saying ya but you know the act of macam more or less you're saying
I was wondering kalau
matair jer
so that's the thing I was trying to get across to him ah macam you know I understand where he's coming from sebab
help help that's a fucking understatement kan ya but macam
in a in a very tough spot aku macam put it in a more personal light ah I'm saying that I totally not okay
like would you still hang out with me tak
and then macam cakap
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then dia macam maki sekejap ah
abeh he said that he said that ultimate like pakcik thing to say that ah that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this one pakcik thing but he said the other part pakcik thing
nanti aku tak boleh focus
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay I I would still hang out with you aku masih boleh
lepak dengan kau ah kind of thing
aku macam okay
let's say kau nak main macam devil's advocate kind of thing
so what do you feel about the difference macam in terms of
okay but what do you think of her macam dia punya character and such
okay so I what I don't see where you're coming from ah macam aku faham but I don't think it's matter of gender tau
bodoh gila pe
sama sama situation as us ah
bulgy chonkers juga tau
dia punya their food
kan dorang punya makanan
the portion kan besar gila
tapi there's no incentive too you know
but that one also doesn't paint like err macam compete picture juga cause a lot of the citizens dorang punya baseline is met
okay uh as a brown guy here aku pun free education ah up to a point
we get sidetrack macam anjing
other factors juga
err apa nama dia
so what is it about the home wrecker yang
punya urge to choke slam dia is like rising ah it's
like the underlying issue is still there apa like he's basically not happy
it's a dengki thing ah
but if you see me tons of time aku mana iron anything
no but it's one of those things that it just macam it creeps up on you
sebab ah asian dengan
wait wait ah kau sixty one right
kind of situation aku macam I was eighty six kilo sia
aku used to have an issue about eating ah I don't why like I I was constantly lapar like hungry
but you eat you wake up in the morning kira kan macam
ravenous nak mampus
so macam um I think they were doing like is
macam no no no
aku dah macam yo
is it dah macam you know like
no it's not so much muz ah muz macam
so he was first I said okay but it was that kind of okay macam
suka hati ah you know that kind of thing
ah kind of ya so my sister was complaining a bit and then after that he was finding a a lot of issues pasal
aku pun nak join his side but I cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know I've I've um contemplated about lah some of them macam not a big deal but there are some things that he that as I find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is zakat
dia macam cakap oh it doesn't feel transparent
betul ah that's what fahim adhere
no not my family dinner at simpang kan
ah aku dah
aku dengar tu aku dah macam oo
roma dah stand at attention
so I kau jangan cakap gini ah
macam you cannot expect a marriage now what doesn't make sense right
just the show juga
oh he ajak me again like today's friday but aku macam
oh no no aku have
no it's one of those like coursera kind of shit kau tahu
this makes sense aku aku faham
australia eh tak
azam baru dengan veganism
mm mungkin dalam
tapi depend juga lah sebab tengok
err ada
ada have ada deteriorate ke
atau ada apa-apa yang mengubah persepsi dalam morality
depends lah you rasa macam mana
tapi macam ada standpoint morality
apa you punya
oh sebab tu rasa selfish ah
mm itu dia panggil cognitive dissonance err basically
bila you tengok
err dekat certain negara
you boleh tengok dekat YouTube
yang buat video dia tengah makan anjing macam yang video orang korea selalu buat dia kan makan makanan ah jadi kat situ kelakar tau sebab
kita boleh nampak dislike pada video orang yang makan anjing tu banyak tapi bila dia makan steak biasa
ah banyak jer like lepas tu korang comments semua yang elok-elok lah cakap sedap lah tapi bila yang anjing tu ramai yang dislike then bagi comment
yang marah lah marah sebab makan anjing tapi kat situ macam mana dia agak
mm sebenarnya tu memang argument yang orang selalu pakai
err tapi dekat situ timbul satu problem macam mana intelligence satu sentient being diukur macam mana dia orang measure
so dah jadi satu problem kat situ
kalau I sendiri ah rasa mm morally memang kita salah lah kalau nak ikut daripada standpoint moral
I suka juga tengok daripada satu
daripada satu uh
evolutionary standpoint yang mana
kita dah dah mutated dah evolved
sentient being lain though so dah in a way dah adapt sebab tu bila kita cuma nak tinggalkan
mm tradition bukan tradition tinggalkan diet tu dia bagi kesan sampingan pada badan lah sebab banyak juga
orang-orang yang ex-vegan yang dah
last sekali dia orang
dia orang tinggalkan juga veganism sebab
health semakin teruk kan
ah in fact baru five thousand years dari ya yang yang recorded lah five thousand years baru start ada
before that takde yang dikenal pasti lah
itu masa mesopotamia kan
tak I akan start dengan vegetarian dulu sebab macam biasa ah ni
ramai orang yang cakap benda yang sama dia tak boleh tinggalkan cheese
telur yes yes tak boleh
last kita makan beef pun bila
a'ah ah tapi okay lah kira itu tahun lepas punya cerita ini sekarang tahun baru
mm tapi kita kan pernah discuss sebelum ni kalau macam susah
kalau tak nak nampak poyo kita kena buat buat ada macam health issue macam ada allergy ke makan makan meat products
ada allergy jadi kita boleh pura-pura ada
ada illness ah ada penyakit yang tak boleh yang membuatkan kita tak boleh
oh ya lah rasa serba salah rasa guilty dia dah masak kan
I was many tak tahu pun
just just fikir bila dah tengok banyak
banyak debate
then dia macam dia start to make sense lah bila
discussion pasal morality issues
mm back then I consider juga standpoint yang lagi satu lah yang memang
kalau ikutkan daripada organism yang pertama pun memang dia
even plants pun evolve daripada organism yang
yang first
mostly pasal philosophy yang mana yang mana start
start into into betul pun lepas
and jadi banyak masa untuk
untuk reflect
untuk fikir err meaning of life
and then macam-macam lah err
argument macam-macam discussion dapat
dapat tengok sebab free sangat kan banyak free time masa pandemic ni
so daripada situ
dapat counter balik
dapat counter balik permikiran yang sebelum-sebelum ni
bincangkan pasal veganism
dia macam selalu irritating kan annoying macam mana ah
tapi err recently lah dah start macam okay nampak ah kenapa dia
dia make sense
mm ya lah source of protein tu senang nak dapat ya especially is buat tempeh lah
and boleh replace
kita sendiri pun makan sandwich yang hidang dengan tempeh
tapi still once in a while memang rasa craving untuk
err beef too especially bila bayangkan steak
um yang medium rare ah
kat situ lah jadi problem tu dia kita ni
bunuh other sentient being untuk bagi pleasure pada taste bud kita mm ada juga orang yang
yang counter balik dia cakap okay and then macam mana handling dengan nyamuk macam mana dengan err lipas
takkan kita tak boleh nak bunuh kan
err dekat situ itu persoalan yang lain
mm dia orang invasive macam lipas nyamuk ni invasive so dia bukan macam
err lembu lembu kita factory farm and then kita bagi dia life yang teruk just for the sake untuk dapatkan
product just for the sake untuk
ah ha sebab lembu tu dia tak pernah kacau orang pun dia tak ada ah masuk rumah and then hisap darah ke
tapi pun ada juga yang yang certain vegan yang memang sampai to the extremes dia orang tak bunuh nyamuk they just tiup jer a lot macam tu jadi ah yang tu extreme sangat kot
I mean kalau kalau kalau creature lain human ke animal ke
kalau dia start untuk invade tu kita ada right untuk ni lah self-defence lah
anjing ke kalau dia kejar ah kita boleh ah baling batu ke
dia tak nak right untuk
apa-apakan dia lah
macam nak belajar serious pasal philosophy
apa lagi ah
tak tahu you start dulu nanti I boleh tiru you
ya lah tak even even for me as a musician
mm mm dia tak tak strong rasa macam nak
nak improve bukan
ada lah rasa nak improve tapi nak sebab nak practise tu dia macam tak motivated sangat dia macam ada nak
nak cari benda lain mm mm I mean music tu kita punya
kita punya career tapi
dia dia stay macam tu lah then kita akan improve tu maybe while ah then while while working while performing
mm mm itu memang
memang best
mm mm tapi sia
almost apa memang lah
vaccine pun
february baru masuk malaysia kita pun tak tahu ya ke tak singapore dah
mm a'ah jadi pasal language ya I tengah focus juga dengan nak focus greek ah greek dulu lepas tu italian yang
yang senang-senang ah dulu
mm mm mm japanese tu dia considered as
uh dia orang pernah sort of difficulty kan then lepas tu
err hardest language to learn lah dia ada sekali dengan arab tapi yang tu dia measure dia ikut ni err
perspective orang orang yang
yang speak english ah mm tapi mungkin untuk kita asian
maybe japanese tak susah mana kot
ah dia among the easiest
a'ah latin juga sebenarnya latin mm
aduh susah lah tak pernah ada azam
dia benda-benda yang beyond beyond our control macam contohnya nak nak border dibuka semula
tapi tu lah dia kena ni benda tu beyond our control lah yang
yang in our control
tak tahu ah sebab rasa macam semua benda boleh dapat sekarang
desire tu macam tak tahu nak apa ah
ya lah memang
memang takde takde isu pun lah twenty twenty tu cuma travel restriction jer lah itu jer
walaupun restricted pun kita dapat juga daripada penang ke perak ke johor
december ya lah sebab kita dapat hanya
mm working from home lepas tu dengan dia sebab dia new experience kan kita buat voice voice acting gitu
benda yang kita tak pernah buat jadi ah okay ah
predict ah apa apa yang malaysia akan
tahun ni lah ah twenty twenty one yang dia ah
ah predict lah macam mana
mm but then again memang ramai lah yang buat online content cuma lama-lama tengok rasa macam
boring juga sebab
mm contoh
contoh macam music lah kalau yang lain okey-dokey kalau yang macam discussion debates semua okay lagi kalau yang music ni macam lama-lama jadi boring ah tengok online ah redundant lepas tu
lepas tu tengok bayangkan lah dah err you have to pay the ticket but
memang lah dia orang buat dekat
ah venue venue yang ada sound system yang best
tapi still benda tu dia depend juga macam mana dengan uh audio system
audience masing-masing ada pakai err earphone yang murah earphone handphone mahal ke apa ke so dia still quality dia
tak main peranan sangat lah
mm mm especially kalau memang dah semua orang dah dapat vaccine betul
eh mesti lah
mesti ah mesti kita akan buat event
takde ah
it can kelakar jer tapi takpe ah kalau orang tak nak
ambil vaccine kan dekat sini kan memang err kalau
err siapa yang nak ambil vaccine itu could
ni lah secara sukarela kan volunteer kan
so biar lah yang tu
mm mm siapa yang tak nak tu kita serahkan kepada yes
I rasa nanti kalau macam dia jadi back to normal dia akan ada ya lah dia akan
um celebrate sekejap dia akan macam wow ah finally dunia luar
mm tapi rasanya benda tu takkan dia punya excitement tu dia takkan tahan lama pun dia macam sekejap jer and then orang lupa balik sebab
err even masa
pandemic ni pun dengan dengan semua orang ada internet memang literally semua orang ada
daripada socialising ah so macam dia dia
not a big deals sangat pun pandemic ni cuma memang lah ah physically
mm memang tapi uh physically memang lah dia orang crave untuk jumpa depan-depan tapi sebab ada internet ni
dan tu lah sebab tu nanti excitement dia akan sekejap jer
oh tapi err
nanti bila bila dah normal balik maybe semua orang boleh jumpa secara fizikal tapi dengan dengan perspective yang baru lah ah maybe sebab dia dah banyak spend time sebelum ni dia dia walaupun dia banyak free time untuk
err walaupun smartphone memang ada kat dalam tangan sentiasa tapi dia orang banyak tengok
macam content content yang wasteful lah yang macam setakat tengok meme jer
tapi masa pandemic ni macam ramai pula yang
dia tiba subscribed to a skillshare ah ambil
ah kelas-kelas yang macam-macam kan so dia dah start gunakan free time dia betul-betul and then dia betul-betul masuk ke dalam dunia internet yang positif ah
so dia dapat banyak gila input
ada shift
yes and no biasa jer biasa jer yes tu sebab
sebab kita travel kan kita dapat pergi
mm pergi keluar kita dapat
and then mm masa kita masuk pandemic baru nak start pun kita memang baru balik kan
so benda-benda tu memang rindu lah benda-benda tu tapi
daripada tahun yang pandemic ni pun
not bad juga so dia macam dah biasa
mm boleh lah memang
memang naturally stoic kot
rumit lah kan ah tak lah in in a nutshell dia just pasal
pasal being remaining neutral lah dia macam
bukan pessimist dan bukan optimist ni in a in a nutshell lah mm dia punya actual definition dia tak pasti lah macam mana tapi in a nutshell yang I faham
remain tegak jer tau ah macam
kalau benda teruk jadi yang beyond kita punya control and then apa yang kita boleh buat ah just
and then bila
datang satu benda excitement pun
jangan jangan terlalu ah jangan telalu absorbed jangan terlalu soaked in dalam feeling yang
yang kuat tau sebab nanti dia akan ada
apa pendulum effect
mm dia akan bidas balik
nihilism tapi tak lah nihilism
boleh lah nihilism ni dia just
except yang kalau kalau kalau
kalau life ni takde meaning pun
takpe lah sebab ada orang dia macam strive untuk cari meaning dia
tapi what if
memang takde meaning apa-apa memang
datang dan pergi macam tu jer kan just play along jer lah
ah memang ah
mm kalau ni memang banyak refer pada nature ah tapi
mm okay sebenarnya dia dia bukannya
err bukan yang teruk sebab ada juga term optimistic nihilism
mm mm before that memang ada encounter tu tapi good place tu dia macam lagi explaining dia explaining lah
mm kalau kau tak tahu pun macam tak tahu pun benda ni dibincangkan cuma
sebelum ni kita experience kan kita macam
mm start ada turning point untuk
ah rasa macam dapat revelation in something
and then bila tengok memang ada
memang ada study pasal ni err seronok lah sebab dia explain kan
mm hmm hmm memang lah memang tak boleh shaft pun tapi boleh
boleh introduce lah introducing okay tapi bila shaft
shaving new opinion tu
tak boleh lah
oh macam tu boleh cakap apa ah
macam tu boleh cakap lah
tak tau ah other than philosophy takde mmhmm
kali nak nak lebihkan pada scandinavian countries tu
mm sebab nak tengok
mm tengok system dia
mm ya lah yang tu semua memang nak repeat
tapi ah a'ah a
termasuk lah
kalau tak kan
lepas lepas bukan sweden denmark mm
euro centric tak tak western lah
sebab kita tak consider canada ya tapi
sebab dia punya ni kot dia punya historical value
kalau asian countries entah north korea
mm mm sebab tu
sebab tu macam history kat sini pun kadang-kadang dengar pun macam made up stories sebab dia tak perlu preserve kan
aiyo tak tahu pun
mm mm tapi the sangat kan
takde lah dia bukannya kalau being stoic ke macam terus eliminate ke
so sebab lagi muda lagi orang akan
ambil seriously kot sebab dia tengok macam umur lima belas dah start buat semua ni
lepas tu tapi still ambil lah sebab nanti mungkin boleh guna untuk summer study kan
mm apa lagi ah tukar
entah tukar nama tak ah tak tahu lah
takde tak against sangat pun against ah against against sekolah semua sekolah yang I pergi
I went to seven schools and takde yang betul-betul
dapat tarik interest untuk belajar kan dia punya
ya lah ini memang lah semua orang faham lah mm bukan kita jer faham semua orang tahu benda ni
kalau korang start
sembang pasal education system jer lah memang macam gini jer lah dia punya outcome
kat internet
tapi ada laptop kan
ambil ah
entah macam mana kalau lockdown lagi kan tak guna
bukan a'ah
hampa jer
mm lapan minit ni
boleh cakap pasal apa your hope was a upper you hook

ya lah dia beyond kita punya control kan tapi still okay lah kalau betul ada change yang boleh nak tengok nak tengok
a'ah maknanya takde campur tangan
tak tak kesah lah politician ke sesiapa pun banyak yang kalau nak
some sort of gain dia akan main dengan
a'ah dengan sentiment agama kan mm
just kalau nak tengok ni boleh lah tengok kat Facebook comments jer dah cukup dah
so banyak yang memang tak
biasa ah benda ni biasa yang dia nampak tajuk jer lepas tu dia terus comment mm mm
itu pun uh itu
a'ah a'ah a'ah betul
kita kena blame juga journalism bad journalism dia memang
tak boleh ah dia dia kena fikir lah uh siapa
dia kena fikir juga untuk orang yang malas membaca ni dia kena bagi title tu memang terus
mm click bait okay tapi kalau kalau buat video YouTube okay kot
tapi kalau buat err news header jangan lah
sebab tu lah yang orang baca pasal vaksin ni juga ada side effect eh bukan side effect dia dah ambil ah
mm mm padahal baru ambil yang first shot tu kan
tapi orang terus rasa macam cakap oh K maknanya vaksin tak berkesan atau apa lah
ya lah memang itu yang dia jadi sepanjang adanya
it is err sejak kelahiran journalism
yang penting jalan yang penting dapat duit advertisement mm
tapi itu lah benda ni yang kita memang dah selalu sangat sembang teliti macam tu lah lagi authentic
mm kita dah bual benda ni dah dah berapa kali dah sebelum ni sorry
ini call of duty

err sadly due to the circuit breaker the the zoo closed down jadi terpaksa cari tempat lain lah nak kerja tau err
but err I would say the experience there is err pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of macam tourists
I feel macam the camaraderie is is very ya
true lah I mean then again stung lah so people will want avoid tempat-tempat yang crowded lah ramai orang kan susah apa
oh then you quit lepas tu after that few week
so like macam freshie ah
tak payah lah tak payah
oh they approve of your ni lah
you must be worth it lah you kerja keras for a bit only then you graduate with two majors bro everyone wants you man
true lah true lah there's a lot of ya there's a lot of work lah you want to jaga both double major and your part time job it's too much ah even I will crazy man
ah ya hal ehwal masing-masing lah
are you taking of err joining any macam like the malay atau join silat ke silat
macam banyak of my friends lah yang from my err secondary school
all of us decided to join silat together lah
since uh dah rapat kan and then we understand each other
ya then lebih baik lah better for us lah
ya but macam not really official lah I I had to give up the role kepada yang
my best friend yang I feel that it's more suitable lah cause I busy lah with work
kerja then I need to jaga my nenek and atuk
ah speaking of that err about family kan how how are you err ayah and mama
dia orang okay lah
aiyo dia masih belajar situ lah alamak
so macam like err kirakan dia punya pelajaran is a bit uh staggered behind lah is it
but but the your your brother is a genius lah budak pandai kan so shouldn't be an issue lah for him
ya ya my err yang paling kecil lah she taking O level this year
she seems pretty ready I guess sebab dia macam revise lah at home
she err staying up like lewat malam just to macam she catch up on her revision
err nasihat nasihat yang baik lah orang katakan lah ya
ya as suri teladan lah to her
ya her birthday is coming though so I'm pretty excited to celebrate dia punya hari jadi ya
err bulan depan I think early early early august ya
your dad's birthday is coming also right in two months dua bulan from now
ah boleh celebrate sama sama ah macam gitu ah
cause she's been applying for kerja kerja yang macam full time dekat ah those art companies lah last I heard is the teaching lah
she might err ajar budak secondary school so she went
ya ya she's up sebagai our best lah ya the prestige programme lah in our school you know junior college ya
ya she tried lah so now tunggu result jer lah see what the says if if approve then she gets into lah if not
you need two to three minggu from now
ya I feel super disappointed ah I mean kalau tak I already had plans or to travel around europe lah
and then catch the the swiss alps but macam biasa lah people wouldn't think lor
and ya and err on the bright side also nasib baik lah cause I save a lot of money I mean the money I can use it to beli rumah ke
ya oh ya then ah how's your your dad's ah youtube channel ada masa upload upload videos tak
ya betul
so you expect the baby to appear at eh appear eh they expect for the baby to be born lah in err dalam late november begitu
ya all of us are pretty excited lah kita even macam dah buat a baby shower um eh not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone punya spirits lah given ya this macam hard
ya and I and my kakak wen is the
anak pertama lah to carry a child for the family
so ya my my mother and my uh brother-in-law punya mother both of them plan out lah the this party for us
so harap harap err it's going to be fun err it's gonna happen I think ah early next month also
ya her mother will masak makanan for us and then after that my mum will plan out dia punya games and
err aktiviti-aktiviti lah yang kita akan buat on that day itself
the government punya pantang larang kan mesti ikut
kita respect respectable lah
eh jangan lah
malu lah
because she can still err go to work lah but her macam orang atas don't want her to come
because he works at the port right so he helps err he is a I think I think he's an engineer then dia tolong macam pasang lah kalau ada any macam equipment yang rosak
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he macam gembira ah like wow finally he get a job ah
err ah school err apa tu yuran ya yuran sekolah unlike us lah for for
then dia orang tayangkan the whole thing on err facebook live
so they will be like oh ah school of engineering dekat bawah jer nama-nama dia punya students ya in that slow
so in that zoom session dia orang ada buat macam lucky draw lah so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods err jabra elite mostly macam those school technology gadgets lah
ya dia lagi sikit menang seh she said err she said err the one that wins ya it's usually like either dua ke atas dua ke bawah so
I actually ordered err ice cream untuk dia so like
ya then kat rumah I think got no one so uh ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure lah cause the number is
ah the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her lah but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that dia balik sebelum
so mana tahu ah got nasib ah time tujuh then baru hantar
sudah macam one package already
to macam give her I I heard they give her like cremeway alright for her to munch cause of her support for you
aku tahu semua ni ya
that's very nice okay oh it's a chinese girl I I I I forgot I thought it was a I've I've always thought that it will be macam err mixed girl lah
oh really I tak perasan
oh so she's also in our university juga lah
oh she any idea which err kursus she admit in our school
oh wee kim wee is a oh jangan bilang you take double major because of her go wee kim wee
you jangan main-main ni ah
ya pretty surprising eh terkejut I you know
faham lah faham lah
so that macam so far takde macam concrete plans lah with a it's just like you guys
ya lah nanti orang cakap apa kan kalau kita iya lah terlalu excited all then
dude I really want to I really want to but susah lah ni
probably satu dua jam then after that you have to sleep because your work in the next day and
paiseh sangat
jadi kalau awak macam interested kan you can actually join us lah because we just need one more one more person to play the lead guitar we have nadia on the
and then we have err loofy on the keyboard and I'll be paying the drums so we just need someone to fit in the role as pemain guitar lah for us so do you uh interested
uh this is sometime next week dalam hari either jumaat atau sabtu
tengok ah loofy macam mana ah loofy dia memang kadang-kadang suka main-main ah dia macam tak tak serious ya
ya that time dia ni dia dia kerja dekat challenger juga for one day
then after that he I think he fought with his manager that's why he had it lah cause I think the manager kind of bully him also but given he's aggressive nature kan so he macam he quit on the very day also lah
he quit lah I mean ya it they kind of buang him lah he even though he is as as as aggressive as he gets dia punya orang baik sebenarnya
he was the top scorer lah for our class though I don't know ah for A level surprisingly dia punya result didn't reflect
so macam a bit hampa and disappointment
err ya we doing before solat
then after that we pergi solat sama-sama
oh ya ya ya me and loofy kita orang dah apply dah earlier earlier beforehand we apply already
but usually dia punya slot usually cepat ambil lah pasal dia pakcik-pakcik semua dia orang always wants slots right
ah usually the tingkat satu ah closer to the imam
oh no no no no no err now now the wuduk you take from home ah then
ya they they close off the matikan all the air lah
ya tu lah kita orang tak nak banyak interaction lah with other so we keep it at the minimal lah
but who knows you might fist bump juga in the masjid also lah maybe I mean
mm but this is all purely just speculation lah ya bukan betul kan
mm so makan biasa-biasa jer lah like mee rebus dengan mee soto
wow nasi sambal goreng bang dia punya rendang apa
kau kena try bro
tak tak tak sempat because I bangun like just nice at the ninety four minutes mah
then just nice lah so like I terbangun then like oh my god dah pukul lima eh so the next thing I do was I ambil wuduk then I prepare for subuh lah
so ya cik jamal
ya he was lah but he he don't want to macam made me conform to any err beliefs lah
ya it's like he wants me to have the freedom to choose apa team yang I nak support
understandable lah dia orang dekat kan
boleh masuk champions league ya
oh jauh sangat lah
sean jadi millionaire
so any message you want me to hantarkan sampaikan kepada mister havi
I think tiga puluh tahun kan and I think
he's been waiting for this lah dah lama seh he tunggu go their win right
so he really it really bucks him lah when they don't don't win a match or dia orang tak tak uh perform as well as he nak dia orang to perform lah
my as a firefighter ya and kita dulu masuk the station together together
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy ah kat yishun situ
the daerah canberra
meanwhile they told us in training is lain what from what you are going experience real life
oh oh so so you so you were like macam patrolman lah gitu ronda-ronda around the area
wah they are not worrying ah like you I mean do you get calls often or macam takde masalah ke in the area
oh err I mean like since you are posted in a the area macam tak ramai orang kan so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
macam tak pressure lah orang tak I don't feel macam orang bully you or anything
ah dia orang macam
hibur-hiburkan lah so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
oh lari-lari anak around area
but but usually berapa jauh you run
macam the only only time I ran jauh gitu is back when I was in serving my lah they make us run around ubin
and I think that's the way lah macam orang tak tahu you cannot drink a lot kalau nak minum sikit jer kalau boleh jangan minum at all
uh habis
thirty minutes baru jer minum that that's the ideology that
ah macam
ya it's about biology larh and then oh ada mention yang if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
ya it it can be that and also you didn't ni lah um ah wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so kita tak boleh kita tak boleh push too much lah nanti orang cakap kan
but ya berapa banyak juice you suka minum in one day selalu
okay true lah because like for me macam I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks kan macam air air air yang sweet ni semua
boleh mendatangkan kencing manis so
ya so uh at home pun I only got air masak
jadi most of the time the only ah the best alternative would definitely be juices ah
oh no I don't like to buy all these macam manufactured punya cause I feel macam dia tak mendatangkan any
apa tu benefit lah so I selalu beli pergi pasar then I beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan
ah biji biji buah-buahan then I balik I potong I blend
then I letak air then I minum ah
it's right way ya my ni if you if you if you if you got the time my ni always recommend lah when you blend kan you blend dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali
ah dengan kulit-kulit dia but the biji the biji you take out
okay lah the kulit err
oh ya ya ya apa dia apa I heard some fruits eh if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good lah jadi kena macam pandai-pandai lah
ya oh eh grapefruit dengan grape is lain eh tak sama eh
grapefruit dengan grape dia orang tak sama kan dia orang two different fruits ah lain kan
siapa ah yang come out eh nama-nama ni
tu lah
lain eh aiyo
because I started a business selling tahu begedil selling tahu begedil yes
basically because I like to eat tahu begedil
um quite recently eh ah like last month ah late last month when tahu begedil was was like a trend
um tahu begedil and they both
apa tu macam ada lah dia punya kesedapan tu kan ya
for a while because ibu force me to
but um making this tahu begedil of course I only started recently
um eh I mean there were no macam kedai taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
so I think ah this tahu begedil I will only sell bila ada time lah macam holidays
so maybe like maybe the next week is not tahu begedil it's like
oh I didn't call I didn't name it but ibu and abang named it as
bawal yes tudung bawal you know there's square scarf
um one is the our cotton bawal and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk bawal and our cotton bawal it sells
kita suka try benda like try to do things new things and we try to ya lah
we hustle a lot macam tak kesah ah kalau hari-hari kerja
asalkan like kita boleh rasa duit tu ah
ah inshallah wah untuk ah benda yang halal
oh like mati macam melayu
apa tu open casting for new models
like tak suka ambil gambar and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a hijabi model
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't simpan because the quality is like shit
and then I come back with just a piece of tudung for me it's like merepek so
ibu um
apa ni um shops coming to you uh for shooting she said then okay lah I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
people also come to me um to do to create apa to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
I don't know whatever barang that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried uh an influencer before to boost start my um Kamash um the tudung brand
apa tu our
to the company first let them approve apa-apa macam if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people ah macam tambah-tambah lah ah themselves and then they
then they send back to us then baru kita copy paste and then put
selling clothes selling muslimah clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
macam ah you need to do your research err do survey do prototype everything
um sellers terdahulu biasa about apa yang dorang suka instead of what
you get what I mean macam they
assume that orh aku suka ni so confirm orang lain akan suka
pasal um a lot of people say eh ni lawa confirm ada orang suka confirm ada orang suka but we cannot hear what our family members really um say we need to reach out to people
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum ah she said like orh ni colour cantik everything whatever shit
but then actually salah ah it's not selling our first
simple macam not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful tapi a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like eh eh ni mana ada orang pakai cotton lagi kan panas kan panas but it sell out like a lot um we bought I'm ten colours
bila dah membesar right sambil membesar
ya sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar tau apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then ibu tak suka so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
um she said oh you know um macam she tell told me all the negative things lah all the
it's like jaga mayat jaga mayat and then like
but of course ibu also tak kasi because she say I will mati cepat the I'm like kalau ajal tu ada mati lah I mean like we cannot
macam mana nak cakap eh like
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what ibu wants me to do lah
is the hantu remember
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little masih kecil kan that time
uh apa tu um aku rugi lah mm mm
obviously tahu begedil I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like oh I need to to control myself because
dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil kan
tak okay aku tak boleh tak makan but if I can
apa seh
even if people bila
silat ya but then we stop because like um
the penjuru is it the guru the head of the silat or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he campur with
benda tak elok lah um with
jin yes
no sister his sister yang ini kat luar I it was at sengkang it was at sengkang you know those macam got court badminton court ya we silat there
one point of time macam tengah buat benda sendiri ah and then like
tapi like I saw this guru and this student like a teenage student
um tengah terbaring tau
the guru is like macam gitu macam baca-baca then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like um like what macam dia sakit ke I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person rasuk lah katakan
one of our uncle also was in the same silat with us siapa tu ah ariff ah he quitted first and then we quit
I feel like is a traditional err okay um one thing I learned about silat while doing my research for my last time was
the their silat is actually
a'ah tekan
like how to say um okay selalunya sekarang orang kat luar kan dorang gaduh kan dia rembat jer tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu when they are in a battle
um they tunjuk respect to one another first and they you know buka bunga is where you show like oh are you ready
to silat then ya
ya macam gitu lah
last time they really gold the adat lah
various lah silat taekwando
as long as you belah after two weeks ah I don't mind
like being straightforward it's like just say lah like oh apa I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
like uh aku akan ambil macam angkat ah baju-baju kotor ni but some people see it as rude macam orh
uh so macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini ah aku kena buat semua benda ah kat rumah ni
ya the melayu so formal I cannot
ah no we only speak it when ada oral ke
with abang
biasanya with abang or ibu a bit lah macam gini lah like transition between english and malay but for hilah hundred percent english
ah I also don't know eh but um one of my friends like dia sekarang dalam uni and he is a
he major in journalist bahasa melayu lah so
language ya macam ada perkataan like tak pernah dengar and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so macam I feel like
bahasa melayu ni is not for today lah
orang dulu-dulu because orang dulu
macam bahasa baku kan
along the way people macam get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of dekat kau kena
lima minit short tak apa lah
kat rumah that's all
oh so most of the time during the holiday kau kat kerja ah
ah okay okay oh ya lah that time kau bilang kan ah
ya okay lah but still know because of this pandemic right tak banyak orang ah so the you know the lorong right when they all usually like ah lalu right
true lah but tetap masih ada macam budak townees ah
no no no as in like I only started few weeks ago so ya kirakan baru start ah
semangat masih boil ah
ya alhamdulilah dah dah dapat ah
I confirm stress tapi I think it's manageable lah
masing-masing ah
ngam-ngam lah that you all that like dah rapat already
but all this uh all budak history ah
track and field lah but silat
at least ya at least you all know betul-betul joining together ah
oh oh okay okay okay awesome kirakan too much commitment ah
cause you know dia kan belajar kat china kan so when he came back
masih ah but then when he come back
you're like going there physically cause kan medicine kena buat those like physical
ya so now he just lepak kat rumah you know
dia kan ambil kan
you have to do what you have to do ah sebagai you know the abang-abang besar kan
mm ya betul correct correct
what bila ah
bulan oh september ya correct correct
oh that means apply kat
ah kau dah biasa dah buat kan
I mean you did throughout your few years kat the uh
mm mm ya that's good but bila ah bila the results keluar
kalau apa-apa ke apa-apa you just update me ah cause
so so boleh macam you know meet up minum kopi chat chat
ya see but I guess tu kau punya rezeki ah
maybe it's it's better ya kau punya nasib ah better that you've stayed in singapore
cause and then again like the virus situation so belum contain right
oh ya ya ya so have you save up save up for the you know the eventual you punya
oh ya ya ya do it do it do it err I would say it's quite erratic ah dia punya upload like
err cause he has a few differing passions lah kan ah so the initial golf err content that he used to upload right has been on a hub for awhile lah so this sekarang like this past few days he's been you know more interested in collecting airplane models
quite canggih ah for his age
this is the first time kurang experience
ah ya ya ya ya betul betul betul
ya kena ikut dia punya apa
the syarat-syarat
very diligent ah ikut dia punya
err undang-undang ah
dia okay
tu yang penting ah
ya I mean furthermore ours even more mahal lah dia punya apa school the yuran lah so
mmhmm kerja bayar jer uh this ah very efficient ah
slow jer like star wars punya the highlight reel ah
mm dia kan punya
is it held on apa which platform zoom
oh yang the sekolah dah apa sponsor
bro macam mana bro
the thing dah cair ah
but right that means if she's not at home then they won't leave it kat depan pintu ah
ya you know those the standard ones at the floral express where there are they put my macam
ya the standard one ah ya err cukup for that show some appreciation lah
you know sedekah
tu lah it's the standard lah you know how
no lah no no dude that one that one purely my rezeki ah
nasib ah nasib
well I guess communication is key ah yang penting ah so
potential nak kena backfire ah you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it macam tame first
furthermore kalau main also like
so cannot play sampai lambat also kan
tak betul ah ah I know ah
oh apa ni
baik tau
he quit or kena buang
oh but ya I heard back then dia punya temper also quite
but kalau I think
I should be down to jam with you all lah kalau jumaat lepas solat
if you want to go together then kena apply online kan to get the queue
dia orang fast game ah dah apply online
the best seats is tingkat berapa
takde yang rapatkan saf lah
kena expand
the wuduk area now they dia orang taruh apa sanitizer
so then that means salam pun tak boleh ah
orang only the orang atas would know lah all what is set in stone lah
and that one pun mostly kat my
ya so it's the same old kedai kopi and err you know the mall right ya
ya the standard breakfast punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng
ah okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that macam dah second nature kan ambil wuduk
oh cik jamal oh I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest punya supporter
cause you punya opponent mm
mid table but kalau menang the last two matches then
a bit out of reach ah ya jauh sangat
tu yang quite disappointing ah
um win ah so syabas to them
dua puluh tahun is it ya liverpool won punya premier league
but I will have to say ah dia punya though he quite semangat ah
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be melampau ah
is he is he still the regular kat your fire station
mm no doubt lah he is really a budak baik lah
biasa ah you know just
ya so a bit sedih ah
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I kena posted kat foxtrot division ah tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat this area ah
oh I would say there's a fair share of calls lah there's there's still ongoing back then lah err but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like macam woodlands jurong
but no doubt lah there's always calls here and there lah whether their severity macam
ya I I feel the same way ah as as much as like you know the berita dia orang cover and all these cases of
macam mismanagement
I think it's isolated punya cases
cause biasanya macam
tak macam gitu ah usually it's more civilized and laid back ah I would say nothing much going on ah
kan kena stay active kan
ya but I think is tak susah ah tak susah sangat lah but it's
kena biasakan so
mm cause when you when you first start lah like after one ten and then usually you togok air like melampau ah but
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree ah kan I mean cause banyak orang banyak orang tak
tak begitu informed lah about this kind of stuff ah so
it is the right way lah is to jangan minum banyak ah you have to conserve
like macam
kena full cool down mode already ah
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little lah it's cause you you minum melampau ah basically
ah that's true lah cause kalau kau minum banyak kan the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
kau punya badan is like you know get gets in a shock
uh so the more you biasakan with more water then the more likely you will
kenakan the effects of that heatstroke ah
ni semua kena belajar ah
mm yang tepat ah
oh the biji ah biji
biji-biji kecil ah
the biji take out then you blend the kulit but but then
bila kau minum kan
oh do you blend the kulit ah
but kau kena
kau kena like see first lah whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars ah before kau tambah extra sugar or anything lah when you blend
with the sugar level already dah cukup already
tak payah tambah extra stuff
ah lain
err grapefruit is besar sikit
sama sama ya
ya it's uh pelik sia
ya but kau kena potong ah before you put dalam you punya blender
dia dengan the what's the girl's name ah
dia dengan fy dah berapa lama together
nothing much ah I tadi cause I got sekolah what
so it's just school from home ah sekarang
pay attention sikit sikit
but then cause my fridays free ah so I got nothing to do I thought boleh kerja sambil-sambil
kat sana kerja dah punya lah senang
but then my rest also dorang bayar
but then dorang tak nak ambil cause I still schooling ah then they say like apa ni
aku actually boleh kerja sia
then gitu duit masuk so senang ah but then wasted lah I never think of it lah
dah lama ah tak makan sana because like
diam sudah no ah I mean like
but hijrah barang lama ah now the people there all
faiz faiz lagi extreme no I think faiz is like the epitome of extreme you know
going to the gym person pasal like my friend all say like if I go gym all ah
dorang semua cakap like macam confirm badan pau punya ah
but gym just very intimidating ah like aku rasa macam
seram ah like go there people all tengok-tengok semua
tapi kecil is okay you know kecil cause
but like if you see orang gemuk kan orang gemuk confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy semua pe
I don't know ah later people kat gym tengok like eh try hard pe this guy
forever sia macam gini
at least I looked proportionate ah like don't look so bulat
then these days I want to check already but my parents tak tukar the battery ah for the
no not really after ah after still got a lot of outfields semua pe so we still keluar banyak-banyak
makan banyak ah cause of
then it's cause of ah always order in asyik beli jer then sekali
dah getting rounder ah
the longer you are in army right the more lepak the
rumah ella kat mana eh oh ya ya ya correct correct correct
uh uh rumah ella
kat belakang ah
like from rumah ella you walk to tracks
then there's a coffee shop there ah Fatty Bom Bom kat sana
eh it doesn't make sense leh I mean like okay like kau tahu uh
but then in this case like abang gemuk and Fatty Bom Bom no difference what both halal already what
so like they tukar nama for what sia
that time also ada ah
so like like when I go lia's house senang ah
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes sampai ah
uh kau tahu dunman sec kat mana
ah dekat ah
malas pe dah cakap malas nak exercise
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance yang jauh it's like
ya but like macam
confirm malas sia nak keluar it's easier for you to just order
but that one tengok ah kalau
if only kalau ada discount ah
uh then then got the then got the telur so it's like more like fried rice like that lah
I never try abang gemuk before ah so cannot say ah
but a bit mahal ah that day I eat it's like six ninety
pasal dorang dorang bagi banyak ah
tak tapi even though the portion worth kan but I feel like it's like two people portion ah
macam the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
but over there they give the full bowl ah then the ayam pun dorang bagi dua
I think new ah the shop dulu takde ah
I don't really remember ah because usually dulu kita orang makan sana
always makan the
I play public game like macam
always kena thrashed ah
then aku tunggu kau download warzone sampai sekarang belum download
kental lah
I don't know how come your computer semua games tak boleh sia
like it's more to like main sendiri
like cause dorang ada macam like a energy system like that
then kau boleh buat the stuff you need to do ah
you finish what you need to do already then just tunggu ah
better than runescape ah tapi
like kau kena tunggu ah resin kau fill up baru kau boleh main
console pun ada
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales ah they spent banyak ah
dude gila like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
like empat ribu lima ribu
so it's like really luck based ah tengok ah your luck macam mana
pernah pernah ah ah last time I buy the skin
so macam I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like lima belas eh
wasteful ah spend duit kat game
ada ah additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
it it makes a difference but like macam
tak leh nampak sangat ah like you need like
so tak rasa sangat
uh uh kau macam tak you like don't know me like that ah
hmm sejak bila
like kau compare dengan basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
a'ah tapi tapi bola macam
like I book my solat jumaat tak dapat
dah lama sia
tapi tak dapat ah
since the booking start I never I never kena dapat I think cause I always book late ah
so dah semua all the slots dah fill up kan then dah tak boleh
dah tak boleh dapat slot ah
then uh aku tak leh buat for the next five weeks
a'ah so other people can get ah but some more aku selalu tak dapat ah
tak tahu ah
tak nak ah
tengok kerusi all
uh and streamers uh aku tengok mostly streamers pakai the ini ah Secret Lab one
asal mahal sangat sia it's just a chair right
tak ah tapi tapi even though
it's leather you know leather actually murah seh
tak tahu ah
I mean you you said it yourself right like dorang apa similar kan
sama ah
I mean okay warranty dia is apa one for one exchange or what
macam tak masuk akal right like
kau ambil pisau kau potong seh already
okay how about macam kalau air tumpah
air tumpah on the thing
okay but what if it's like kau tumpah kan Coke
that time that time siapa eh tunjuk aku uh I think
achap ah achap tunjuk aku the video
orang pakai Coke
untuk cuci toilet
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks ah like even time hari raya kan
uh okay usually guest just eh uh tuan rumah dorang selalu just tuang kan
my my nenek punya side more of Coke ah so they got like
then another container is all just uh apa ni F&N
ya hari raya
so if I go my nenek house
it's really just gassy drinks atau teh
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea gitu
apa eh the other one yang ah the hijau one the hijau one sedap ah
tak tapi the best one I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but susah ah nak cari like everywhere I go like most most kedai tak jual ah
it confirm pernah it's the orange colour one
but sekarang susah nak cari I think they stopped production already ah I haven't I haven't seen it
takde takde takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit
takde duit takde table tennis
I think no more already confirm dorang dah buang punya like the thing so lup sup you know
macam repeat
then macam
tak ah tapi sekarang not that bad because like
but then eh you got lobang for kerja or not
I don't know ah like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all semua yang tak halal
aku tak pernah kerja banquet
yang sebelah yang sebelah Hard Rock Cafe
ya cause uh my friend from dulu kerja
uh like the table chair stage semua dorang set up
then usually it's for like reception gitu ah wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just tunggu for the event to finish then they teardown
but dorang punya is more for ini kan is like
like apa ni concerts semua kan
kat Shangri-La that that type
he just delegate the work semua then duduk goyang kaki goyang ah
kerja senang ah tak yah buat banyak sangat ah
oh ya but Marche tak halal lah
eh jangan gini ah
berbual really like proper english punya you know and like
a bit more to the mahal side ah
then dia dapat banyak apa ni
uh banyak freebies semua
but then dia kira balik kan actually what he paid for
but I heard the cakes there good ah the the kuih lapis cake ah
should try ah should try go there makan
can ajak C what
eh eh you tell her first ah eh I'm not gonna pay for you mm bayar sendiri
muka sedih ugh
I I I think nanti aku re-watch ah
I think it's like a company just uh macam get all these people kan
then dorang buat macam a short video macam as a skit
kau imagine macam
macam key and peele
okay ah tapi no matter how many times I re-watch eh
kekek gila ah I will still laugh and laugh and laugh ah
like semalam semalam adik aku main the
key and peele yang mana eh
what apa what's name eh
asal achap tak leh
I thought and him best friend already just now talk on Discord macam
macam brother eh
nanti nanti nanti there he he sniff all our cigarettes sia
tengok ah nanti I play for fun ah
apex apex game dia macam mana
tapi dia punya graphics semua macam cartoon-ish kan
oh uh kira kan macam halo kind of graphic ah
busy dengan sekolah
tapi sekarang five berapa
is now is mahal cause orang resell eh
I don't know ah like semua orang like rebut nak beli P eh actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console lah
ada ah main ah
like when I go to my apa ni cousin's house
aku dari dulu kan like
my parents macam
but computer pun my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
dorang like cakap okay uh haris uh
kau main twenty minutes
my father ah my father cakap like eh haris uh okay ah
suddenly like everyone kat uh kat luar then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the
so my father cakap dengan the salesperson the salespersons cakap like
eh cik if you want to buy game boy
dah ah tak ah tak yah panggil gemuk pe
the once the slim one come out semua beli ah
I think it's cause it's different lah like you don't really have any console yang kau boleh use touch screen kat bawah tapi still got the tactile buttons
just want to show off features ah ada dual screen kind of
no but Switch still got ada ada animal crossing ada
but quite popular what aku tengok banyak orang sia main
tak pernah ah
oh okay okay faham faham ya
until now I I looking to play it again you know but tak leh jumpa ah it's called what is it called eh uh
total war tak pernah ah
ya apa eh got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro yang
korang boleh like form a squad then do like
apa ah nama dia
oh oh is it is it the one yang kau kena kena fix the generators semua
I never see before ah ipin I only see him post punya video ah
for one hero no cause in is as long as you play a hero banyak-banyak kan
so kalau kau nak clamp the ranking kena main banyak ah
ya for other country is by state so like johor macam johor will be
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to macam separate semua orang
okay ah for me I find it interesting also but I not so into it sampai
so macam like the
malay heritage semua kan dia tahu ah
the different type of culture semua
quite cool eh actually cause like apparently orang melayu really
they control like the whole trade route semua
now semua
what what you want to makan
kau tengok Guga Foods ah
like with the with the what do you call that the onions semua
eh but guga he got his own ini sia industrial size tempat masak grill
at in his home there's like a restaurant punya size punya grill
no ah I think they slowly ini ah
purchase like I think they see it as macam business purchase gitu
cause dorang beli semua is to promote their channel what in the end
so he memang nak
he buy the good stuff lah like his knife semua bagus punya all like
ah ya ya ya correct correct they buy dia beli the knife from like macam garage sale like that
ah ya the rust out semua
but then yang ini okay ah yang you know those kanjiro kind
uh huh tak kan ah dorang jual
then is dorang jual like legit kira kan like boleh potong orang punya
that one quite ni ah he but that guy keluar kan samurai sword ah
to potong someone
and lastly err the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world sebab bila you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good ah when you can do things yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat
mm pasal ilmu ni but dia ada banyak err rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi hmm kalau dapat ni best ah pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat mm and bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni mm
so ini adalah yang tiga wishes yang saya nak mm so kita err what about you fathul
pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh spend on whatever and what not and bila awak dapat spend whatever and what not then means err with every spending awak akan rasa this happiness
kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang teleport ke tempat lain so dia jadi the source of this err kuman lah so dia yang spread to others
dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus mm so I stay over this view whereby teleportation could actually increase
okay mungkin awak dah cakap ini okay maybe saya agree sikit
maybe awak ada point over there
tapi yang contact tracing tu mungkin tak tak senangkan lah
pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia teleport kalau dia sendiri dah suka teleport
mm tapi ini interesting point of view mm so kalau awak tanya saya apa superpower yang saya nak saya nak power of regeneration
so contohnya err jari saya terpotong ah nanti dia akan heal sendiri
saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki dislocate ah dia regenerate sendiri
dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak kan nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang high risk
itu meminta kematian lah
think of living in isolation uh maybe one maybe satu hari bila dah dah experienced everything yang kita nak ah
okay mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya and betul lah yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena
sebab tanpa kita bergaul dengan orang we will never know what they face
so for example bila kita tahu orang ini menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong so kita akan mencari solution untuk menolong seseorang itu
so mungkin apa awak cakap err betul juga ah and tapi bila awak err saya
hmm hairan lah kenapa awak err question bila seseorang itu nak isolate maybe for months
his child behind then anak-anak dia akan merana ah and
kalau months okay months maybe saya rasa maksimum err maybe not more than nine months ah
lesser than that mungkin okay
kenapa nine months sebab within this nine months um budak tu dia akan grow and after this nine months
okay soalan tu interesting sepuluh tahun means sebelas tahun yang lalu
sebelas tahun yang lalu okay saya definitely akan suruh diri saya err ini ah invest ah invest in bitcoin
sebab at umur ten years old memang awak cakap betul uh nak nak faham tentang certain barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat convince ah
satu orang ni at ten years old dia akan ingat
and maybe along the way mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas and then dia akan start
err thinking back err apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak
ah adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya ten years bila saya ten-year-old akan betul
so mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan err um akan interest awak ah pasal maybe one day juga awak akan jadi famous because of this ah
err some luck you managed to stay alive ah so for you err apa yang experience awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian
I need to add on apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati
it happens whereby we have to train where err train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so kita orang kena capsize habis tu bila capsize ini kita kena grab kawan kita punya kayak
and get back up ah so bila saya tengah practice capsize ini
instructor jauh so kita jauh daripada semua orang
habis tu kita bila saya tengah capsize kawan saya dia lose control of dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah capsize terus saya tap saya punya kayak
bila saya tengok terbalik ini so kawan saya punya bot tak ada
saya dekat situ saya stuck ah saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada skirt skirt ini akan prevent water from entering our kayak
nak keluarkan skirt tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh so saya tap kuat-kuat
tap kuat-kuat uh in hope that kawan saya dengar saya ah pasal saya tengah dekat
dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia so saya tap tap tap dia tak dengar alright bila dia dengar ini dia kata ah lepas incident dia cuba paddle tapi I tolak dia so dia nak paddle susah sikit
so saya dekat bawah air maybe for one minute ah

that's why he always have like macam err playful fights with thor I think new zealanders and australians have
ya but I heard kau kau learn a lot during kau punya
ya lah I mean daripada kau tak ada kerja then um kau just want to get a
kau went over and ask for apa yang tu err
apa yang kau pergi minta err bidan then dia orang bilang engkau suruh ambil err hairdressing kan
to think balik
you know at least kau sudah
walaupun macam kau think balik now now kau think balik err whatever that kau err going through
before kau tak ada kerja and then kau tengah
kau dapat that skills err future now kau sudah ada that that sudah ada that skill the only thing kau want to progress
but um do you think macam you have gone you think kau sudah pergi quite far juga eh
berapa tahun eh semua kau dah berapa tahun agak-agak kau ah gunting eh
oh semua ini satu tahun saja
oh daripada two thousand and nineteen
tapi kau suka juga ke I mean sekarang ni kau dah come to a point yang macam kau
find it macam dah terlalu err repetitive ah kan
mm habis kalau kau
if you are given a chance untuk um
sound engineer atau gunting rambut
eh the other day kau pergi err airport
dengan anak kau eh semua birthday eh
oh oh she went out dengan your folk your folk ah
kau kau ada ini tak bagi tahu dia yang err aku send regards
I see all good brother pasal ya ya lah I mean budak budak kecil right they
ya I I think kau punya anak quite err pintar eh
macam quite intelligent eh
macam ya lah kecil habis err
degil which is kan bagus ah ke tak degil degil dia ke tak
ada lah ada that's err it's been quite awhile man
it's been quite awhile geng pasal ya um
err you know lah pasal
COVID you know err I think the last one kita met was probably before
COVID right it was uh kau datang sini um
the recording yang aku nak nak minta kau tolong untuk aku pergi
is there anymore yang kau datang rehearsal is there any rehearsal
mm lama ah about diam tak diam dah
ah dah enam bulan ah
so ya tapi dah oh no dengan ayah tu is probably when uh farhan ah
kita nak work on lagu farhan ya
aku kind of tengah
tak ada tak ada majority things yang come to aku punya err aku punya life
I've now baru start main bicycle err aku baru beli bicycle err a cruiser
err aku just pergi cruising around dengan family aku
err other than that aku rasa aku working on some project macam
aku been doing a lot of err things kat
err nothing fantastic yang aku rasa tengah going on
which is err ah tapi
aku rasa tenang ah macam biasa ah
tenang ah so more more of and more more upcoming projects
yang akan kami you know macam
but paling boring is err tak dapat pergi err seberang tambak ah
itu yang paling boring ah pada aku for the past six months ini
sebab member member yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga
ah aku suppose I think err I think err dia bukan
ah maybe maybe betul pada kau macam in thing sebab semua orang
but the point is sebab tak ada
tak ada activity yang tak boleh keluar negeri jadi
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is juga
it's the best time untuk nak explore and then kita are much more older right now
I guess it's the exploration yang
it will stop orang kata macam
I mean time sekolah kita kan dulu explore kat bawah block lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh
err main
main tangkap spider at some point of time kan kita orang dah malas buat benda ni because kita nak kerja
so when kita dah kerja probably kita jumpa somebody
err bila mm jumpa kawan
ah nonsense buat nonsense nonsense punya barang then
aku rasa at this point of time pasal kita orang kena
jadi mungkin aku rasa that's the best time untuk um beriadah ah
untuk just do leisure out of
kau punya own comfort zone jadi this is the best time untuk kau come back to kau punya
err youth balik ke
you know where kau kau missing out
ah and aku rasa it's a good good good thing juga with this um
aku rasa kita will tend to macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita itself
ada this tempat ada that tempat ada
then kita pun tahu yang macam okay kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat right now apart from just makan
kita start to do cycling will start to explore macam
um tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi before
ah so aku rasa
it's good juga ah
but err kalau kau cakap about that is the the the in thing right now
but not just aku rasa ada orang pun buat not just err cycling tahu
but randomly but now is macam semua orang dah start to macam even
uh explore our own country punya whatever yang ada kat dalam ah not just bab makan jer
ya I mean yang kalau kau cakap pasal longkang it's definitely
at this point of time tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang
tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang tapi
but if there if there are thing macam tu aku rasa there will be possibilities pun pasal
pasal it's not macam something yang apa
something yang err
normal but aku rasa
might never know longkang tu pergi mana sekarang semua orang banyak go on the tahu
macam kira park connector punya
like recently aku just started cycle daripada where aku ah
yes and it was actually pada aku macam
oh and then kau tak kau tak nak explore right macam
so dude during that that that exploration tu
err aku from hougang going to bukit batok um go through macam
and you err you wouldn't you wouldn't realize ya macam
the park connectors are macam really boleh bawa kau macam daripada um
or daripada wherever daripada sini pun daripada
all the way boleh sampai ke clarke quay
clarke quay all the down all the way sampai dekat queenstown
from queenstown keluar pergi dekat buona vista
from buona vista all the way pergi bukit batok how's ah
going from the east side aku tak tahu there are such a thing macam itu tak
ah was it macam dah start dekat uh east area boleh kau realize tak
okay tak
I mean kau kau dah pergi ah juga tu ke ataupun kau
pass by ke kau jogging ke tak ataupun kau nampak jer
oh so sudah sudah kau sudah use that lah dekat
then daripada daripada uh
tampines to bedok ada you think
for now kau dah nampak yang tampines to pasir ris
hougang betul tak baru dia come dia come in right
look at that macam
eh kau err ini hari tak buat apa-apa ke sia
macam apa selalu kau buat on saturday
when you were in your mid twenties gitu
mm dia orang you know they they they they they even like
like now kan macam
go back in time tak
kau tak nak tak suka pergi east coast
kau rasa kau ada kau rasa kau ada penyakit tak with that
tak ah I mean aku cakap dengan kau pasal there are some people who
tak mandi err would would find themselves
it's actually bukan rabak ah punya penyakit it's just that something yang
yang penyakit yang tak familiar ah but you have that you know
huh it's not it's not a bad punya ini lah maksud aku macam kadang-kadang kan macam
ada orang uh tak boleh main dekat
err tak boleh main dekat rumput
ada so itu penyakit
mungkin pada kau it's something yang
macam orang tak familiar macam mungkin pada kau orang rasa kau macam leceh
tapi sebenarnya it's um
bukan pasal tu it's actually memang
it will affect kau punya
mood it will affect kau punya the the the
day yang kau bangun the next day it will affect macam
kau rasa um
ya it's as good as macam kau
might have a macam a feeling yang macam can occur sampai err
tak sedap ah you know tak sedap badan
tak lah tak lah pasal aku aku just wonder lah pasal kadang-kadang kan kenapa aku cakap east coast kan randomly juga pasal kan
err ya lah all this tempat or all this
things yang kita buat ni kan semua macam relate to apa yang aku dengan kau
boleh buat macam east coast was probably buat lagu
cause I guess macam tenang
tapi macam kadang-kadang um tenang but
in the night probably kalau ada kereta
kalau tak ada kereta um
then nak patah balik nak tidur you know macam you know
pagi pagi jer dah sian macam kira sudah pukul
pukul tiga pukul empat atau especially when the
sun is macam really on top of us memang take it will be like macam
ya kau
it was really it was really macam pain lah tapi kalau
kalau ada kenderaan you know um senang sikit kan
macam ataupun macam tak overnight lah you know grab or what not
so ya lah and yang macam
all these benda benda yang macam um
err exploration ini semua kan macam as kita grow
like aku rasa ini semua macam
things yang uh a cycle eh
kita cakap right now is like kau going to almost
err reaching kau punya four digits
ya aku sudah aku sudah forty ya
habis yang yang baru-baru ni semua kira time dekat COVID tu
kau just stay rumah ke ke kau ada cabut juga pergi mana-mana
kau takut tak time yang lockdown
pernah ada kau pernah ada sampai itu mentality tak
meaning macam really semua orang dah sakit and then
um went up to kau punya house ketuk ketuk ketuk ketuk macam zombie eh kita cakap macam
macam that kind ah lepas tu sekali macam
macam eh eh eh eh eh
open ah lepas tu macam eh
boy ah open ah itu macam that kind of thing ah
but this was before yang the first phase was the one yang
tak ada chance untuk keluar pun kan
kan that first few weeks kan at least a month tak keluar kan
so this phase two yang that one month tu
tak kan yang kedai-kedai gunting pun
yes and then ada phase two right
ya so this was macam the first
first few days yang when dia orang announce tak boleh keluar
ah aku was having so much err banyak banyak um
kind of macam err slowly slowly became macam
dalam diam aku did a lot of shopping you know macam
macam online shopping which is aku never that did did that before ah but I really did ah
and then ya it was really macam
like any other day any other day it was just macam two dollar punya shopee
three dollar punya stuff and then every
like every two three days mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku eh
but ya lah it was really funny that aku err ada that phase ah
because aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat eh
mm I mean being apa yang engkau nak buat
and then kita orang tak ada that that that that
tanah lapang you know we don't have a big um
kalau kau nak pergi luar to check people out pun macam
aku rasa that that experience was really macam best untuk aku ah
and then because aku pun ada at some point of time
err during that circuit time pun aku hantar
aku punya aku punya senior aku punya dad dekat hospital jadi
aku saw how the street are lonely
phase one is when everybody macam really macam
sudah come back to macam you know
I think yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka
during err apa err
during err circuit breaker punya time pun I think um
I did walk around lah macam pergi mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing ah macam
it was really macam almost to
almost to macam
being in the eighties balik where there is not much people around
but at the same time pun macam lonely juga
because kita pun will be hide inside
you know macam it's okay if you're younger
semua benda boleh boleh change kalau tak betul-betul you can change you punya
crazy also juga kan
so ya lah but still pun
ah the effect and I just macam for the
tak tahu how it will go on lah but I guess
this is one part of our life yang kita jumpa ah you know
it might happen again or it might happen again but lagi more ah
kerja ah it's not no work you know affected
aku rasa it's err more of err
tapi it's not the war of bombing lah gitu
it's macam um
macam um
it's macam
a smooth war ah you know a smooth war that macam
kita tak boleh expect that you know
kita tak boleh expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone macam
tak ada kerja or probably macam
where everyone was really macam
kerja atau tak kerja lah
ah but now is macam
or the environment macam play err err
make them to kind of macam stop from
oh itu lah itu lah um
aku pun macam kira macam wow after all these years err
I I was having a conversation the other day balik pada macam
ah you know macam err you know talking about
music in general macam macam err the whole world right now is err having
or the whole creative punya line in the whole wide world is um
habis aku was just err bagi tahu
err deedee the other day a friend of kau tahu deedee lah kan
so aku bagi tahu deedee about macam you know the rest of the world
um especially macam dekat and what not
dia orang punya creative was kind of macam stopped right now
kita orang was that macam kita orang tak ada industry and kita orang nak kena stop juga
so macam you get what I mean it's like macam um
macam ya lah
but kita orang kind of tak ada industry
pun nak kena stop juga sama macam dia orang
and lagi teruk
ya I mean but what lucky enough juga what if kalau kau dah baru graduate
kau baru graduate last year probably baru nak start kerja dah
you know but now lucky enough macam kau ada time untuk breather you know a bit breather and
you can have time untuk
apa kau nak buat ready untuk next you know
because right now also everything macam kau was talking about
uh all this macam kerja dekat dalam studio
and you know right now everyone was really macam
mm really macam
ya lah tak tak boleh go out for
for in the studio pun kalau tak betul-betul
and even now the studio are all not operating pun
ya it's like the same thing like what happened dekat ini juga
crazy times juga
youtube just used whatever content you know macam
ya semua orang macam
anyhow ah kira macam sembarang ah kira uh it's ya
and even macam sekarang ini macam netflix and there are big big err
but how they going to use all these macam despite of time
you know macam how can they macam selit how can they like you know err
aku I'm very sure there will be there will be light somewhere
it's just that macam
aku rasa don't don't don't give up don't give up for the sake of giving up just because you tak macam
but the thing is take it as if macam there's a new skill yang kau belajar
like also kau kena ingat juga since kau cakap video dah ada
aku rasa you should share it ah you know macam
because like ya macam
is is like apa
somebody dekat dalam kat india
I mean iphone punya itu okay lah no I mean iphone bad examples because they already copyrighted all the
all the way the series so like in that same vein you can actually do that ya like if you wanted money ah you know unless dia orang macam like ah okay ah kita skip one generation that kind of thing so it will be very weird it will be like
then five is apa roman numerical V
I mean I have tukar topik ah like I have troubles
cannot sia boring gila siol
boring gila
no that's the thing the other thing is I have to clarify was apa this transport allowance right
gaji then like for what sia

the first one was too tight ya that one that one was too tight but okay ah the rest all fine so okay ah apa-apa ah
in other formation gegenpress ah so tak boleh just sembarangan ah ni
the what what clubs other than the english premier league tak ada logo
so so apa uh what what what club are you planning to manage
on aku main is that time time poly is sixteen
ah before download it your kau nya laptop macam mana like what is the specifications cause aku tak nak
which apa brand ah
NVIDIA uh have semua semua all have ah
laptop boleh pakai ke tak untuk
apparently okay for for for for storage data I have a lot memang ada banyak lah

all these is over then maybe aku will check it out lah
takde ah I don't have I don't have the the the
tak baru it's it's quite latest one you know it's two thousand nineteen era
but I don't have the LAN cable cause well is more to you know more to notebook yang flat flat those ah
those ah ah okay the the reason why aku ada this laptop is pasal mak aku nak buat you know photoshop and and whatever nonsense ah
so and that one is used to for my adik punya apa tu school
which Zoom pun boleh lag
no I mean sorry let me be more specific opening Zoom dah lag
running the whole thing nak type password dah you know when you type your full password then it takes a few second before the password starts to appear ah then
that cleaner equipment last longer blah blah blah but I don't know how my little brother pakai you know go to school carry here carry there sometimes go to
nanti eh so
the whole day ah nanti kau ah kau keluar
new features with you that I may not be familiar with ah tapi
maybe take a good look about it tengok-tengok look
real good imagine I mean if you maybe look the singapore league dia cakap
ah new season pe new season they go home and whatnot then how they gonna come back I lost a lot of star player then I got the argentinian guy or whatever his name is in johor ah ya takzim darussalam eh johor takzim
that is kalau ada orang
apa nobody give
serie A apa punya guess
actually quite sad eh kalau kau if you're from the
it be quite you know quite sedih kan actually to be what to be honest
but ah english english wise takde
takde tak I I I've seen the
english punya league
cam the championship league one league two blah blah blah blah blah you know
ye from national then north south
which is on the same path they still have below and below and below ada below what the heck I think I think it's
regulate themselves dissolve all the useless clubs cause I think it's too much imagine kalau you know
singapore ada
S league delta league don't know what actually kita ada lah that is why the government decide to dissolve
I mean ya lah I mean that macam adik aku every
every night ah dia ah he come back from his camp army camp nanti around
maybe six plus dia makan by seven he will be out
dengan member member dia uh kat bawah block
then main bola sampai pukul sepuluh balik
so everyday like this but he's not gonna tell us lah whether he he play in league ke he play in what nonsense ah cause
he has to play football I think it's not no longer fun anymore ah abeh takkan takkan seh eh
nak main bola like every single day at this certain time wearing this certain jersey with certain boot I think it's a bit
whatever it is ah but there's a lot of african kid who's buncit so I can relate
year one eh kena okay anyway ah
seven years that's lama pe aku poly
bankrupt aku wait wait wait
tahun empat tahun pastu ah enam enam years ah I haven't been playing football actually lama pe
no body contact I mean this is the rules and regulation by that one no body contact so kalau nak tackle
you just eh aku tackle kau okay then tu bola kau lepaskan
ya actually true still two years ago at least after army CISCO after CISCO I dah dah don't
takde time you want to sleep more then work
spartan the hello universe but then if they are just standing down there looking at itik ayam kambing
how many times kita ah punya
ah ministers cakap apa unprecedented crisis
ah ya aku tahu aku tahu
but you minum how many times you cannot berbual tamil tau
dub boleh eh ah I mean kalau kau I mean if you just say vote for me for example vote for me I also can ah
in in in that language do you listen in melayu or do you listen in
ah what's that called ah my nenek my
once you grow old he say bila once dah tua
with walking stick like dia datang
and of all the language she choose abeh luckily she didn't choose
malaysian old lady and a old lady in malaysia apa
you know you cannot say even you're not even supposed to eh nenek you want go where no no you say oh where you heading ma'am
it's like dok cik you know it sound so weird know
and dia punya english is really tiptop ah so I I I suspect
aiya I mean in the first place maybe ada the word datuk kat depan dia punya dia punya
then mati ah tak boleh berbual ah
but ah ye lah true
when old people ask us eh dah kahwin eh dah ni dah tu you answer also they are not gonna listen pe they just gonna keep asking whatever we talk they just talk pe unless you want to
wait wait and he and he said multiple times dia tak nak interrupt us he don't want to he pe he just over here he don't want interrupt us
aku nampak dia minum tu kat bawah sini pasal you know why or not you know why or not
dia tinggal tingkat lapan that time that time aku that time aku nampak dia keluar nasib aku pakai mask dengan topi sia you know
then he look at me he and he ask me nak pergi tingkat mana hello I mean I'm not trying to be rude or anything
there's a very high chance I'm not judging I'm not judgemental ke apa benda
I mean technically asu pe asu terperanjat lah that you
you came in a very quiet manner cause there's is kau datang awkward sia
time ke
time aku asal ah kau datang
macam if you're just being stuck here I mean you know how it feels pe to be stuck at home
like there's no purpose at least kalau kau you know kau gi kerja there is a purpose I in life
do you think do you think dorang will
the other side will be like uh oh no I want this one ah eh you cannot I plan already mah so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think eh want to get married it's not going to be uh sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later lah nanti dulu berbual so sekarang kita go dulu then kalau later part then we can plan lepas tu buat plan K uh getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house mah
so that's for me it's very simple I don't like macam you know lah to me a rocket go to the moon how to plan that thing no need no need no need no no no no I'm not I'm not very detail so as long as happy to see
yang kat mana where at where
why because it really trigger my nerve you know what when you want to do kad jemputan it's a wedding card ah eh so when want to do kad jemputan it's like
tak ya

kasut kasut ketat tak tak ada tak ada tak ada I don't I don't I don't have think of that cause that time for
tak payah fikir sangat ya
the best part dia punya hari tak hujan tu jer for me it's the weather ah for me for it uh dia punya for me is the weather I cuaca dia yes correct
macam dia tak susah nak dapat tu weather that time out of what january eh month of january right dia dia macam tak nak kata panas tak boleh tau pasal I'm very stable outdoor tau dia kat luar
uh okay tempat dia okay just under void deck juga kan uh kita ambil kat void deck kita book void deck so kita plan nak booking void deck malaysia dia tak ada ada ada orang book kan they're taking up other events something like that it's very dia punya port dah okay tau so one thing's uh kita dah book then apa lagi
about the ada ada water utilities right you have to go something like that and everything uh under under that lah so make sure yang siapa yang nak kahwin uh kat you know void deck ke apa kan make sure you do your planning well I'm talking about the place ah ya
kan oh really kenapa eh
kenapa eh
for how many pack berapa orang dia eh okay
oh macam the brides woman jadi batman eh
mm lima puluh eh oh tak I think dua
three tiga tu tiga oh tiga eh uh first mm
slow down the process macam macam mana
maybe along the way they boleh buat photoshoot kan dalam kereta ke apa something like that tak eh
selit sikit lah tak ada selit
oh why kenapa
actually yang pasal your makcik tu dia memang cari pasal lah ya correct why why kenapa dia buat kenapa dia nak cakap macam tu kat depan mak you kan habis what your mum apa ada dua anak jer patut kena cakap balik
oh apa asal ha a bit
okay wedding eh kena uh nak uh apa uh dia dengan kompang tu
kan that time wow that time I macam ada crusader datang tapi tu semua dah plan lah so I cannot use my proceed kompang macam macam lain-lain team pula kalau tak I smile I tak ada uh plan but it goes well
sometimes it doesn't plan well it doesn't plan before but it goes well so it's like it's like macam cool lah eh tak tak
tak cakap pun ni semua jadi sendiri eh I was like happy ah my brother was there uh my adik was there with me dia dia yang plan macam mana dia punya line up so I was uh wow that's my first time tau I tak macam prepare all this eh asal my brother know ah ah that time ya brothers are quite okay lah my best man there that time
okay so uh kompang the the luckiest I mean the best part is the kompang weather and I also uh when I came to the pelamin then I saw you there sitting
then uh that's where I meet my wife and mak andam dia cover muka dia everything like that something like that tapi ada ada hadang eh
quite fun lah but that time tak ada macam rabak punya pakai apa uh padlock ke apa nak pecahkan kunci tak ada ah but just that dia very straightforward yes
and dapat tahu siapa more yang I dah kenal kenal lah yang tak kenal tu uh kat sana baru kenal tahu macam eh quite cool juga eh I mean of course the yang paling bising pun ada
of course they are part I think I think I think your family side is the loudest and have had have more uh fun there ah quite lucky you know actually it's throughout is the families getting to know each other I mean mak dia also apa welcoming me as a new guy in the family ya
tapi kita tak boleh buat like second round dua round tiga round tak boleh the best part
talking about the ballroom let's say ah you want to go to the what orange ballroom kita tak boleh makan ke
dah jalan dah kahwin if can rewind something like that ya
okay I first thing is sad one thing is happy okay the sad part the the wedding is over and it turn actually it turn out well lah okay and dia tak ada macam problem macam power trip ke apa tak ada it just went well so the event
dah habis kan so kita dah
dah apa dah stand down everything then
not say happy but I'm very like macam uh conscious ah what where to step everything it's not like macam wah this another episode it must be a difficulty at anywhere and at any corner will come
so what I'm I'm telling myself okay so kita then I think banyak tengok movie ah or drama orang-orang kahwin semua macam ni everything macam mana how dia dia dia plan dia rely on everything so nak recalled that back dia then kena ikut cerita apa dah jadi movie or drama dia jadi you know but I want to be my own drama
I want to be my own so I cannot tell them eh apa nak buat next ah siapa nak tanya my father or my mother or wherever yang dah pernah kahwin eh apa nak buat next ah it's like kental ah so I'm a man now I don't care so now you got own you got own way so you have it's a fun life ah
whether you what you want it to be so you nak macam mana you just create yourself until now I'm still creating so as a husband I as a husband
I'm talking for myself right uh I want to be very thrill I mean not really straight ah kadang-kadang corner a bit so you know ah you know the road well dia tak ada macam uh always straight jer ada ya lah kadang-kadang kita straight pun
boring apa straight road mesti ada corner left a bit sharp turn all these ah play along lah so how you handle okay first thing
uh that is me I cannot handle my wife if you if you can't handle me what I mean myself so this what I'm trying to say that kita if you handle myself unless you can handle anyone else so it's like that
so dah kahwin then uh ya then I rest at home
okay then don't play play anymore tak boleh macam berfoya-foya something like macam uh go anyhow and then I ask permission for my wife pasal kita dah kahwin sekarang kita tak boleh macam hanky-panky dulu bujang lain tak apa
we lepak bawah bawah block apa semua mak mak tak kisah so mak abah semua tak ali bila nak balik uh kau layan phone jer sekarang kalau wife lain tau dia tanya on the spot nak kena respond
dua missed call game
kiranya macam you're asking for trouble lah I know something will break or what itu eh wife punya side but dulu tak ah so this what is a discipline ah so you have to be more not say matured more discipline and care your wife be accompany with her so that everything goes well actually when I think ah
the more I care about my wife eh the more things I get you know like macam you there's something you return well lah something you don't know what is that but something you return you return well just nicely macam tak cakap dia dah fikir dulu tau ah something like that something like that if you if you think that way ah for me lah now right now that's one thing I like about her
if you give in she will also give back so fair lah ah for me it's fair if you now I don't have any like lepak dengan kawan tau dia tak macam call turun lepak lima lima empat pagi unless work lah unless work tu pun nasib dia punya
so ada lah sikit
uh not dia tak sama tapi serupa lah okay so pasal uh travelling eh okay start from travelling okay I as in start from our honeymoon lah the that is the starting of we how we can be linked
so there's no other dia tak ada pergi tempat lain tau macam long distance that time nak go mana ah pergi mana cambodia eh huh that time was the last time so I don't know that passport dah habis pasal I not a travelling guy
so bila part nak pergi honeymoon tu I using that passport lah yang lama tu then sampai airport
that time I thought my wife eh then kita baru kahwin kan so I thought she will get angry and shocked the whole airport can hear her voice but she relax already
dia tak marah dia just cakap aja alamak it's just I know that she's very disappointed you know
tapi dia tak expose dia punya marah tu kat airport so we plan that was macam I literally divert tau pergi malaysia
and then at malaysia passport I my passport lepas so dia kata can pass through ah my wife pergi book every yang mana yang nak pergi so that part eh she really a hardcore dia boleh book
so kita pergi mana dulu ah cameron highland first baru drop to cameron highland and port dickson so meaning we go three places lah eh under under malaysia state
I quite weird we having fun there lah it took part it's not it's not about malaysia you know it's the how we make that happen until now that's the best somehow eh kita nak pergi ah somewhere like macam uh korea ke itu kita plan apa kita nak plan plan plan sampai pergi tapi ini tak tau dia nak pergi bandung dulu nak pergi bandung then airport uh then passport dia habis uh mati then lepas tu kita dapat tahu kita pergi tempat lain and that was not planned
mm so kita ramp
that time so I have to drive lah so then I think my wife my wife should realise lah until now eh I'm a good driver not punishment it's just that dia tahu tau eh my husband can you know something not something fall
someone can can bring up back macam I tak cakap eh awak I cannot drive lah malam ni
no no no no I will fork out I will fork out something you've resolved eh macam
masuk mati ke I've tried to make something better lah so that's why my driving skill come in about that time dia dah I dah drive dah berapa kali ah eh
so I got you're saying that I I I I got uh someone that yang macam
travels dengan parents tak ada boyfriend ya you see eh you can hear that or not tak ada boyfriend that will make I'm the guy okay so
so something lesson learned lah sometime kalau kita pergi bandung pun it's a one way trip dia tak pergi mana-mana tempat pun whereas kalau kat malaysia ni kita pergi macam
a few places lah banyak oh ada juga eh oh
by okay by the way kan uh insyaallah kalau abang you ada duduk sana all right
dia punya menyesal tu takde lah
pasal I I choose this what
so how you can say regret no no no no not not really lah if something like macam benda yang eh kalau tahu buat ni takde takde it just went well if I plan if I say that now
if I know I being I do that now macam sekarang kan baru nak menyesal then we're going backward
so tu yang best lah macam
marriage sekarang ni ke apa oh okay
of course kan masa tu berselerak lah
I I scared I takut bila kalau my wife dia
uh suruh buat ni suruh buat tu uh tak boleh tidur rumah I tak tengok mak I something like that lah kena very like macam doesn't goes well lah once ada ah I don't like kadang-kadang kan ada orang kahwin dia straightaway eh
kat dia punya in-law jer
I don't know mungkin dia takde can nak tengok adik sendiri for me I I don't have that my wife give me freedom to go play especially
see my wife jalan-jalan makan dengan dia orang semua ya my wife is very fair very fair so we have this uh fairness lah ha so vice versa if for me kalau apa yang dia buat tu tak salah kan dalam segi undang-undang and dengan undang-undang agama then why not just try lah so try something new cause dia try something new ni kadang-kadang dia tak boleh macam
macam lama punya style jer so kita nak kena understand kita dah apa dah zaman ni sekarang kan zaman sekarang ni kita
a lot of things all or way we can uh do business ke apa ke so you have to try it out
bersyukur sekarang ni dah dia punya takde macam apa selisih faham lah
try to be more okay dia I think ah okay my wife dia nak ambil lesen tau okay I know this lesson we will take one or two years maybe or months only but
kalau dia drive tu I think she can bring me anywhere lah might be it's her turn after five years I bring eh another five years is her turn lah
dia punya turn so hopefully kalau dia dapat drive kan untuk suami suami dia ni yang very cute ni also cute you know I'm very cute also and of course ah ya so hopefully that's my request mah and drive me anywhere
I like I like her cooking until now no failure especially my recipes I just left my recipes recently there's I just finish ah so she cook for me every night shift so that's the best part day shift pun sama yes
I like her cooking actually uh she can cook well better than me ah that part I cannot take ah they cannot part they cannot challenge thank you sayang
